### [1] [McBE: A Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02088)
*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces McBE, a multi-task Chinese bias evaluation benchmark for LLMs, addressing gaps in existing datasets by covering diverse bias categories and tasks. It evaluates popular LLMs, revealing varying bias levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias evaluation datasets are limited to English/North American culture and lack multi-task support, necessitating a Chinese-focused benchmark.

Method: Developed McBE with 4,077 instances, 12 bias categories, 82 subcategories, and 5 evaluation tasks, then tested on various LLMs.

Result: All evaluated LLMs showed biases, with McBE providing comprehensive insights into bias patterns.

Conclusion: McBE fills a critical gap in bias evaluation for Chinese LLMs, offering a versatile tool for ethical AI development.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Reasoning or Not? A Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning LLMs for Dialogue Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02145)
*Keyan Jin,Yapeng Wang,Leonel Santos,Tao Fang,Xu Yang,Sio Kei Im,Hugo Gonçalo Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs for dialogue summarization, finding stepwise reasoning often harms performance by causing verbosity and inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of reasoning LLMs (e.g., Long CoT) in dialogue summarization, which remains unexplored despite their success in other tasks.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs across three paradigms (generic, role-oriented, query-oriented) using benchmarks like SAMSum and advanced metrics.

Result: Reasoning LLMs underperform non-reasoning ones, producing verbose, inconsistent, and less concise summaries.

Conclusion: Current reasoning LLMs have limitations for dialogue summarization, calling for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

### [3] [Latent Chain-of-Thought? Decoding the Depth-Recurrent Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02199)
*Wenquan Lu,Yuechuan Yang,Kyle Lee,Yanshu Li,Enqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether latent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning emerges in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer, finding limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT and inconsistent probing results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if recurrent architectures like Huginn-3.5B can internalize reasoning steps (latent CoT) without externalizing them in natural language, balancing efficiency and interpretability.

Method: Probing techniques (Logit Lens, Coda Lens) are used to analyze Huginn-3.5B's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks, tracking rank trajectories of tokens.

Result: Limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT; probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks; marginal gains from increased recurrence depth.

Conclusion: Latent CoT in Huginn-3.5B is less effective than explicit externalized reasoning, highlighting challenges in balancing efficiency and interpretability.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

### [4] [GDC Cohort Copilot: An AI Copilot for Curating Cohorts from the Genomic Data Commons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02221)
*Steven Song,Anirudh Subramanyam,Zhenyu Zhang,Aarti Venkat,Robert L. Grossman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GDC Cohort Copilot is an open-source tool that uses LLMs to convert natural language descriptions into GDC cohort filters, outperforming GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users struggle to navigate complex cohort creation in GDC; natural language descriptions could simplify this process.

Method: Developed and evaluated multiple LLMs, including a locally-served open-source model, to generate cohort filters from natural language.

Result: The GDC Cohort LLM outperforms GPT-4o in generating accurate cohorts.

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot effectively bridges the gap between natural language and complex cohort creation, offering a user-friendly solution.

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.
  Availability and implementation: The standalone docker image for GDC Cohort
Copilot is available at https://quay.io/repository/cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot.
Source code is available at https://github.com/uc-cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot. GDC

### [5] [MemAgent: Reshaping Long-Context LLM with Multi-Conv RL-based Memory Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02259)
*Hongli Yu,Tinghong Chen,Jiangtao Feng,Jiangjie Chen,Weinan Dai,Qiying Yu,Ya-Qin Zhang,Wei-Ying Ma,Jingjing Liu,Mingxuan Wang,Hao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemAgent optimizes long-text tasks with a novel workflow, achieving strong performance on very long documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling infinitely long documents efficiently without performance loss is a key challenge in long-text processing.

Method: Introduces MemAgent, which processes text in segments and updates memory with an overwrite strategy, using an extended DAPO algorithm for training.

Result: Achieves <5% performance loss on a 3.5M QA task and >95% on a 512K RULER test, extrapolating from 8K to 32K training.

Conclusion: MemAgent effectively addresses long-text challenges with scalable performance.

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

### [6] [DoMIX: An Efficient Framework for Exploiting Domain Knowledge in Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02302)
*Dohoon Kim,Donghun Kang,Taesup Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DoMIX introduces a novel approach for continual domain-adaptive pre-training (DAP) using LoRA modules, addressing computational cost, domain order sensitivity, and task-specific model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual DAP methods are computationally expensive, sensitive to data order, and provide generalized models, contradicting DAP's purpose.

Method: Leverages LoRA modules for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling efficient, parallel, and order-robust domain-adaptive pre-training.

Result: DoMIX efficiently provides tailored pre-trained models for specific tasks and extends to standard LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DoMIX successfully addresses limitations of continual DAP, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for domain-specific pre-training.

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available
at https://github.com/dohoonkim-ai/DoMIX.

### [8] [QFFN-BERT: An Empirical Study of Depth, Performance, and Data Efficiency in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02364)
*Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFFN-BERT replaces classical FFNs in BERT with parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), achieving higher accuracy with fewer parameters and better data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFNs dominate parameter count in Transformers; PQCs offer a parameter-efficient and expressive alternative.

Method: Hybrid quantum-classical transformer with PQC-based FFNs, using residual connections, RY/RZ rotations, and alternating entanglement for stability.

Result: QFFN-BERT achieves 102% baseline accuracy, reduces FFN parameters by 99%, and excels in few-shot learning.

Conclusion: PQCs, when co-designed with deep learning principles, are powerful and efficient alternatives to classical FFNs.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

### [9] [Efficient Code LLM Training via Distribution-Consistent and Diversity-Aware Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02378)
*Weijie Lyu,Sheng-Jun Huang,Xuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method using a parametric model for code data selection improves training efficiency and model performance, achieving gains with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods prioritize data quantity over quality, reducing training efficiency.

Method: Utilizes a parametric model to select high-quality code data, ensuring distribution consistency and diversity.

Result: Achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) with only 10K samples, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The method enhances model performance and reduces computational costs effectively.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

### [10] [Benchmarking Akan ASR Models Across Domain-Specific Datasets: A Comparative Evaluation of Performance, Scalability, and Adaptability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02407)
*Mark Atta Mensah,Isaac Wiafe,Akon Ekpezu,Justice Kwame Appati,Jamal-Deen Abdulai,Akosua Nyarkoa Wiafe-Akenten,Frank Ernest Yeboah,Gifty Odame*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarks seven Akan ASR models on diverse datasets, revealing domain dependency and distinct error behaviors between Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation of ASR models' generalization across diverse speech contexts, particularly for low-resource languages like Akan.

Method: Benchmarked seven transformer-based Akan ASR models (Whisper, Wav2Vec2) using four diverse Akan speech corpora, analyzing word and character error rates.

Result: Models performed best within their training domains but degraded in mismatched scenarios. Whisper produced fluent but misleading errors, while Wav2Vec2 had obvious but less interpretable errors.

Conclusion: Targeted domain adaptation, adaptive routing, and multilingual training are needed for Akan and other low-resource languages, considering the trade-off between readability and transparency in ASR errors.

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

Motivation: To democratize ASR technology for impaired speech in low-resource languages by enabling community-driven data collection and model building.

Method: Developed a cookbook of best practices, curated an open-source dataset of impaired speech in Akan, and fine-tuned open-source ASR models.

Result: Produced the first open-source impaired speech dataset in Akan, along with tools and initial fine-tuning results for ASR models.

Conclusion: The study successfully created resources to support inclusive ASR technology development for speech-impaired individuals in low-resource languages.

Abstract: This study presents an approach for collecting speech samples to build
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models for impaired speech, particularly,
low-resource languages. It aims to democratize ASR technology and data
collection by developing a "cookbook" of best practices and training for
community-driven data collection and ASR model building. As a proof-of-concept,
this study curated the first open-source dataset of impaired speech in Akan: a
widely spoken indigenous language in Ghana. The study involved participants
from diverse backgrounds with speech impairments. The resulting dataset, along
with the cookbook and open-source tools, are publicly available to enable
researchers and practitioners to create inclusive ASR technologies tailored to
the unique needs of speech impaired individuals. In addition, this study
presents the initial results of fine-tuning open-source ASR models to better
recognize impaired speech in Akan.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebSailor introduces a post-training method to enhance LLMs' ability to handle high-uncertainty tasks, matching proprietary models like DeepResearch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between open-source and proprietary LLMs in handling complex, uncertain information-seeking tasks.

Method: Uses structured sampling, information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and the DUPO algorithm for agentic RL training.

Result: WebSailor outperforms open-source agents and matches proprietary models in performance.

Conclusion: The method effectively instills systematic reasoning in LLMs, closing the capability gap with proprietary systems.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

### [14] [Revisiting Active Learning under (Human) Label Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02593)
*Cornelia Gruber,Helen Alber,Bernd Bischl,Göran Kauermann,Barbara Plank,Matthias Aßenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of label variation (LV) in supervised learning, emphasizing human label variation (HLV) as an informative signal. It critiques assumptions in active learning (AL) and proposes a framework for HLV-aware AL, including LLM integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label variation is common but often treated as noise, overlooking HLV as a valuable signal. AL assumptions rarely account for HLV, limiting practical applicability.

Method: The paper decomposes LV into signal (HLV) and noise, surveys AL and LV literature, and proposes a conceptual framework for HLV-aware AL, including LLM annotators.

Result: A framework for integrating HLV into AL is introduced, addressing instance selection, annotator choice, and label representation.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for HLV-aware AL, better reflecting real-world annotation complexities and leveraging LLMs.

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

### [15] [MPF: Aligning and Debiasing Language Models post Deployment via Multi Perspective Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02595)
*Xin Guan,PeiHsin Lin,Zekun Wu,Ze Wang,Ruibo Zhang,Emre Kazim,Adriano Koshiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MPF is a posttraining framework for bias mitigation in LLMs, using multiperspective generations to align outputs with humanlike baselines, reducing bias without extensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for scalable and interpretable bias mitigation in LLMs without requiring prompt engineering or finetuning.

Method: Leverages SAGED pipeline to construct bias benchmarks, decomposes baselines into interpretable components, and guides generation via weighted sampling.

Result: Aligns LLM outputs with counterfactual and HR baselines, reducing KL divergence and calibration error while generalizing to unseen questions.

Conclusion: MPF provides a scalable, interpretable solution for bias mitigation in deployed LLMs.

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and quantify gender biases in language, especially beyond occupational stereotypes.

Method: Introduces GenderLexicon dataset and a framework to estimate and score contextual and gender biases.

Result: Confirms existence of gender biases beyond occupations; framework improves bias explainability.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, validated on diverse datasets, including Japanese.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the correlation between gender and contextual
biases, focusing on elements such as action verbs, object nouns, and
particularly on occupations. We introduce a novel dataset, GenderLexicon, and a
framework that can estimate contextual bias and its related gender bias. Our
model can interpret the bias with a score and thus improve the explainability
of gender bias. Also, our findings confirm the existence of gender biases
beyond occupational stereotypes. To validate our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness, we conduct evaluations on five diverse datasets, including a
Japanese dataset.

### [17] [Can LLMs Identify Critical Limitations within Scientific Research? A Systematic Evaluation on AI Research Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02694)
*Zhijian Xu,Yilun Zhao,Manasi Patwardhan,Lovekesh Vig,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LimitGen, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to assist peer review by identifying limitations in AI research, using synthetic and human-written datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing volume of scientific publications makes peer review challenging, and LLMs' potential to assist in identifying limitations is understudied.

Method: Developed LimitGen, a benchmark with synthetic (LimitGen-Syn) and human-written (LimitGen-Human) datasets, augmented with literature retrieval for grounding.

Result: The approach enhances LLMs' capability to generate concrete and constructive feedback on research limitations.

Conclusion: LimitGen demonstrates the potential of LLMs to support early-stage peer review by identifying limitations, complementing human efforts.

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

### [18] [Measurement of the Granularity of Vowel Production Space By Just Producible Different (JPD) Limens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02744)
*Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper measures the 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD) in vowel mimicry, finding it ranges between 14-51 mels, impacting theories of speech production and vowel system structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the accuracy of sub-phonemic control in vowel production by quantifying the minimal auditory distance (JPD) required for reliable imitation.

Method: A vowel mimicry paradigm was used with English speakers to measure JPD in F1 X F2 space for front vowels.

Result: JPD was estimated between 14 and 51 mels, indicating the minimal auditory difference needed for distinct vowel imitation.

Conclusion: The findings support episodic theories of speech production and provide a psychophysical basis for understanding vowel system structures, setting a lower bound for vowel phoneme proximity.

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

### [19] [Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02778)
*Ken Tsui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit a 'Self-Correction Blind Spot,' failing to correct their own errors despite identifying errors in user input. A framework (Self-Correction Bench) reveals a 64.5% blind spot rate, linked to training data. Adding 'Wait' reduces blind spots by 89.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study and address the systematic failure of LLMs to self-correct errors in their own outputs, despite their ability to correct user input errors.

Method: Introduced Self-Correction Bench, a framework for controlled error injection at three complexity levels, tested on 14 models.

Result: Average 64.5% blind spot rate; training data composition (lack of error-correction examples) is a key factor. Adding 'Wait' reduces blind spots by 89.3%.

Conclusion: Highlights a critical LLM limitation and suggests training and prompting improvements for reliability.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

### [20] [Is Reasoning All You Need? Probing Bias in the Age of Reasoning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02799)
*Riccardo Cantini,Nicola Gabriele,Alessio Orsino,Domenico Talia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMs with reasoning capabilities (CoT or fine-tuned) are more vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models, challenging the assumption that reasoning improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how reasoning capabilities in RLMs affect their robustness to social biases, using the CLEAR-Bias benchmark.

Method: Systematic evaluation of RLMs using the CLEAR-Bias benchmark, LLM-as-a-judge scoring, and jailbreak techniques to assess safety mechanisms.

Result: Reasoning-enabled models are more vulnerable to bias elicitation, with CoT prompting being particularly prone to contextual reframing attacks.

Conclusion: Reasoning may unintentionally reinforce stereotypes, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning design.

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

### [21] [Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning with Diverse Solving Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02804)
*Wenhao Shi,Zhiqiang Hu,Yi Bin,Yang Yang,See-Kiong Ng,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MathV-DP dataset and Qwen-VL-DP model enhance multimodal LLMs by incorporating diverse reasoning perspectives and reflective reasoning, outperforming prior models in accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for math reasoning lack diversity in solutions and reflections, limiting their reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces MathV-DP dataset with diverse solution trajectories and Qwen-VL-DP model, fine-tuned with supervised learning and GRPO for diversity-aware rewards.

Result: Qwen-VL-DP outperforms prior MLLMs in accuracy and generative diversity on MathVista and Math-V benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating diverse perspectives and reflective reasoning improves multimodal mathematical reasoning performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

### [22] [SynapseRoute: An Auto-Route Switching Framework on Dual-State Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02822)
*Wencheng Zhang,Shiqin Qiao,Lingjie Luo,Yinfeng Li,Chuanyang Zheng,Qian Xu,Meng Li,Yong Gui,Yijun He,Jianing Qiu,Jindong Hong,Jiankai Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynapseRoute, a dynamic routing framework for LLMs that optimizes cost and performance by assigning queries to either high-reasoning or low-cost modes based on complexity. It shows significant improvements in accuracy, speed, and cost-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cost-performance trade-off in LLMs by leveraging the observation that many queries don't require high-reasoning, thus optimizing resource use.

Method: Proposes SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based framework that dynamically routes queries to thinking or non-thinking modes based on complexity.

Result: SynapseRoute improves accuracy (0.8390 vs. 0.8272), reduces inference time by 36.8%, and cuts token consumption by 39.66%. It also avoids over-reasoning pitfalls.

Conclusion: Dynamic routing based on query complexity optimizes LLM performance, balancing accuracy, speed, and cost, as demonstrated by the AIT index.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

### [23] [Generalizing Verifiable Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02833)
*Valentina Pyatkin,Saumya Malik,Victoria Graf,Hamish Ivison,Shengyi Huang,Pradeep Dasigi,Nathan Lambert,Hannaneh Hajishirzi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IFBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI models' ability to generalize precise instruction following, and proposes RLVR (reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with generalizing precise instruction following, especially for unseen output constraints, despite overfitting on benchmark data.

Method: The authors design IFBench with 58 diverse constraints, develop constraint verification modules, and use RLVR for training.

Result: RLVR significantly improves models' ability to follow precise instructions, and the paper releases new training constraints and tools.

Conclusion: The work advances AI-human interaction by addressing generalization in precise instruction following and provides resources for future research.

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

*Almog Hilel,Idan Shenfeld,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user feedback allows a single user to persistently alter LM knowledge and behavior by manipulating prompts and feedback signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how malicious users can exploit feedback mechanisms in LMs to insert false knowledge, modify behavior, or introduce security flaws.

Method: Attackers prompt LMs to output poisoned or benign responses, then manipulate feedback (upvoting poisoned or downvoting benign outputs) to bias future LM behavior.

Result: The attack successfully inserts false facts, introduces security flaws in code generation, and injects fake financial news.

Conclusion: This reveals a new vulnerability in preference-tuned LMs, showing how limited feedback can exert fine-grained control, extending risks beyond pretraining or prompt injection.

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

*Purbesh Mitra,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOTIF introduces modular thinking via reinforcement finetuning to overcome LLM context size limits, improving reasoning accuracy with sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottleneck of LLM context size for reasoning tasks by enabling modular thinking over multiple rounds.

Method: Proposes MOTIF, an RL training method for generating thinking tokens in rounds, tested on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct using GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks.

Result: Achieved 3.8% and 3.3% accuracy improvements over GRPO, with 15% of samples, showing sample efficiency.

Conclusion: MOTIF effectively enhances LLM reasoning beyond context limits, demonstrating practical improvements and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and

*Nikhil Chandak,Shashwat Goel,Ameya Prabhu,Moritz Hardt,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques multiple choice benchmarks for language model evaluation, proposing generative evaluation via answer matching, which aligns better with human grading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of multiple choice benchmarks, which can be answered without understanding the question, and to explore a more valid evaluation method.

Method: Introduces answer matching: models generate free-form responses, and a modern language model checks alignment with reference answers. Human grading data from MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond is used to compare evaluation strategies.

Result: Answer matching achieves near-perfect agreement with human grading, outperforming multiple choice and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Model rankings change significantly with answer matching.

Conclusion: The paper advocates shifting from multiple choice to answer matching for more accurate and scalable language model evaluation.

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarking monocular depth estimation models in underwater environments, showing poor performance of terrestrial-trained models and improved results with domain-adapted fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unreliability of monocular depth estimation in underwater settings due to domain shifts like light attenuation and lack of high-quality ground-truth data.

Method: Evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned models on underwater datasets (FLSea, SQUID), fine-tuned Depth Anything V2 on synthetic underwater Hypersim data.

Result: Terrestrial-trained models perform poorly underwater; fine-tuned model outperforms baselines, showing domain adaptation's importance.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation and scale-aware supervision are crucial for robust underwater depth estimation, with fine-tuned models offering better performance.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ESTR-CoT, a novel chain-of-thought reasoning framework for event stream scene text recognition, addressing interpretability and contextual reasoning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack interpretability and contextual reasoning in event stream text recognition, especially in low illumination and fast motion scenarios.

Method: The framework uses EVA-CLIP for vision encoding, Llama tokenizer for prompt encoding, and Vicuna-7B for reasoning. It includes a large-scale CoT dataset for training.

Result: Experiments on EventSTR, WordArt*, and IC15* datasets validate the framework's effectiveness and interpretability.

Conclusion: ESTR-CoT offers a robust solution for event stream text recognition with improved reasoning and interpretability.

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on

TL;DR: A zero-shot multimodal approach for Compound Expression Recognition (CER) combines six modalities and uses CLIP-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic understanding, achieving competitive results without domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic emotions without relying on task-specific training data.

Method: Uses zero-shot components (CLIP, Qwen-VL), a Multi-Head Probability Fusion module, and Compound Expressions transformation with PPA and PFSA methods.

Result: Achieves F1 scores of 46.95% (AffWild2), 49.02% (AFEW), and 34.85% (C-EXPR-DB) via zero-shot testing, comparable to supervised approaches.

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures compound emotions without domain adaptation, demonstrating its potential for CER.

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

Motivation: To enhance scientific communication by exploring the potential of GAs and overcoming barriers like the need for advanced visualization skills.

Method: Introduces SciGA-145k dataset, defines two GA recommendation tasks (Intra-GA and Inter-GA), and proposes the CAR metric.

Result: Provides baseline models for GA tasks and a novel metric (CAR) for better analysis.

Conclusion: SciGA-145k advances visual scientific communication and supports AI for Science development.

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

### [32] [Understanding Trade offs When Conditioning Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02217)
*Brandon Trabucco,Qasim Wani,Benjamin Pikus,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores synthetic data generation for robust object detection in low-data regimes, comparing prompt-based and layout-based conditioning with diffusion models. Layout conditioning outperforms as diversity increases, significantly boosting detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning robust object detectors with limited training data, especially in industrial settings where data collection is time-consuming.

Method: Compares two conditioning strategies (prompt-based and layout-based) for synthetic data generation using diffusion models across 80 visual concepts from standard benchmarks.

Result: Layout conditioning excels with diverse cues, improving mean average precision by 34% on average and up to 177% compared to real data alone.

Conclusion: Layout-based conditioning in diffusion models is superior for generating high-quality synthetic data in diverse scenarios, enhancing object detection performance.

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

*Tian Gao,Zhiyuan Zhang,Kaijie Yin,Xu-Cheng Zhong,Hui Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIDB-ViT is a novel binary vision transformer that addresses performance degradation in existing methods by incorporating differential information in attention and using frequency decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the trade-off between computational efficiency and performance in binary ViTs, which often degrade or rely on full-precision modules.

Method: Proposes DIDB-ViT with an informative attention module, frequency decomposition via Haar wavelet, and an improved RPReLU activation function.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art quantization methods in ViTs, achieving superior image classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT effectively balances efficiency and performance, making it suitable for edge-device deployment.

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMOcc improves 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving by refining features with a flow matching model and selective filtering, outperforming existing methods with fewer frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D occupancy prediction rely on historical frame data, requiring extra resources and compromising accuracy for occluded/distant scenes.

Method: FMOcc uses a flow matching SSM module (FMSSM) for feature refinement, TPV SSM layer, and Plane Selective SSM (PS3M) for selective filtering, along with Mask Training (MT) for robustness.

Result: FMOcc achieves 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes and 42.6% RayIoU on OpenOcc with efficient memory (5.4G) and speed (330ms).

Conclusion: FMOcc offers a resource-efficient and accurate solution for few-frame 3D occupancy prediction, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical enhancement algorithms are limited to single tasks, reducing their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios.

Method: The proposed SurgVisAgent uses a prior model for domain knowledge and employs in-context few-shot learning with chain-of-thought reasoning for customized image enhancements.

Result: Extensive experiments on a benchmark show SurgVisAgent outperforms traditional single-task models.

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent demonstrates potential as a unified solution for diverse surgical enhancement tasks.

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-label methods fail to capture the complexity of post-hurricane damage, necessitating a more accurate and timely assessment for disaster response.

Method: Integrates ResNet-based feature extraction and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify multiple damage types in a single image.

Result: Achieves 90.23% mean average precision on the Rescuenet dataset from Hurricane Michael, surpassing existing methods.

multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and

*Yuxiang Zhang,Wei Li,Wen Jia,Mengmeng Zhang,Ran Tao,Shunlin Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for cross-domain hyperspectral image classification, using a triple-branch transformer to extract domain-invariant and domain-specific features, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spectral shifts in hyperspectral images across different regions/times by enhancing adaptability and separability for target scenes.

Method: BiDA framework with a triple-branch transformer (source, target, coupled branches), CMCA mechanism for feature interaction, bi-directional distillation loss, and Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3%~5% in cross-temporal tree species classification.

Conclusion: BiDA effectively handles cross-domain HSI classification by leveraging domain-invariant and specific features, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from visibility and color issues due to light changes, turbidity, and bubbles, which existing methods fail to address effectively.

Method: The MAC-Lookup model combines Conditional 3D Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for initial color correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement, avoiding over-enhancement.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate MAC-Lookup's superior performance in restoring details and colors compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MAC-Lookup effectively enhances underwater images, addressing key challenges and outperforming prior approaches.

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.
This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater
challenges. Extensive experiments show that MAC-Lookup excels in enhancing
underwater images by restoring details and colors better than existing methods.

TL;DR: A self-distillation method improves Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation by incorporating cinematic language, enhancing performance in partial visibility scenarios and on the VGGSound dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A methods ignore cinematic language, leading to poor performance when Foley targets are partially visible.

Method: Proposes a self-distillation approach to train V2A models by simulating cinematic language variations, aligning video features with audio-visual correspondences.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in partial visibility scenarios and boosts performance on the VGGSound dataset.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the limitations of current V2A models by integrating cinematic language, improving both partial visibility handling and general performance.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaCo introduces layer-wise visual token compression within vision encoders, improving efficiency and performance over post-encoder methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token compression methods for MLLMs are post-encoder, limiting efficiency gains. LaCo aims to compress tokens within intermediate layers for better performance.

Method: LaCo uses a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism and residual learning with non-parametric shortcuts to merge and preserve visual tokens.

Result: LaCo outperforms existing methods, improving training efficiency by over 20% and inference throughput by 15% while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: LaCo is a superior framework for visual token compression, offering efficiency and performance benefits over traditional methods.

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for domain generalization (DG) using text-guided visual prompt tuning and introduces WERA to enhance visual feature disentanglement, outperforming state-of-the-art DG methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of designing prompts to disentangle invariant features across diverse domains in VFM-based DG.

Method: Leverages VFM's language prompt for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning, uses LLM for text prompt disentanglement, and introduces WERA for enhanced visual representation alignment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods on major datasets like PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses DG challenges by combining text-guided disentanglement with visual alignment, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViRefSAM improves SAM's performance in remote sensing by automating prompts and adapting to domain-specific features using few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM struggles with manual prompt inefficiency and domain adaptability in remote sensing images.

Method: ViRefSAM introduces a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder and Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter to automate prompts and align domain-specific features.

Result: ViRefSAM outperforms existing methods on benchmarks like iSAID-5i, LoveDA-2i, and COCO-20i.

Conclusion: ViRefSAM enables accurate, automatic segmentation of unseen classes in remote sensing with minimal reference images.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with controllable novel view generation due to lack of multi-view information.

Method: Uses a view-aware 3D lifting module and multi-view feature fusion to integrate 3D representations into pre-trained diffusion models.

Result: Improves generation of controllable novel views and enables better 3D object reconstruction.

Conclusion: DreamComposer++ advances controllable novel view synthesis and broadens application possibilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Flow-CDNet, a dual-branch network for detecting both slow and fast changes in bitemporal images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow changes in bitemporal images are precursors to major hazards, necessitating a network that detects both slow and fast changes.

Method: Flow-CDNet uses an optical flow branch (pyramid structure) for displacement changes and a ResNet-based branch for fast changes, supervised by a new dataset (Flow-Change), loss function (binary tversky + L2), and metric (FEPE).

Result: Quantitative experiments show Flow-CDNet outperforms existing methods, with ablation studies confirming mutual enhancement of the two branches.

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet effectively detects slow and fast changes, validated by superior performance and branch synergy.

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

*Pei Guo,Ryan Farrell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMPNet discovers semantic keypoints weakly-supervised by category labels using a leaky max pooling layer and a clustering strategy, achieving accuracy comparable to supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover semantic object keypoints without strong supervision, relying only on category labels.

Method: Uses leaky max pooling (LMP) to encourage filters to learn non-repeatable local patterns, a selection strategy for consistency, and a clustering layer for keypoint prediction.

Result: LMPNet discovers robust semantic keypoints and matches supervised model accuracy.

Conclusion: LMPNet is an interpretable and effective method for weakly-supervised keypoint discovery.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using fMRI representations to improve semantic alignment in brain-vision decoding, enhancing object detection and segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brain-vision decoding methods lack fine-grained semantic alignment, causing reconstruction distortions. The study aims to better understand visual perception and improve semantic processing.

Method: An experimental framework injects fMRI representations into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, testing downstream performance on object detection and segmentation tasks.

Result: Incorporating fMRI signals improves detection and segmentation accuracy, revealing rich multi-object semantic cues and spatial localization information.

Conclusion: fMRI signals contain untapped semantic and spatial information, offering potential for enhancing current brain-vision decoding models.

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

### [47] [MAGIC: Mask-Guided Diffusion Inpainting with Multi-Level Perturbations and Context-Aware Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02314)
*JaeHyuck Choi,MinJun Kim,JeHyeong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC is a novel method for few-shot anomaly generation in industrial quality control, addressing three key demands: preserving normal backgrounds, precise anomaly inpainting, and semantically valid anomaly placement. It outperforms existing methods on the MVTec-AD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of anomaly data in industrial settings necessitates few-shot anomaly generation. Existing methods fail to simultaneously meet the requirements of background preservation, precise inpainting, and semantic validity.

Method: MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting backbone, adds Gaussian prompt-level perturbation and mask-guided spatial noise injection for diversity, and includes a context-aware mask alignment module for semantic validity.

Result: MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on the MVTec-AD dataset in downstream anomaly tasks.

Conclusion: MAGIC successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods, providing a robust solution for few-shot anomaly generation in industrial applications.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

*Zecheng Zhao,Selena Song,Tong Chen,Zhi Chen,Shazia Sadiq,Yadan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynTVA introduces a dataset and benchmark to evaluate synthetic videos' utility for text-to-video retrieval, focusing on semantic alignment and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V evaluation metrics lack insight into downstream task performance like retrieval, prompting the need for a specialized benchmark.

Method: SynTVA uses 800 user queries to generate synthetic videos, annotating them for semantic alignment (Object & Scene, Action, Attribute, Prompt Fidelity) and correlates VQA metrics with retrieval performance.

Result: SynTVA proves useful for dataset augmentation, improving TVR outcomes by selecting high-utility synthetic samples.

Conclusion: SynTVA provides a valuable tool for evaluating and enhancing synthetic video utility in retrieval tasks, with potential for scaling via an Auto-Evaluator.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

*Nina Konovalova,Maxim Nikolaev,Andrey Kuznetsov,Aibek Alanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InnerControl improves spatial control in text-to-image diffusion models by enforcing consistency across all denoising steps, outperforming prior methods like ControlNet++.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet++ focus on final denoising steps, neglecting intermediate stages, which limits spatial control precision.

Method: InnerControl trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct control signals from intermediate UNet features at every denoising step, using pseudo ground truth for training.

Result: The method enhances control fidelity and generation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance with diverse conditioning methods.

Conclusion: InnerControl effectively addresses spatial control challenges in diffusion models, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ANN-based Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) for rice leaf disease classification, comparing it with Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM). FADM outperforms DICDM, showing potential for improving crop health and yield.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rice leaf diseases cause economic losses, necessitating early detection for better management and productivity.

Method: Uses ANN-based FADM with FEAs, DRAs, FSAs, and ELM, comparing it to DICDM without FEAs. Evaluated on datasets of various diseases using 10-fold Cross-Validation.

Result: FADM achieves higher performance than DICDM in classifying rice leaf diseases.

Conclusion: FADM is effective for rice disease detection, promising improved crop health and sustainability.

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

*Rafic Nader,Vincent L'Allinec,Romain Bourcier,Florent Autrusseau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-step neural network approach for automated detection of intracranial aneurysm landmarks in the Circle of Willis, improving accuracy and reducing missed detections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of critical landmarks in the Circle of Willis is essential for efficient diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms.

Method: A two-step process: (1) object detection network identifies ROIs, (2) modified U-Net with deep supervision precisely locates bifurcations.

Result: Achieved highest performance in bifurcation detection, addressing challenges like close landmarks and anatomical variability.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for automated landmark detection in cerebral MRA datasets.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight YOLOv8n-based model for shrimp disease detection reduces computational complexity and improves accuracy, achieving a 32.3% parameter reduction and 92.7% mAP@0.5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shrimp diseases cause economic losses; efficient and accurate detection is needed to mitigate this.

Method: Proposes a lightweight YOLOv8n architecture with RLDD detection head, C2f-EMCM module, and SegNext_Attention for better feature extraction.

Result: Model achieves 92.7% mAP@0.5 (3% improvement), 32.3% fewer parameters, and outperforms other lightweight YOLO models.

Conclusion: The method balances accuracy and efficiency, offering reliable support for intelligent shrimp disease detection.

Abstract: Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp
aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection
efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network
architecture based on YOLOv8n. First, by designing the RLDD detection head and
C2f-EMCM module, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining
detection accuracy, improving computational efficiency. Subsequently, an
improved SegNext_Attention self-attention mechanism is introduced to further
enhance the model's feature extraction capability, enabling more precise
identification of disease characteristics. Extensive experiments, including
ablation studies and comparative evaluations, are conducted on a
self-constructed shrimp disease dataset, with generalization tests extended to
the URPC2020 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5
of 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms
other lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model
size. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the
model's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The
proposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency,
providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in
shrimp aquaculture.

*Anlin Zheng,Haochen Wang,Yucheng Zhao,Weipeng Deng,Tiancai Wang,Xiangyu Zhang,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hita is a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive image generation, improving global information capture and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive models and tokenizers lack holistic relationships and global information in image generation.

Method: Hita uses a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable queries, sequential token arrangement, and a fusion module for information control.

Result: Hita achieves 2.59 FID and 281.9 IS on ImageNet, with improved training speed and global property capture.

Conclusion: Hita enhances autoregressive image generation by prioritizing holistic tokens and demonstrates versatility in style transfer and in-painting.

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LocalDyGS introduces a novel framework for dynamic scene reconstruction, handling both large-scale and fine-scale motions by decomposing scenes into local spaces and decoupling static/dynamic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like neural radiance fields or 3D Gaussian splatting struggle with fine-scale motion and fail to model larger, complex dynamic scenes.

Method: LocalDyGS decomposes scenes into local spaces with seeds, captures motion within each space, and decouples static/dynamic features for modeling. Temporal Gaussians are generated to represent motion.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance on fine-scale datasets and is the first to model larger, highly dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: LocalDyGS advances dynamic scene reconstruction by realistically modeling complex motions, outperforming SOTA methods in scalability and realism.

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UVLM, an underwater observation benchmark for video language models (VidLMs), addressing gaps in existing terrestrial-focused works. It ensures data quality, diversity, and task variety, demonstrating improved underwater understanding and potential benefits for in-air benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VidLMs overlook underwater observation needs despite their demanding applications. UVLM aims to bridge this gap by providing a specialized benchmark.

Method: UVLM is constructed using human-AI collaboration, focusing on underwater challenges (light, turbidity, angles), diverse data (frame rates, resolutions, marine classes), and structured tasks (biological/environmental, 20 types). Challenging metrics are designed for evaluation.

Result: Fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM enhances underwater understanding and shows slight improvements on in-air benchmarks like VideoMME and Perception text.

Conclusion: UVLM fills a critical gap in VidLM applications, offering a robust benchmark for underwater scenarios with potential broader benefits.

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

TL;DR: A novel pseudo-labeling framework for monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) using video data, robust to occlusion and scalable without multi-view setups or domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and 2D-to-3D ambiguity in M3OD by leveraging video data and pseudo-labeling without additional sensors or domain constraints.

Method: Aggregates pseudo-LiDARs of static and dynamic objects across frames via object point tracking for 3D attribute extraction.

Result: Ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability in scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible.

Conclusion: Proposed framework is practical and effective for M3OD, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMEL introduces a continual MIL framework for localization with minimal forgetting, outperforming prior methods by up to 23.4% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of adaptability in MIL for continual tasks, especially in localization, due to challenges like large patch sizes and missing global relationships.

Method: CoMEL includes GDAT for instance encoding, BPPL for pseudo-labeling, and OWLoRA to reduce forgetting in classification.

Result: CoMEL achieves up to 11.00% higher bag-level accuracy and 23.4% better localization accuracy than previous methods.

Conclusion: CoMEL effectively addresses continual MIL challenges, offering improved localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deepfake video detection method using pixel-wise temporal inconsistencies and a joint transformer module for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional detectors miss temporal artifacts by focusing on spatial frequency spectra. This approach addresses that gap.

Method: Uses 1D Fourier transform on the time axis per pixel, an attention proposal module, and a joint transformer for feature integration.

Result: Detects temporal inconsistencies effectively, especially in unnatural movement areas, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: The framework advances deepfake detection by combining temporal and spatio-temporal features for robust performance.

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

TL;DR: TAB Net, a weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, uses triplet augmentation and boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision to improve segmentation under scribble annotations, achieving results close to fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation often requires costly fully annotated datasets. Scribble annotations are a cheaper alternative but lack sufficient supervision for training segmentation networks.

Method: TAB Net includes the TAS module (triplet augmentation for feature learning) and the BAP module (boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision for accuracy).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets, nearing fully supervised performance.

Conclusion: TAB Net effectively addresses the limitations of scribble annotations, offering a viable weakly-supervised solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

TL;DR: The paper explores self-supervised learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification, showing it outperforms supervised methods in robustness and performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wildlife re-identification relies on annotated data, which is costly. SSL offers a way to leverage unlabeled data from camera traps.

Method: Uses temporal image pairs from camera traps to train SSL models without supervision, then evaluates them in open-world and transfer learning scenarios.

Result: SSL models are more robust with limited data and outperform supervised features in all downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SSL is a promising alternative to supervised learning for wildlife re-identification, reducing reliance on annotated data.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Motivation: Diffusion models lack explicit semantic representation, unlike auto-encoders, which can map images to structured latent spaces. This work aims to bridge this gap for better interpretability and applications.

Method: The authors combine an encoder with a diffusion model to form an auto-encoding framework. They structure the latent space for brain image analysis, enforce positional regression, and develop unsupervised artifact restoration techniques.

Result: The method successfully structures latent space for brain tissue differentiation and enables unsupervised restoration of tear and JPEG artifacts using diffusion model capabilities.

Conclusion: The integration of auto-encoding with diffusion models enhances semantic representation and enables practical applications like artifact restoration, demonstrating the framework's versatility.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

*Duong Nguyen-Ngoc Tran,Long Hoang Pham,Chi Dai Tran,Quoc Pham-Nam Ho,Huy-Hung Nguyen,Jae Wook Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel tuning method for pedestrian tracking in thermal images improves accuracy by optimizing hyperparameters, achieving robust performance without complex models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal sensors enhance recognition in low-visibility conditions, but their low-level features challenge accurate pedestrian tracking.

Method: The framework optimizes two-stages with suitable hyperparameters, avoiding reliance on complex reidentification or motion models.

Result: Extensive experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset show high effectiveness across various thermal camera conditions.

Conclusion: The method is a robust solution for real-world surveillance, excelling in challenging environments.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

TL;DR: PFIP is a novel scheme for efficient face retrieval in ciphertext domains, reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the time-intensive nature of face retrieval in ciphertext domains due to growing template libraries and privacy concerns.

Method: PFIP uses a preselection mechanism and packing module to enhance efficiency and flexibility in biometric systems.

Result: Achieves 100% hit rate, retrieves 1,000 ciphertext templates in 300ms, and improves retrieval efficiency by 50x.

Conclusion: PFIP is a highly efficient and accurate solution for privacy-preserving face identification.

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep-learning ensemble model using residual U-Net architectures outperforms traditional methods in structural crack detection, offering higher accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual crack detection is slow and error-prone, risking public safety. The study aims to improve accuracy and reliability through automated deep-learning solutions.

Method: Residual U-Net models were integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model of convolutional blocks, tested against SegNet and traditional U-Net.

Result: The ensemble model achieved the highest IoU and DICE scores, outperforming individual models, especially with low-resolution images.

Conclusion: The ensemble model is highly effective for structural crack detection, paving the way for more reliable automated monitoring systems.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

### [65] [AvatarMakeup: Realistic Makeup Transfer for 3D Animatable Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02419)
*Yiming Zhong,Xiaolin Zhang,Ligang Liu,Yao Zhao,Yunchao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarMakeup is a 3D makeup method for virtual avatars, ensuring realistic and consistent makeup effects across expressions and views using a diffusion model and refinement techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian editing methods lack realism and consistency in makeup effects for avatars, failing to maintain identity and detail control.

Method: Leverages a pretrained diffusion model for makeup transfer, employs Coherent Duplication for consistency, and refines details with a Refinement Module.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality and consistency in animations.

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, providing realistic and dynamic makeup for 3D avatars.

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

*Wei Li,Jingyang Zhang,Lihao Liu,Guoan Wang,Junjun He,Yang Chen,Lixu Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation (F²TTA) for medical data, addressing unpredictable domain shifts in fragmented data. It proposes Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT) with Uncertainty-oriented Masking and Parallel Graph Distillation to improve adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt source models to unpredictable domain shifts in medical data fragments, overcoming limitations of existing TTA methods that assume complete domain units.

Method: Proposes I-DiPT with image-invariant and image-specific prompts, enhanced by Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM) and Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD) for knowledge reuse.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in breast cancer and glaucoma classification compared to existing TTA methods.

Conclusion: I-DiPT effectively handles free-form domain fragments, offering a practical solution for medical TTA.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper addresses the slow detection speed of robots by deploying quantized ANNs (MobileNet v1, CNV) on FPGAs using FINN architecture, achieving high success rates and speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots slow down for object detection due to low camera framerates, increasing task execution time. Existing tools like Vitis-AI underutilize FPGA potential.

Method: Deployed three ANNs (MobileNet v1 4-bit, CNV 2-bit, CNV 1-bit) on FPGA's PL using FINN architecture, trained on the RG2C dataset.

Result: MobileNet v1 achieved 98% success rate and 6611 FPS, proving FPGAs can speed up ANNs for attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: FPGAs effectively accelerate ANNs, making them suitable for real-time robotic applications.

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

TL;DR: Proposes HIVE, a human-inspired video editing framework using multimodal narrative understanding to improve coherence and quality of automatic video edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of existing methods that rely on textual cues and neglect visual context, leading to incoherent outputs.

Method: Uses multimodal large language models for character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative summarization, along with scene-level segmentation and subtasks like highlight detection.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, narrowing the gap with human-edited videos.

Conclusion: HIVE effectively leverages multimodal understanding to enhance automatic video editing, demonstrated by superior performance on the DramaAD benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

*Hailong Yan,Junjian Huang,Tingwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGDNet is a zero-shot method for underexposed image restoration, eliminating the need for paired training data and avoiding over-enhancement. It uses decomposition and denoising modules to improve illumination and suppress noise, outperforming 14 unsupervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised methods require impractical paired datasets and often cause over-enhancement. IGDNet addresses these limitations by working without training data or priors.

Method: IGDNet decomposes images into illumination and reflection components using a dense connection network, then enhances illumination with a pixel adaptive correction method. Noise pairs are refined iteratively.

Result: IGDNet achieves PSNR of 20.41dB and SSIM of 0.860dB, outperforming 14 state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on four public datasets.

Conclusion: IGDNet offers a practical, high-performance solution for underexposed image restoration without paired data, demonstrating strong generalization and noise suppression.

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

*Weiwei Duan,Luping Ji,Shengjia Chen,Sicheng Zhu,Jianghong Huang,Mao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme for moving infrared small target detection, reducing reliance on manual annotations and achieving performance close to fully-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for infrared small targets is costly and time-consuming. Weakly supervised methods can reduce annotation needs while maintaining performance.

Method: Uses a pretrained SAM model for potential target mining, integrates contrastive learning for pseudo-label reliability, and employs long-short term motion-aware learning for target motion modeling.

Result: Outperforms early fully-supervised methods and achieves over 90% of SOTA fully-supervised performance on DAUB and ITSDT-15K datasets.

Conclusion: WeCoL is a promising alternative to fully-supervised methods, offering efficiency without significant performance loss.

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh tokenization methods waste network capability with repeated vertex tokens.

Method: Tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each vertex only once, reducing redundancy.

Result: Achieves 50% less redundancy and a 22% compression rate, with superior geometric properties.

Conclusion: Mesh Silksong is effective for intricate mesh generation and geometric integrity.

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisCo Attack, a visual-centric jailbreak method for MLLMs, achieving high toxicity and success rates by dynamically generating contextual dialogue and images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing security vulnerabilities in MLLMs, particularly visual-centric jailbreaks, to highlight risks in real-world deployment.

Method: Proposes VisCo Attack, using four visual-focused strategies, automatic toxicity obfuscation, and semantic refinement to craft effective prompts.

Result: Achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and ASR of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: VisCo Attack demonstrates significant effectiveness in exploiting visual vulnerabilities in MLLMs, urging improved security measures.

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new large-scale dataset, CrowdTrack, is introduced for multi-pedestrian tracking in complex scenarios, addressing limitations of existing datasets and methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack complexity and realism, hindering the development of robust tracking algorithms for challenging scenarios.

Method: The dataset includes 33 videos with 5,185 trajectories, annotated with bounding boxes and unique IDs, focusing on first-person views and real-life complexity.

Result: The dataset enables testing and improving state-of-the-art tracking models, including foundation models, in complex situations.

Conclusion: CrowdTrack provides a valuable resource for advancing multi-pedestrian tracking in realistic, challenging environments.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedFormer is an efficient medical vision transformer addressing task-specific limitations and computational inefficiencies in existing methods. It uses a pyramid scaling structure and Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) for improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision transformer methods for medical image recognition are often task-specific and computationally expensive, limiting their general applicability and efficiency.

Method: MedFormer employs a pyramid scaling structure for versatile feature representation and introduces DSSA for efficient, content-aware attention.

Result: Extensive experiments show MedFormer enhances performance in image classification, semantic segmentation, and lesion detection across various datasets.

Conclusion: MedFormer offers superior generality and efficiency, making it a robust solution for medical image recognition tasks.

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces a supervised contrastive loss with temporally-aware soft targets for polyp counting in colonoscopy, improving clustering robustness and reducing fragmentation rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing automated polyp counting for better procedure reporting and quality control in colonoscopy screening.

Method: Proposes a supervised contrastive loss with temporal awareness and integrates a temporal adjacency constraint for tracklet clustering.

Result: Achieves a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Temporal awareness is crucial for polyp counting, and the proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

*Hyunsoo Son,Jeonghyun Noh,Suemin Jeon,Chaoli Wang,Won-Ki Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MC-INR is a novel neural network framework for encoding multivariate data on unstructured grids, addressing limitations of existing INR methods by combining meta-learning, clustering, and dynamic re-clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INR methods struggle with complex structures, single-variable focus, and structured grid dependence, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: MC-INR integrates meta-learning and clustering, uses residual-based dynamic re-clustering, and employs a branched layer for multivariate data handling.

Result: MC-INR outperforms existing methods in scientific data encoding tasks.

Conclusion: MC-INR effectively addresses the limitations of INR methods, offering improved performance for complex datasets.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

TL;DR: Proposed an automated infrared-RGB labeling pipeline for low-light pedestrian detection, outperforming ground-truth labels in most cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of large public datasets for low-light RGB pedestrian detection, crucial for pedestrian safety in autonomous systems.

Method: 1) Infrared detection, 2) Label transfer to RGB, 3) Training detection models using autolabels.

Result: Models trained on autolabels outperformed ground-truth labels in 6/9 cases for mAP@50 and mAP@50-95 metrics.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively generates labels for low-light conditions, enhancing pedestrian detection performance.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and
mAP@50-95 metrics. The source code for this research is available at

Abstract: India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in
agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and
environmental stress. Early detection and accurate identification of diseases
across different crops are critical for improving yield and ensuring food
security. This paper proposes a deep learning based solution for detecting
multiple diseases in multiple crops, aimed to cover India's diverse

of 17 different crops and 34 different diseases from various available
repositories. Proposed deep learning model is trained on this dataset and
outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops,
diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent
for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to
state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving
the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed
solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize genetic selection in aquaculture by automating shrimp morphological analysis, addressing challenges in view classification and rostrum detection.

Method: Uses modified ResNet-50 for view classification and rostrum detection, VitPose for pose estimation (23 key points), and SVM for pixel-to-centimeter conversion.

Conclusion: IMASHRIMP effectively automates shrimp analysis, enhancing efficiency and sustainability in aquaculture.

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGe-2 advances monocular geometry estimation by recovering metric-scale 3D point maps from single images, refining real data with synthetic labels for better detail, and outperforming prior methods in accuracy and granularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without losing relative geometry accuracy and address noise/errors in real data that reduce fine-grained detail.

Method: Extends MoGe with strategies for metric prediction, refines real data using synthetic labels, and trains on mixed datasets.

Result: Superior performance in relative geometry, metric scale, and fine-grained detail recovery, surpassing previous methods.

Conclusion: MoGe-2 achieves simultaneous capabilities in accuracy, scale, and detail, setting a new benchmark in monocular geometry estimation.

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

*Buzhen Huang,Chen Li,Chongyang Xu,Dongyue Lu,Jinnan Chen,Yangang Wang,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch optimization framework is proposed to reconstruct accurate human interactions in videos by leveraging human appearance, proxemics, and physical constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose estimation methods struggle with visual ambiguities and occlusions in close human interactions, even state-of-the-art models like SAM fail in such scenarios.

Method: A diffusion model learns proxemic behavior and pose priors, integrated into a dual-branch optimization framework with constraints like 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations.

Result: The method achieves accurate interaction estimation in complex environments, validated by benchmarks, and introduces a dataset with pseudo ground-truth annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in close human interactions, offering a robust solution and promoting future research in pose estimation and behavior understanding.

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

### [82] [Parametric shape models for vessels learned from segmentations via differentiable voxelization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02576)
*Alina F. Dima,Suprosanna Shit,Huaqi Qiu,Robbie Holland,Tamara T. Mueller,Fabio Antonio Musio,Kaiyuan Yang,Bjoern Menze,Rickmer Braren,Marcus Makowski,Daniel Rueckert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework integrates voxel, mesh, and parametric representations of vessels using differentiable transformations, enabling automatic shape parameter learning from segmentations without ground-truth parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vessel representations (voxel, mesh, parametric) are used disjointly, limiting their combined potential. The goal is to unify them for seamless manipulation and analysis.

Method: Differentiable voxelization extracts parametric shape models (centerlines and radii via B-splines) from segmentations. Meshes are then differentiably derived from these parameters.

Result: The method accurately captures complex vessel geometries, validated on aortas, aneurysms, and brain vessels.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies multiple vessel representations, enabling high-fidelity mesh manipulation and accurate geometric modeling.

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces $S^2DC$, a self-supervised learning framework for 3D medical images, focusing on structure-aware representations by addressing semantic discrepancy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods ignore anatomical structure variations in 3D medical images, limiting their effectiveness. The goal is to learn structure-aware representations for broader applications.

Method: $S^2DC$ uses optimal transport for semantic discrepancy between patches and neighborhood similarity for semantic consistency at the structural level.

Result: Evaluated on 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3 modalities, $S^2DC$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image self-supervised learning.

Conclusion: $S^2DC$ successfully bridges patch-level and structure-level representations, achieving superior performance in capturing anatomical variations.

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

TL;DR: AuroraLong replaces LLM in MLLMs with a linear RNN for efficient long video understanding, achieving comparable performance to larger Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high computational complexity and memory cost in long video understanding with transformer-based LLMs.

Method: Uses a linear RNN language model with constant-size hidden states and visual token merge for efficiency.

Result: Achieves performance similar to Transformer models with fewer parameters and public data.

Conclusion: Linear RNNs can democratize long video understanding by reducing computational barriers.

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

*Riccardo Gallon,Fabian Schiemenz,Alessandra Menicucci,Eberhard Gill*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting sensor faults in Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) for space missions by creating a synthetic dataset of fault-injected images to train AI-based fault detection algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor faults in VBN can compromise mission reliability, but AI solutions lack representative faulty datasets.

Method: A simulation framework generates synthetic faulty images, analyzing fault causes, effects, and mitigation strategies.

Result: A dataset of fault-injected images is created to aid AI-based fault detection.

Conclusion: The synthetic dataset enables robust AI training for fault detection in VBN, enhancing mission reliability.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Holmes-Set, a dataset for AI-generated image (AIGI) detection, and Holmes Pipeline, a training framework for MLLMs, to address lack of human-verifiable explanations and generalization in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misuse of realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) threatens public information security, and current detection methods lack explainability and generalization.

Method: Proposes Holmes-Set (Holmes-SFTSet and Holmes-DPOSet) and Holmes Pipeline, a three-stage training framework for MLLMs, with a collaborative decoding strategy for inference.

Result: AIGI-Holmes model shows effectiveness in experiments on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach improves AIGI detection with human-verifiable explanations and better generalization.

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

TL;DR: A novel framework combines deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a diffusion model (DM) image prior into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing strategies (Plug-and-Play and specialized conditional DMs) by integrating deep unfolding and model distillation for improved posterior sampling.

Method: Unfolds a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (LATINO Langevin sampler) and applies model distillation to create a few-step conditional model.

Result: Achieves excellent accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while maintaining flexibility.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between flexibility and accuracy in DM-based Bayesian computational imaging.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT is a framework to mitigate overfitting in personalized diffusion models by adaptive training strategies and representation regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and text alignment degradation in personalizing diffusion models with limited data.

Method: APT includes Adaptive Training Adjustment, Representation Stabilization, and Attention Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation.

Result: APT effectively reduces overfitting, preserves prior knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating diverse images with limited data.

Conclusion: APT offers a robust solution for personalizing diffusion models while maintaining semantic coherence and prior knowledge.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CanonSwap is a video face-swapping framework that decouples motion and appearance to improve identity transfer and preserve dynamic facial attributes. It outperforms existing methods in quality, consistency, and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video face-swapping methods struggle with maintaining dynamic facial attributes (e.g., expressions, poses) while transferring identity, due to the coupling of appearance and motion.

Method: CanonSwap decouples motion and appearance, modifies identity in a canonical space, and reintegrates features. It includes a Partial Identity Modulation module and fine-grained synchronization metrics.

Result: CanonSwap achieves superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and identity preservation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of video face swapping by decoupling motion and appearance, leading to more realistic and consistent results.

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

TL;DR: SIU3R is an alignment-free framework for simultaneous 3D reconstruction and understanding from unposed images, using pixel-aligned 3D representation and unified queries, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D-to-3D feature alignment methods limit 3D understanding and lose semantic information, prompting the need for an alignment-free approach.

Method: SIU3R uses pixel-aligned 3D representation and unified learnable queries to bridge reconstruction and understanding tasks, with lightweight modules for task interaction.

Result: SIU3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, understanding, and their simultaneous execution.

Conclusion: The alignment-free framework and mutual benefit designs of SIU3R effectively enhance 3D understanding and reconstruction.

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniMC, a DiT-based framework for unified controllable multi-class image generation, and HAIG-2.9M, a dataset for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing keypoint-guided models struggle with non-rigid objects and overlapping instances due to method limitations and dataset scarcity.

Method: UniMC integrates instance- and keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, while HAIG-2.9M provides a large, annotated dataset for humans and animals.

Result: UniMC and HAIG-2.9M show effectiveness in handling occlusions and multi-class scenarios, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset advance keypoint-guided image generation, particularly for complex scenarios involving humans and animals.

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

*Yuxuan Wang,Tianwei Cao,Huayu Zhang,Zhongjiang He,Kongming Liang,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairHuman improves human image generation by balancing global and local objectives using multi-objective fine-tuning and MPD criterion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating detailed human images (e.g., faces, hands) is challenging due to insufficient local supervision in training.

Method: Proposes FairHuman with three objectives: global (default diffusion), local (hands, faces), and MPD-guided optimization.

Result: Significant improvement in local detail generation while maintaining overall quality.

Conclusion: FairHuman effectively enhances human image generation across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

*Mélanie Gaillochet,Mehrdad Noori,Sahar Dastani,Christian Desrosiers,Hervé Lombaert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combines foundation models with weakly supervised segmentation, automating prompt generation using bounding box annotations to reduce annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-wise annotations are costly in medical imaging; weakly supervised methods using bounding boxes offer a practical alternative.

Method: The approach automates prompt generation for foundation models using bounding box annotations, integrating constraints and pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves an average Dice score of 84.90%, outperforming fully and weakly supervised methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces annotation burden while maintaining high segmentation performance.

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DexVLG is a vision-language-grasp model for dexterous grasp prediction using single-view RGBD input, trained on a large dataset (DexGraspNet 3.0) and achieving strong zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research exists on functional grasping with large models for dexterous hands, despite the rise of vision-language-action systems.

Method: Generates a dataset of 170M grasp poses (DexGraspNet 3.0) and trains a VLM with flow-matching-based pose head for instruction-aligned grasps.

Result: Achieves 76% zero-shot success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation, with real-world applicability.

Conclusion: DexVLG demonstrates effective generalization and performance for dexterous grasp prediction, bridging a gap in current research.

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

*Alex Colagrande,Paul Caillon,Eva Feillet,Alexandre Allauzen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANO introduces a linear-complexity attention mechanism inspired by n-body simulations, rivaling ViT and Swin Transformer in performance while reducing resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers have quadratic complexity, making them impractical for high-resolution inputs. Patchification or downsampling techniques often lose fine details.

Method: MANO casts attention as an interaction problem between grid points, using distance-based multiscale computation to achieve linear complexity.

Result: MANO matches state-of-the-art models (ViT, Swin) in tasks like image classification and Darcy flows, with significantly lower runtime and memory usage.

Conclusion: MANO offers a scalable, efficient alternative to standard Transformers without sacrificing performance, with open-sourced code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

*Mingxin Liu,Peiyuan Zhang,Yuan Liu,Wei Zhang,Yue Zhou,Ning Liao,Ziyang Gong,Junwei Luo,Zhirui Wang,Yi Yu,Xue Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework to reduce annotation costs while maintaining performance, outperforming weakly supervised methods and matching semi-supervised ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High annotation costs for oriented object detection datasets drive the need for cost-effective solutions.

Method: Introduces PWOOD framework, OS-Student model for learning with weak annotations, and CPF strategy for threshold sensitivity reduction.

Result: PWOOD performs comparably or better than semi-supervised methods on DOTA and DIOR datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a low-cost, high-performance alternative for oriented object detection.

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

*Danrong Zhang,Huili Huang,N. Simrill Smith,Nimisha Roy,J. David Frost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semantic segmentation approach for assessing earthquake damage severity in social media images, improving objectivity and precision over traditional classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional damage severity assessment methods are subjective and lack granularity. This study aims to provide a more objective and nuanced analysis of damage.

Method: Constructs a segmented damage severity dataset (undamaged, damaged, debris), fine-tunes a SegFormer model for segmentation, and introduces a new scoring system accounting for varying damage degrees and depth.

Result: The approach enables more objective and comprehensive quantification of damage severity in social media images.

Conclusion: The method enhances disaster reconnaissance by providing precise damage assessments, aiding targeted response efforts post-earthquake.

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

*Liheng Zhang,Lexi Pang,Hang Ye,Xiaoxuan Ma,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A flexible feature injection framework for text-to-image diffusion models improves structural alignment and visual quality without training, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature injection methods for conditional image generation suffer from structural misalignment and artifacts, especially with non-RGB conditions.

Method: Proposes a decoupled feature injection framework with a structure-rich module, appearance-rich prompting, and restart refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conditioning scenarios with better structural and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The framework enables training-free, high-quality generation with improved structural and appearance control.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

*Miguel Espinosa,Chenhongyi Yang,Linus Ericsson,Steven McDonagh,Elliot J. Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to reduce the manual effort in image segmentation by leveraging reference images and semantic priors from foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the burden of manual prompts in segmentation models like SAM, the work explores using reference images and semantic priors for automatic segmentation.

Method: A multi-stage, training-free approach involving memory bank construction, representation aggregation, and semantic-aware feature matching.

Result: Achieves 36.8% nAP on COCO FSOD, 71.2% nAP50 on PASCAL VOC Few-Shot, and 22.4% nAP on Cross-Domain FSOD, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively automates segmentation using reference images and semantic priors, setting new benchmarks in few-shot and cross-domain tasks.

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation
metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),
PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free
approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperGaussians extend 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-quality animatable face avatars, improving expressivity and handling complex deformations and details better than 3DGS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating detailed, animatable face avatars from monocular videos is challenging, with current methods struggling with nonlinear deformations and fine details.

Method: Introduces HyperGaussians, high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, with a learnable local embedding and an 'inverse covariance trick' for efficient computation.

Result: HyperGaussians outperform 3DGS in rendering high-frequency details like eyeglasses, teeth, and complex facial movements, as shown on 19 subjects from 4 datasets.

Conclusion: HyperGaussians offer a more expressive and efficient solution for animatable face avatars, enhancing visual quality and performance.

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

TL;DR: LangScene-X introduces a generative framework for 3D scene reconstruction and understanding from sparse views, using a TriMap video diffusion model and Language Quantized Compressor (LQC) for cross-scene generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on dense-view reconstruction, leading to artifacts and poor semantics with limited views. LangScene-X aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Uses a TriMap video diffusion model for generating RGBs, normals, and segmentation maps from sparse inputs, and an LQC for encoding language embeddings without per-scene retraining.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quality and generalizability on real-world data.

Conclusion: LangScene-X effectively unifies and generates 3D multi-modality information, enabling robust open-vocabulary scene understanding from sparse views.

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multimodal HAR, such as cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality contributions.

Method: Uses a dual-path (ResNet and DenseNet) feature extraction, multi-stage contrastive learning, and confidence-driven gradient modulation.

Result: Validated via ablation studies and outperforms on four public benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DCDP-HAR effectively tackles HAR challenges with its novel components.

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes USAD, a multi-attention interaction approach for HAR, addressing data scarcity, feature extraction, and lightweight device performance with unsupervised augmentation and spatio-temporal attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAR faces challenges like scarce labeled data, poor feature extraction, and suboptimal performance on lightweight devices.

Method: Uses unsupervised diffusion for data augmentation, a multi-branch spatio-temporal network with attention, and adaptive multi-loss fusion.

Result: Achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% on WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: USAD is efficient, feasible for embedded devices, and significantly improves HAR performance.

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

TL;DR: AnyI2V is a training-free framework for animating conditional images with user-defined motion, supporting diverse modalities and flexible editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations in T2V and I2V synthesis, such as lack of spatial control in T2V and restricted editability in I2V.

Method: Proposes AnyI2V, a framework that animates conditional images with motion trajectories, supports mixed inputs, and enables style transfer.

Result: Achieves superior performance in spatial- and motion-controlled video generation, with flexibility in modalities and editing.

Conclusion: AnyI2V offers a versatile solution for video generation, addressing key challenges in dynamic motion and spatial constraints.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training MLLMs with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data improves adaptation to specialized vision tasks, but CoT data often contains factual errors. The proposed Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) method adds grounding information to CoT data, enhancing reasoning faithfulness and performance in data-limited regimes.

Motivation: MLLMs struggle with specialized vision tasks due to dataset mismatches. CoT data helps but suffers from factual errors, limiting its effectiveness.

Method: Propose GCoT, a bootstrapping-based approach that injects grounding (bounding boxes) into CoT data to improve reasoning faithfulness.

Result: GCoT significantly outperforms fine-tuning and distillation on five specialized vision tasks (charts, tables, receipts, reports).

Conclusion: GCoT enhances MLLM adaptation to specialized tasks by addressing CoT data errors, proving effective in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

TL;DR: EasyCache is a training-free framework that accelerates video diffusion models by reusing computed transformation vectors, reducing inference time by 2.1-3.3× while improving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow inference speeds and high computational costs of video generation models limit their adoption. EasyCache aims to address this bottleneck for broader use.

Method: Introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism to avoid redundant computations during inference, requiring no offline profiling or tuning.

Result: Achieves 2.1-3.3× faster inference and up to 36% PSNR improvement over baselines, maintaining high visual fidelity.

Conclusion: EasyCache is an efficient, accessible solution for high-quality video generation in research and practical applications.

Abstract: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original
baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36%
PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes
our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video
generation in both research and practical applications. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteReality converts RGB-D scans into compact, interactive 3D virtual replicas with realism and key graphics features like object individuality, articulation, and physics-based interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create realistic and interactive 3D virtual replicas from RGB-D scans for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins.

Method: Uses scene understanding, structured scene graphs, 3D model retrieval, material painting, and simulation engine integration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on Scan2CAD and robust material transfer under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: LiteReality produces compact, editable, and realistic 3D scenes compatible with standard graphics pipelines.

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefTok is a reference-based tokenization method for videos that outperforms state-of-the-art models by capturing temporal dynamics and improving metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video models struggle with temporal redundancy and dependencies, treating frames independently. RefTok aims to address this by leveraging reference frames.

Method: RefTok encodes and decodes frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame, preserving motion continuity and object appearance.

Result: RefTok outperforms Cosmos and MAGVIT across 4 datasets, improving metrics by 36.7%. It also enhances video generation, surpassing MAGVIT-L by 27.9%.

Conclusion: RefTok effectively handles temporal redundancy and dependencies, setting a new benchmark for video tokenization and generation.

Abstract: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

TL;DR: Point3R introduces an online framework for dense 3D scene reconstruction using explicit spatial pointer memory to avoid information loss in earlier frames, achieving competitive performance with low training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dense 3D reconstruction rely on implicit memory, which is limited in capacity and prone to losing information from earlier frames. Point3R addresses this by using explicit spatial pointer memory.

Method: Point3R maintains an explicit spatial pointer memory linked to the 3D scene structure. It uses 3D hierarchical position embedding and a fusion mechanism to integrate new observations efficiently.

Result: The method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs.

Conclusion: Point3R offers an effective solution for dense streaming 3D reconstruction by leveraging explicit memory and efficient fusion, outperforming implicit memory-based approaches.

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

TL;DR: STELLA is a self-evolving AI agent for biomedical research, outperforming existing models by dynamically improving its tools and reasoning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmented and rapidly growing biomedical research landscape requires adaptable AI solutions beyond static toolsets.

Method: STELLA uses a multi-agent architecture with an evolving Template Library and dynamic Tool Ocean, autonomously integrating new tools and learning from experience.

Result: STELLA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on biomedical benchmarks (e.g., 26% on Humanity's Last Exam, 54% on LAB-Bench: DBQA, 63% on LAB-Bench: LitQA), improving with experience.

Conclusion: STELLA advances AI systems by enabling dynamic learning and scalability, accelerating biomedical discovery.

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

*Kenneth Payne,Baptiste Alloui-Cros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs demonstrate strategic intelligence in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, showing competitive performance and distinct strategic behaviors across models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can reason about goals in competitive settings, using the IPD as a model for decision-making.

Method: Conducted evolutionary IPD tournaments with canonical strategies and LLM agents, varying termination probabilities to introduce complexity.

Result: LLMs were highly competitive, with distinct strategic behaviors: Gemini (ruthless), OpenAI (cooperative), and Claude (forgiving). Models actively reasoned about time horizons and opponent strategies.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit strategic intelligence, connecting game theory with machine psychology for nuanced algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

*Jiajie Jin,Xiaoxi Li,Guanting Dong,Yuyao Zhang,Yutao Zhu,Yang Zhao,Hongjin Qian,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiRA introduces a hierarchical framework for complex search tasks, separating strategic planning from specialized execution to improve efficiency and answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG pipelines struggle with deep reasoning and knowledge synthesis, and current reasoning-based approaches inefficiently combine planning and execution.

Method: HiRA decomposes tasks into subtasks, assigns them to domain-specific agents with external tools, and coordinates results through structured integration.

Result: HiRA outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based systems in answer quality and efficiency on complex benchmarks.

Conclusion: Decoupling planning and execution enhances performance in multi-step information seeking tasks.

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepHint is a new RLVR algorithm using multi-level stepwise hints to improve LLMs' reasoning, addressing near-miss rewards and exploration stagnation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods struggle with near-miss rewards and exploration stagnation, limiting training efficiency and reasoning ability.

Method: StepHint generates reasoning chains from stronger models, partitions them into steps, and provides multi-level hints to guide exploration.

Result: StepHint outperforms other RLVR methods on six mathematical benchmarks and shows better generalization on out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: StepHint effectively addresses RLVR challenges, enhancing reasoning and exploration in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for treating movement as a primary modeling target in AI, highlighting its structured, interpretable nature and cross-domain relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement is fundamental in biological systems but often overlooked in AI. The paper argues for its importance in understanding behavior and enabling interaction across domains.

Method: Proposes modeling movement as a structured, low-dimensional modality, leveraging shared physical constraints and conserved dynamics.

Result: Movement data offers compact, interpretable representations, making it tractable for AI modeling and generalization.

Conclusion: Movement should be central to AI, serving as a foundation for generative modeling, control, and cross-species behavior understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing catastrophic forgetting in LALMs when augmenting LLMs with auditory capabilities, and enabling zero-shot generalization without task-specific tuning.

Method: Proposes DeSTA, a self-generated cross-modal alignment strategy where the LLM generates its own training targets, and constructs DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on audio-language benchmarks like Dynamic-SUPERB and MMAU, outperforming other data construction strategies.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of careful data construction for robust LALMs and provides insights for general-purpose LALM development.

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

TL;DR: An efficient real-time method for image-based lighting of glints, using environment map filtering and hierarchical sampling, validated for accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of rendering sparkling or glittering materials under dynamic lighting conditions in real-time applications.

Method: Uses environment map filtering with homogeneous regions and hierarchical sampling via a dual-gated Gaussian approximation.

Result: Close to ground-truth renderings with stable performance and minimal overhead, though requiring twice the memory for prefiltered maps.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively approximates glint rendering in real-time, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Image-based lighting is a widely used technique to reproduce shading under
real-world lighting conditions, especially in real-time rendering applications.
A particularly challenging scenario involves materials exhibiting a sparkling
or glittering appearance, caused by discrete microfacets scattered across their
surface. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based
lighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment
maps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area
light illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques.
Crucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be
executed on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is
partitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the
corresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we
obtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each
region. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically
sample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian
approximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time
approximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material
properties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable
performance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single
directional light. Compared to rendering smooth materials without glints, our
approach requires twice as much memory to store the prefiltered environment
map.

TL;DR: tubuleTracker is a fast, objective tool for analyzing endothelial network architecture and maturity, outperforming manual and ImageJ methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual and ImageJ-based analysis of endothelial cell networks are time-consuming, subjective, and inaccurate, especially for complex networks.

Method: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured, and images were analyzed manually, with ImageJ, and tubuleTracker. Metrics included tubule count, length, node count, area, and circularity.

Result: tubuleTracker was significantly faster and more consistent than manual and ImageJ methods. Vessel circularity effectively captured angiogenesis maturity.

Conclusion: tubuleTracker is a superior tool for rapid, objective analysis of endothelial networks and is available as free shareware.

Abstract: Background: In vitro endothelial cell culture is widely used to study
angiogenesis. Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed
manually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like
ImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as
endothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may
not fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed
tubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture
and maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired
using phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three
independent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics
included tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel
circularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis
maturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image
differed significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker
(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count
(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node
count (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across
angiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,
and circularity (all p<0.0001). Conclusions: tubuleTracker was faster and more
consistent than both manual and ImageJ-based analysis. Vessel circularity
proved especially effective in capturing angiogenesis maturity. tubuleTracker
is available as free shareware for the biomedical research community.

TL;DR: A deep learning model, CineMyoPS, segments myocardial scars and edema from cine CMR images without contrast agents, using motion and anatomy features with a consistency loss and time-series aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Myocardial infarction (MI) risk assessment requires multi-sequence CMR imaging, which is time-consuming and involves contrast agents. Cine CMR is faster and contrast-free but lacks direct pathology visualization.

Method: CineMyoPS uses an end-to-end deep neural network to extract motion and anatomy features from cine CMR, employs a consistency loss for joint learning, and integrates features across the cardiac cycle with time-series aggregation.

Result: CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in segmenting myocardial pathologies, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation on a multi-center dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables accurate myocardial pathology segmentation from cine CMR alone, offering a faster, contrast-free alternative to traditional multi-sequence CMR.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are
essential for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment. Although
combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful,
acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to
the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free
imaging technique that can visualize both motion and structural abnormalities
of the myocardium induced by acute MI. Therefore, we present a new end-to-end
deep neural network, referred to as CineMyoPS, to segment myocardial
pathologies, \ie scars and edema, solely from cine CMR images. Specifically,
CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given
the interdependence between these features, we design a consistency loss
(resembling the co-training strategy) to facilitate their joint learning.
Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate
MI-related features across the cardiac cycle, thereby enhancing segmentation
accuracy for myocardial pathologies. Experimental results on a multi-center
dataset demonstrate that CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in myocardial
pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation.

### [119] [A robust and versatile deep learning model for prediction of the arterial input function in dynamic small animal $\left[^{18}\text{F}\right]$FDG PET imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02367)
*Christian Salomonsen,Luigi Tommaso Luppino,Fredrik Aspheim,Kristoffer Wickstrøm,Elisabeth Wetzer,Michael Kampffmeyer,Rodrigo Berzaghi,Rune Sundset,Robert Jenssen,Samuel Kuttner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning model (FC-DLIF) predicts arterial input functions from PET imaging, eliminating invasive blood sampling in small-animal studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arterial blood sampling in small animals is invasive and terminal, hindering longitudinal studies. Non-invasive alternatives are needed.

Method: FC-DLIF uses spatial and temporal feature extraction from PET sequences to predict input functions. Evaluated on [$^{18}$F]FDG, [$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA data.

Result: FC-DLIF reliably predicts input functions, handles temporal shifts and truncated scans, but fails with untrained radiotracers.

Conclusion: FC-DLIF offers a robust, non-invasive alternative to blood sampling, suitable for dynamic PET studies.

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal
in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate
kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally
achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small
animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,
precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully
convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions
directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling
in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial
feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,
extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a
temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The
proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood
curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model
applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected
using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The
model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate
shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts
the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.
Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function
even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF
from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not
represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers
a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving
robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.

*Zhurong Chen,Jinhua Chen,Wei Zhuo,Wufeng Xue,Dong Ni*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel framework reconstructs personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices, improving LV and RV volume estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of 2D and 3D ultrasound imaging (low resolution, manual delineation) for accurate clinical parameter estimation.

Method: A 3D reconstruction pipeline alternates between optimizing 2D slice pose estimation and 3D integration using an implicit neural network.

Result: Significant improvement in LV volume estimation (1.98% error vs. 20.24%) and breakthrough RV volume estimation (5.75% error).

Conclusion: The framework enables personalized 3D heart analysis from 2D echo, offering high clinical potential.

Abstract: Echocardiography (echo) plays an indispensable role in the clinical practice
of heart diseases. However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only
two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making
it challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical
parameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging
provides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low
spatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation.
  To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for
reconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are
frequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction
pipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose
estimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an
implicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into
a personalized 3D heart model.
  We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the
reconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume
estimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\% VS. 20.24\%). In
addition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important
breakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of
5.75\% ). This study provides a new way for personalized 3D structure and
function analysis from cardiac ultrasound and is of great potential in clinical
practice.

TL;DR: MEGANet-W, a wavelet-driven edge-guided network, improves colorectal polyp segmentation by integrating Haar wavelet edge maps without extra parameters, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weak and low-contrast boundaries in colorectal polyp images hinder automated segmentation accuracy, and current methods either blur edges or rely on ineffective handcrafted filters.

Method: Proposes MEGANet-W with a two-level Haar wavelet head for edge extraction and Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (WEGA) modules to fuse wavelet cues with semantic features.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on five datasets, improving mIoU by 2.3% and mDice by 1.2% without additional parameters.

Conclusion: MEGANet-W effectively addresses edge detail loss in polyp segmentation, offering a parameter-free solution with superior performance.

Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal
cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated
accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on
handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We
propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects
directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to
recalibrate semantic features. Our two main contributions are: (1) a two-level
Haar wavelet head for multi orientation edge extraction; and (2) Wavelet Edge
Guided Attention (WEGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with reverse and input
branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANetW consistently outperforms
existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while
introducing no additional learnable parameters.

TL;DR: MISCGrasp is a volumetric grasping method using multi-scale feature extraction and contrastive learning for adaptive robotic grasping, outperforming baselines in decluttering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in robotic grasping for objects with varying shapes and sizes.

Method: Integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive learning, using Insight and Empower Transformers for feature interaction and enhancement.

Result: Outperforms baseline and variant methods in simulated and real-world tabletop decluttering tasks.

Conclusion: MISCGrasp effectively balances fine geometric details and overall structures, improving grasping adaptability.

Abstract: Robotic grasping faces challenges in adapting to objects with varying shapes
and sizes. In this paper, we introduce MISCGrasp, a volumetric grasping method
that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive feature
enhancement for self-adaptive grasping. We propose a query-based interaction
between high-level and low-level features through the Insight Transformer,
while the Empower Transformer selectively attends to the highest-level
features, which synergistically strikes a balance between focusing on fine
geometric details and overall geometric structures. Furthermore, MISCGrasp
utilizes multi-scale contrastive learning to exploit similarities among
positive grasp samples, ensuring consistency across multi-scale features.
Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate
that MISCGrasp outperforms baseline and variant methods in tabletop
decluttering tasks. More details are available at https://miscgrasp.github.io/.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MultiGen integrates generative models into physics simulators for multisensory simulation, enabling zero-shot transfer to real-world tasks like robot pouring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning multimodal policies at scale is challenging, especially for non-visual modalities like sound, which are hard to simulate.

Method: MultiGen combines large-scale generative models with physics simulators to synthesize realistic audio from simulation video, enabling training on audiovisual data without real-world input.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrates zero-shot transfer to real-world pouring tasks with novel containers and liquids.

Conclusion: Generative modeling can simulate hard-to-model modalities and bridge the multimodal sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the
real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains
challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has
benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be
notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has
succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still
largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing
MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into
traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase
our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on
multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation
video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without
any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world
pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of
generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the
multimodal sim-to-real gap.

*Zongpu Zhang,Pranab Dash,Y. Charlie Hu,Qiang Xu,Jian Li,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: The paper addresses energy inefficiency in deploying LLMs on mobile devices due to uncoordinated CPU, GPU, and memory governors, proposing FUSE, a unified governor, to optimize energy use and reduce latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high energy demand and inefficiency of current LLM frameworks on mobile devices, caused by independent CPU, GPU, and memory governors, motivate the need for a unified solution.

Method: The study measures energy inefficiency, analyzes governor interplay, and designs FUSE, an energy-aware governor for coordinated frequency optimization.

Result: FUSE reduces time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and 25.4%-36.8% with the same energy-per-token.

Conclusion: FUSE effectively improves energy efficiency and reduces latency for LLM inference on mobile devices.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various
applications and services running on billions of mobile devices. However,
deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge
due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. While
current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU,
and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors
for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate
independently and are oblivious of each other. Motivated by the above
observation, in this work, we first measure the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM
framework consisting of various LLM models on mobile phones which showed the
triplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding
latency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies
with the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths.
Second, we conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate
interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency
in LLM inference. Finally, based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified
energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on
mobile devices. Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the
time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and
25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM
models.

*Anmol Singhal,Travis Breaux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: An automated approach using textual entailment and in-context learning generates executable Python representations of legal text, improving compliance metadata extraction without heavy manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small organizations struggle with legal compliance due to resource constraints. Existing methods for extracting legal metadata are limited by manual efforts and poor generalization.

Method: Uses textual entailment and in-context learning to create a Python-based metamodel, capturing structural and semantic metadata and their relationships.

Result: Achieves 89.4% test case pass rate and precision/recall of 82.2/88.7 on U.S. state data breach laws.

Conclusion: The approach reduces manual labeling needs and enhances generalization, offering a scalable solution for legal compliance.

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

TL;DR: The paper explores using GPT-4o to generate follow-up questions in requirements elicitation interviews, showing LLM-generated questions match or outperform human-authored ones in clarity, relevancy, and informativeness, especially when guided by common interviewer mistakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like domain unfamiliarity and cognitive load in real-time interview question formulation during requirements elicitation.

Method: Investigates GPT-4o for generating follow-up questions, using a framework of common interviewer mistakes and interviewee speech. Conducts two controlled experiments comparing LLM-generated and human-authored questions.

Result: LLM-generated questions are no worse than human-authored ones in clarity, relevancy, and informativeness, and outperform when guided by mistake types.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4o can enhance the quality and ease of requirements elicitation interviews in real time.

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.

TL;DR: FinAI-BERT, a transformer-based model, achieves high accuracy in classifying AI-related sentences in financial texts, outperforming traditional methods and ensuring interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for tools to detect AI-related disclosures in financial filings is growing, but existing methods lack granularity and robustness.

Method: FinAI-BERT, a domain-adapted transformer model, was fine-tuned on a manually curated dataset of 1,586 sentences from U.S. bank reports.

Result: The model achieved 99.37% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.993, surpassing traditional baselines, with confirmed interpretability and robustness.

Conclusion: FinAI-BERT advances financial NLP by providing a scalable, transparent solution for monitoring AI diffusion in financial institutions.

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services has
prompted growing demand for tools that can systematically detect AI-related
disclosures in corporate filings. While prior approaches often rely on keyword
expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity,
interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a
domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related
content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned
on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669
annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect
classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993),
outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based
token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the
model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal
samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing
fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures.
Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts,
regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI
across financial institutions.

TL;DR: The paper examines ASV embeddings' limitations in capturing voice identity, focusing on static features while neglecting dynamics like rhythm. It proposes U3D to address this gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve how voice identity is represented in generative speech systems, particularly addressing the shortcomings of ASV embeddings.

Method: Analyzes ASV embeddings, identifies their focus on static features, and introduces U3D to evaluate dynamic rhythm patterns.

Result: ASV embeddings prioritize static features (timbre, pitch) over dynamic ones (rhythm). U3D is proposed to fill this gap.

Conclusion: The work highlights limitations in current voice identity modeling and offers U3D as a solution, contributing to better speaker identity assessment in voice cloning.

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers in audio self-supervised learning often allocate attention to irrelevant information, reducing discriminative ability.

Method: Proposes a differential attention mechanism using dual-softmax operations and tuned differential coefficients.

Result: ASDA achieves SOTA performance: 49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K, 98.3% accuracy on SPC-2, and 96.1% accuracy on ESC-50.

Conclusion: ASDA effectively improves attention allocation in audio tasks, enabling broader applications.

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in research on multimodal approaches for misinformation detection during elections and crises.

Method: Analyzed 1,529 tweets using early fusion of text, images, and social features, enriched with object detection and OCR.

Result: Multimodal models improved classification by 15% over unimodal and 5% over bimodal models. Propagation patterns of misinformation were also analyzed.

Conclusion: Multimodal feature combinations enhance misinformation detection, and understanding propagation patterns aids in combating misinformation.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks general-purpose LLMs against a proprietary hiring model (Match Score), showing Match Score's superior accuracy and fairness in candidate-job matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about accuracy and bias in using LLMs for hiring by comparing them with a domain-specific model.

Method: Evaluated predictive accuracy (ROC AUC, Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio across demographic groups) on 10,000 candidate-job pairs.

Result: Match Score outperformed LLMs in accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77) and fairness (minimum race-wise impact ratio 0.957 vs 0.809 for LLMs).

Conclusion: Domain-specific models with bias auditing are crucial for high-stakes tasks like hiring, as they can achieve both accuracy and fairness.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

### [134] [OmniDraft: A Cross-vocabulary, Online Adaptive Drafter for On-device Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02659)
*Ramchalam Kinattinkara Ramakrishnan,Zhaocong Yuan,Shaojie Zhuo,Chen Feng,Yicheng Lin,Chenzheng Su,Xiaopeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniDraft is a unified framework enabling a single draft model to work with any target model, addressing cross-vocabulary mismatches and improving decoding speed via adaptive techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in online deployment include incompatible draft-target models and latency expectations. OmniDraft aims to solve these by offering a versatile, adaptive solution.

Method: Uses an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning and adaptive drafting techniques to enhance compatibility and speed.

Result: OmniDraft allows a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models, achieving 1.5-2x speedup in decoding.

Conclusion: OmniDraft is effective for on-device LLM applications, promoting the 'one drafter for all' paradigm.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

### [135] [ExPO: Unlocking Hard Reasoning with Self-Explanation-Guided Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02834)
*Ruiyang Zhou,Shuozhe Li,Amy Zhang,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExPO is a framework for improving reasoning in language models by generating effective positive samples, outperforming expert-based methods in challenging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-style post-training methods refine existing knowledge but fail to solve problems where the model initially struggles, especially in early-stage training and challenging reasoning tasks.

Method: ExPO generates positive samples by conditioning on ground-truth answers, ensuring they align with the model's policy and improve correctness.

Result: ExPO enhances learning efficiency and performance, particularly in difficult tasks like MATH level-5, where it surpasses expert-based methods.

Conclusion: ExPO addresses limitations of existing methods by enabling effective exploration and alignment with the model's policy, improving reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

*Xiao Li,Liangji Zhu,Anand Rangarajan,Sanjay Ranka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent diffusion framework combines a variational autoencoder with a conditional diffusion model for efficient data compression, achieving high compression ratios and better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models lack controllability and reconstruction accuracy for practical data compression applications.

Method: Proposes a latent diffusion framework using keyframes in latent space and generative interpolation for reconstruction.

Result: Achieves up to 10x higher compression ratios than SZ3 and 63% better performance than learning-based methods.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the gap in generative models for practical data compression with high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

*Alif Ashrafee,Jedrzej Kozal,Michal Wozniak,Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR) for continual learning under concept drift, outperforming Full Relearning (FR) with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional continual learning methods ignore dynamic data streams with concept drift, requiring stability and rapid adaptation.

Method: Proposes AMR, a lightweight method that updates the replay buffer with drift-aware adaptation, reducing annotation and computational costs.

Result: AMR matches FR's performance while significantly reducing labeled data and computation needs, validated on concept-drift variants of standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: AMR is a scalable solution for non-stationary continual learning, balancing stability and plasticity effectively.

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

*Hazal Mogultay Ozcan,Sinan Kalkan,Fatos T. Yarman-Vural*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L-VAE is a novel model that learns disentangled representations and hyperparameters of the cost function, improving upon β-VAE by dynamically balancing reconstruction and disentanglement losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of β-VAE, which requires empirical adjustment of hyperparameters, by learning the trade-off between reconstruction and disentanglement losses automatically.

Method: L-VAE learns the weights of loss terms and model parameters concurrently, adding a regularization term to avoid bias.

Result: L-VAE achieves effective balance between reconstruction and disentanglement, outperforming or matching other models on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: L-VAE is a robust model for disentangling representations, validated by quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

*Harry Cheng,Ming-Hui Liu,Yangyang Guo,Tianyi Wang,Liqiang Nie,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAID, a framework to address the trade-off between fairness and generalization in deepfake detection by controlling confounders and using demographic-aware interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the conflicting objectives of generalization to unseen manipulations and demographic fairness in deepfake detection.

Method: Proposes DAID, a plug-and-play framework with demographic-aware data rebalancing and demographic-agnostic feature aggregation.

Result: DAID outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in fairness and generalization across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: DAID effectively balances fairness and generalization, validated by its superior performance.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: A method using Differentially Private (DP) generative models for decentralized medical imaging training, improving privacy, scalability, and efficiency over traditional Federated Learning (FL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and privacy concerns in medical imaging by leveraging DP generative models for decentralized training.

Method: Propose a Differentially Private Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware data distribution, reducing redundancy and computational costs.

Result: Outperforms traditional FL classifiers, enhances privacy and scalability, and produces higher-fidelity embeddings with fewer parameters than DP-CGAN.

Conclusion: The DP-CVAE method offers a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for diverse downstream tasks in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

TL;DR: HyFairCRS is a novel framework for fair conversational recommender systems, addressing dynamic unfairness by capturing diverse user interests via hypergraph contrastive learning and ensuring fair item predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unfairness in recommender systems worsens over time, causing issues like the Matthew effect and filter bubbles. Existing methods focus on static contexts, leaving dynamic fairness in conversational systems unaddressed.

Method: HyFairCRS uses hypergraph contrastive learning to capture diverse user interests and applies them in dynamic conversations for fair item predictions.

Result: Experiments on two datasets show HyFairCRS achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing unfairness.

Conclusion: HyFairCRS effectively promotes fairness in dynamic conversational recommender systems by leveraging multi-interest diversity and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs, finding they can encode messages and reasoning under certain conditions but struggle to evade well-designed monitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the risks posed by LLMs using steganography to evade monitoring.

Method: Evaluated two types of steganography: encoded messages and encoded reasoning, testing models under standard and additional affordances.

Result: Current LLMs show nascent steganographic capabilities but struggle to bypass monitors without extra affordances. Early signs of encoded reasoning were observed.

Conclusion: While current LLMs' steganography is limited, future advancements could pose greater risks to monitoring systems.

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

### [143] [Seeing Through Green: Text-Based Classification and the Firm's Returns from Green Patents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02287)
*Lapo Santarlasci,Armando Rungi,Antonio Zinilli*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper uses NLP to identify 'true' green patents from existing classifications, finding they constitute 20% of previously labeled green patents. It also links these patents to firm-level financial benefits in the EU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine green patent classification and assess their economic impact, addressing gaps in prior literature.

Method: Trains a neural network to expand a baseline dictionary using vector representations of environmental tech terms, then analyzes patent citations and firm financial data.

Result: True green patents make up 20% of prior classifications, are cited 1% less, and correlate with higher sales, market share, and productivity. High-novelty patents also boost profits.

Conclusion: Text-based patent classification is crucial for policymaking, as true green patents demonstrate significant economic benefits.

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.
