To better\nassess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP\nencounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating\non 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after\nfine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'\nsome domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance\ndeteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present\nCLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware\nrepresentations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while\nstandard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,\nthis can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of\ndomain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead\nhypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective\ndomain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and\nenhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head\nand synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages\ndomain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain\nfeatures.
