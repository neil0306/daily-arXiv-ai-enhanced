### [1] [Activation-Space Personality Steering: Hybrid Layer Selection for Stable Trait Control in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03738)
*Pranav Bhandari,Nicolas Fay,Sanjeevan Selvaganapathy,Amitava Datta,Usman Naseem,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pipeline to extract and control personality traits in LLMs using Big Five personality traits through hidden state activations and low-rank subspace discovery, enabling precise behavioral steering without affecting model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit implicit personalities but lack reliable control mechanisms. There's a need for effective behavioral manipulation and better understanding of psychological constructs within LLMs to enable personality-aware models.

Method: A novel pipeline that extracts hidden state activations using Big Five Personality Traits, applies low-rank subspace discovery methods, identifies trait-specific optimal layers, and implements a flexible steering framework with dynamic layer selection for precise trait control.

Result: Findings show personality traits occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and these latent structures can be transformed into actionable steering mechanisms through careful perturbations without impacting fluency, variance, or general capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach bridges psychological theory with practical model alignment, enabling effective personality trait control in LLMs while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but
reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an
open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation
of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs
to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this
objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and
their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further
investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of
these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel
pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using
the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically
validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace
discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across
different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting
personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible
steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of
trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits
occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be
transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful
perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,
helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model
alignment.

### [2] [TextualVerifier: Verify TextGrad Step-by-Step](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03739)
*Eugenius Mario Situmorang,Adila Alfa Krisnadhi,Ari Wibisono*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TextualVerifier is a self-verification framework for TextGrad that uses chain-of-thought reasoning and majority voting with LLMs to improve reasoning validity in text-based optimization systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TextGrad lacks self-verification mechanisms for ensuring reasoning validity in text-based decision making, creating a verification gap in composite AI systems.

Method: Four-stage workflow: chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and consensus aggregation. Integrates with TextGrad at loss function and optimization result verification stages.

Result: 29% improvement in reasoning step validity; 2.2 percentage point gain (68.2% to 70.4%) with 5.9 LLM calls overhead; 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92 percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.

Conclusion: TextualVerifier is the first self-verification framework for TextGrad using LLM-based techniques without numerical gradients, enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for text-based optimization verification.

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that
enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical
equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure
reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces
TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought
reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this
verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow:
chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and
consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the
loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental
evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1)
standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad
on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves
the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into
TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4
percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further
evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92
percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.
TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for
TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients,
enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in
text-based optimization.

fine-tuning experiments to see the effect of good quality dialectal data on a
number of LLMs. We fine-tune three model architectures (Llama-3-8B,
Llama-3.1-8B, Krikri-8B) and compare the results to frontier models
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5, ChatGPT-5).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited support for non-English languages in LLM development and create high-quality, culturally relevant Polish language models beyond the English-centric commercial landscape.

Method: Built a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus, created 77k custom instructions and 100k preference optimization datasets, implemented Responsible AI framework with strict data governance and hybrid safety filtering.

Result: Successfully developed the largest open-source family of Polish foundation models with demonstrated utility in public administration downstream tasks.

Conclusion: PLLuM fosters open research and strengthens sovereign AI technologies in Poland by providing transparent, culturally relevant language models for the Polish language community.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a central role in modern artificial
intelligence, yet their development has been primarily focused on English,
resulting in limited support for other languages. We present PLLuM (Polish
Large Language Model), the largest open-source family of foundation models
tailored specifically for the Polish language. Developed by a consortium of
major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality,
transparent, and culturally relevant language models beyond the English-centric
commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the
construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a
77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A
key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data
governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We
detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques
for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in
a downstream task within public administration. By releasing these models
publicly, PLLuM aims to foster open research and strengthen sovereign AI
technologies in Poland.

### [5] [STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection Sampling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03827)
*Mohammad Atif Quamar,Mohammad Areeb,Mikhail Kuznetsov,Muslum Ozgur Ozmen,Z. Berkay Celik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STARS is a decoding-time algorithm that improves LLM alignment by sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short token segments iteratively, achieving better performance than fine-tuning methods with higher computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aligning LLMs with human values (fine-tuning, Best-of-N sampling) are computationally expensive and suboptimal, creating a need for more efficient alignment approaches.

Method: STARS uses segment-level token alignment with rejection sampling - iteratively sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting fixed-size token segments during decoding to enable early correction of generation paths.

Result: STARS outperforms SFT by up to 14.9 percentage points and DPO by up to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates across six LLMs, while remaining competitive with Best-of-N baselines.

Conclusion: Granular, reward-guided sampling provides a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe
deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally
expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N
sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal
alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection
Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively
sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.
This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly
improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a
suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up
to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with
strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided
sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional
fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

### [6] [Divide, Cache, Conquer: Dichotomic Prompting for Efficient Multi-Label LLM-Based Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03830)
*Mikołaj Langner,Jan Eliasz,Ewa Rudnicka,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Efficient multi-label text classification using LLMs by reformulating tasks as sequences of yes/no decisions per label dimension, with prefix caching for efficiency and distillation for model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of traditional multi-label classification with LLMs where all labels are generated in a single structured response, which is computationally expensive for short-text inference.

Method: Decompose multi-label classification into independent dichotomic (yes/no) queries per target dimension, use prefix caching for efficiency gains, and employ LLM-to-SLM distillation where a large annotator model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations to fine-tune smaller models.

Result: Fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot baselines, particularly on training dimensions, with substantial efficiency gains for short-text inference without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The dichotomic query decomposition combined with distillation and cache-aware inference provides a scalable and effective framework for LLM-based classification, applicable across domains beyond the validated affective text analysis.

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with
large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as
sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in
a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently,
which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency
gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the
approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including
emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator
model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are
aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B,
Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot
baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings
suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries,
combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and
effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method
on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

### [7] [Evaluating Machine Translation Datasets for Low-Web Data Languages: A Gendered Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03880)
*Hellina Hailu Nigatu,Bethelhem Yemane Mamo,Bontu Fufa Balcha,Debora Taye Tesfaye,Elbethel Daniel Zewdie,Ikram Behiru Nesiru,Jitu Ewnetu Hailu,Senait Mengesha Yayo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of Machine Translation datasets for three low-resourced languages (Afan Oromo, Amharic, Tigrinya) reveals significant gender representation issues including male gender skew, stereotypical depictions, and harmful content against women.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the quality of MT datasets for low-resourced languages, addressing concerns that prioritizing quantity over quality leads to poor-performing technologies and perpetuation of societal biases.

Method: Analyzed gender representation in MT datasets through examination of names, grammatical gender of verbs, stereotypical depictions, and harmful content across three low-resourced languages.

Result: Found large male gender skew in all analyzed aspects, harmful/toxic depictions against women (more prominent in languages with larger datasets), and domain mismatches between training data (political/religious) and benchmark datasets (news/health/sports).

Conclusion: Quantity does not guarantee quality in low-resourced language datasets; work highlights need for early mitigation of harmful content and further inquiry into dataset quality.

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research,
there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing
quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform
poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates
societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine
Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,
Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the
datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large
representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are
focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the
male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in
stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic
depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the
largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.
We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for
low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.

### [8] [GRAD: Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03900)
*Manh Nguyen,Sunil Gupta,Dai Do,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAD is a decoding-time method that mitigates LLM hallucinations by constructing token transition graphs from retrieved corpora and adaptively fusing evidence-based logits with model logits during generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination mitigation approaches rely on external knowledge sources through prompting or retrieval, but prompt-based grounding is fragile and symbolic knowledge integration is costly. The authors were motivated by knowledge graphs to develop a more efficient method.

Method: GRAD constructs sparse token transition graphs by accumulating next-token logits across a small retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor high-evidence continuations.

Result: Across three models and multiple QA benchmarks, GRAD consistently outperformed baselines with 9.7% higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6% lower hallucination rates, and 6.9% greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, achieving the highest truth-informativeness product score.

Conclusion: GRAD provides a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more truthful and verifiable outputs.

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language
models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on
external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,
accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is
fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy
retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds
generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a
sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small
retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved
logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor
high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a
range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic
hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,
achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination
rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while
attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.
GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding
and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from
corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more
truthful and verifiable outputs.

*Alvin Wei Ming Tan,Ben Prystawski,Veronica Boyce,Michael C. Frank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Testing humans vs vision-language models on iterated reference games shows models perform poorly without context but improve dramatically with relevant context, though abstract referents remain challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test agents' ability for context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments through iterated reference games.

Method: Comparing humans and vision-language models on iterated reference game trials with varied context (amount, order, relevance).

Result: Models performed above chance but worse than humans without relevant context; performance increased dramatically with relevant context; abstract referents remained difficult for models.

Conclusion: Few-shot reference games with abstract referents remain a challenging task for machine learning models despite improvements with relevant context.

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel
referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform
context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We
tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference
games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance.
Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than
humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased
dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents
remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HFGI, a high-resolution index measuring human flourishing using 2.6 billion geolocated tweets analyzed by fine-tuned LLMs across 48 indicators, validated against established measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing measures of human flourishing lack fine spatial and temporal resolution needed to understand societal well-being beyond economic indicators.

Method: Analyzed 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework.

Result: Created monthly/yearly county- and state-level indicators of flourishing-related discourse, validated to accurately represent underlying constructs and show expected correlations with established indicators.

Conclusion: HFGI enables unprecedented resolution for multidisciplinary analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change across the U.S. over the past decade.

Abstract: Quantifying human flourishing, a multidimensional construct including
happiness, health, purpose, virtue, relationships, and financial stability, is
critical for understanding societal well-being beyond economic indicators.
Existing measures often lack fine spatial and temporal resolution. Here we
introduce the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), derived from analyzing
approximately 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned
large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with
Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration
and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and
state-level indicators of flourishing-related discourse, validated to confirm
that the measures accurately represent the underlying constructs and show
expected correlations with established indicators. This resource enables
multidisciplinary analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change at
unprecedented resolution, offering insights into the dynamics of human
flourishing as reflected in social media discourse across the United States
over the past decade.

*Fu-Chun Yang,Jason Eshraghian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent bridges via vector translations enable direct semantic exchange between LLMs, allowing cross-model communication without token overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent LLM systems pass messages as plain tokens, discarding latent semantics and constraining information transfer with unnecessary computational overhead.

Method: Use learned vector translations between representation spaces via dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct, with conservative vector injection at 30% blending strength.

Result: Achieved 0.538 average cosine alignment, preserved computational stability, and showed 2.01:1 transfer asymmetry favoring general-purpose models over instruction-tuned variants.

Conclusion: Cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems that share meaning rather than tokens while maintaining computational stability.

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large
language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent
semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary
computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which
use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between
representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and
Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the
translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's
generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a
2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more
transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative
injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that
cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems
that share meaning rather than tokens.

*Shiyin Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework integrating abductive inference into RAG systems to handle incomplete evidence by generating and validating missing premises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in reasoning that need to be bridged.

Method: Detects insufficient evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through consistency and plausibility checks.

Result: Improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness on abductive reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Abductive inference is a promising direction for enhancing robustness and explainability of RAG systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance
in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved
evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,
\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing
premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge
these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive
inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient
evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through
consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive
reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both
answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive
inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and
explainability of RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Weakly Supervised Transducer (WST) for ASR that handles noisy transcripts without needing confidence estimation or pre-trained models, maintaining performance with up to 70% transcription errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNN-T models require large-scale high-quality annotated data which is costly and difficult to obtain, creating a need for methods that work with imperfect transcripts.

Method: Integrates a flexible training graph designed to robustly handle errors in transcripts without requiring additional confidence estimation or auxiliary pre-trained models.

Result: WST maintains performance with transcription error rates up to 70%, consistently outperforming existing CTC-based weakly supervised approaches like BTC and OTC on synthetic and industrial datasets.

Conclusion: WST demonstrates practical utility and robustness in realistic ASR settings, offering an effective solution for training with noisy transcripts.

Abstract: The Recurrent Neural Network-Transducer (RNN-T) is widely adopted in
end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks but depends heavily
on large-scale, high-quality annotated data, which are often costly and
difficult to obtain. To mitigate this reliance, we propose a Weakly Supervised
Transducer (WST), which integrates a flexible training graph designed to
robustly handle errors in the transcripts without requiring additional
confidence estimation or auxiliary pre-trained models. Empirical evaluations on
synthetic and industrial datasets reveal that WST effectively maintains
performance even with transcription error rates of up to 70%, consistently
outperforming existing Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based weakly
supervised approaches, such as Bypass Temporal Classification (BTC) and
Omni-Temporal Classification (OTC). These results demonstrate the practical
utility and robustness of WST in realistic ASR settings. The implementation
will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: T-FIX is a benchmark for evaluating LLM explanations' alignment with expert intuition across seven knowledge-intensive domains, addressing limitations of current evaluation schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM explanation evaluations focus on plausibility and internal faithfulness but fail to assess whether explanations align with expert-level reasoning, which is crucial in knowledge-intensive domains like medicine and science.

Method: Developed T-FIX benchmark spanning seven knowledge-intensive domains in collaboration with domain experts, and created novel metrics to measure LLM explanation alignment with expert judgment.

Result: The paper introduces formalized expert alignment as an evaluation criterion and provides a comprehensive benchmark with domain-expert-validated metrics for assessing LLM explanations.

Conclusion: T-FIX addresses a critical gap in LLM evaluation by focusing on expert alignment rather than just plausibility, providing a more meaningful assessment framework for knowledge-intensive applications.

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.

*Xinying Qian,Ying Zhang,Yu Zhao,Baohang Zhou,Xuhui Sui,Xiaojie Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoK framework enhances LLMs for temporal reasoning by decomposing questions into structured plans and retrieving temporally-aligned facts from TKGs, achieving state-of-the-art TKGQA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TKGQA methods fail to fully understand complex temporal constraints, while LLMs have strong semantic understanding but limited temporal reasoning ability and suffer from hallucination.

Method: Proposes Plan of Knowledge (PoK) framework with contrastive temporal retriever: decomposes questions into sub-objectives via pre-defined tools, and constructs Temporal Knowledge Store with contrastive retrieval to find semantically and temporally aligned facts.

Result: Significantly improves retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy on four TKGQA benchmarks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to 56.0%.

Conclusion: PoK effectively enhances interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning by combining structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer
time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG
embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to
fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress,
benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning
generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains
limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To
address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a
contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed
Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence
of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance
for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store
(TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively
retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining
structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances
the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly
improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the
performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.

*Špela Vintar,Jan Jona Javoršek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparison of word associations between humans and LLMs shows moderate overlap, with LLM associations being more emotionally amplified, predictable, and less creative than human responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if large language models generate word associations similar to humans, especially for emotionally loaded words, and to explore differences in creative associative behavior.

Method: Comparative analysis of associative behavior between humans and large language models, focusing on responses to emotionally loaded word cues.

Result: Moderate overlap between human and LLM associations, but LLM associations amplify emotional load of stimuli and are more predictable and less creative than human associations.

Conclusion: LLMs generate word associations differently from humans - they are more emotionally amplified, predictable, and less creative, suggesting fundamental differences in how language models process and associate concepts compared to human mental lexicons.

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the
internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human
participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced
by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to
form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving
mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour
of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore
associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large
language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that
the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations
of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that
they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer-based de-identification model trained on large multimodal radiology datasets outperforms academic and commercial systems in PHI detection, achieving F1 scores up to 0.996 with strong cross-institutional generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by scaling transformer-based models through extensive training and benchmarking against commercial systems for better protected health information detection.

Method: Fine-tuned transformer-based PHI de-identification pipeline on two large annotated radiology corpora from Stanford, added AGE category, evaluated on Stanford and Penn test sets, assessed synthetic PHI generation stability, and compared with commercial vendor systems.

Result: Achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 (Penn) and 0.996 (Stanford), outperforming previous models. Synthetic PHI evaluation showed consistent detectability (F1: 0.959). Model outperformed all vendor systems on synthetic reports (F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).

Conclusion: Transformer-based de-identification model trained on diverse radiology datasets establishes new benchmark for secure clinical text processing, outperforming prior academic and commercial systems with improved generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.

### [18] [A Characterization of List Language Identification in the Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04103)
*Moses Charikar,Chirag Pabbaraju,Ambuj Tewari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies k-list language identification in the limit, where learners can output k guesses at each step. It provides an exact characterization of language collections that can be k-list identified, showing they can be decomposed into k collections each identifiable with single guesses. The work also establishes exponential identification rates in statistical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical language identification in the limit is impossible for most interesting language collections (Gold's result). Recent positive results for language generation motivate revisiting identification with enhanced learner capabilities - specifically allowing lists of k guesses rather than single guesses.

Method: The authors develop a recursive characterization based on Angluin's original work for single-guess identification. They analyze the problem theoretically by examining when language collections can be decomposed into k subcollections, each identifiable with single guesses. They also extend the analysis to statistical settings with i.i.d. streams.

Result: Exact characterization: A language collection can be k-list identified iff it can be decomposed into k collections each identifiable with single guesses. In statistical settings, k-list identifiable collections can be identified at exponential rates, which is optimal. Non-identifiable collections cannot achieve any convergence rate to zero.

Conclusion: Allowing learners to output lists of guesses significantly expands the scope of identifiable language collections. The decomposition characterization provides a clean theoretical understanding, and the exponential rates in statistical settings show the practical feasibility of this approach.

Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

*Wenmo Qiu,Saurabh Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Batch prompting in LLMs improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token usage by 3x-5x, acting as an inference-time regularizer that suppresses overthinking and encourages decisive answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore batch prompting's underappreciated benefit as a regularizer for multi-step reasoning in Large Reasoning Models, beyond just inference cost amortization.

Method: Comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks with detailed behavioral analysis of batched inference, examining effects on overthinking, hedging language, and collective patterns.

Result: Batching improves accuracy while reducing reasoning token usage by 3x-5x, suppresses overthinking, reduces repetitive self-corrections, and shows emergent collective effects where models generalize patterns across examples.

Conclusion: Batching serves as a powerful inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning, positioning it beyond just throughput optimization.

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference
cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching
offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior
during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a
comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching
improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by
3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses
overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and
encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent
collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from
earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings
position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful
inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

### [20] [RIDE: Difficulty Evolving Perturbation with Item Response Theory for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04120)
*Xinyuan Li,Murong Xu,Wenbiao Tao,Hanlun Zhu,Yike Zhao,Jipeng Zhang,Yunshi Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RIDE is an adversarial question-rewriting framework that uses Item Response Theory to create more challenging mathematical problems, revealing LLMs' limited robustness in mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations may be inflated by training data leakage and superficial pattern matching rather than genuine mathematical reasoning ability, requiring adversarial perturbation-based evaluation.

Method: Propose RIDE framework that leverages Item Response Theory to measure question difficulty, builds a difficulty ranker from 35 LLMs' responses, and uses reinforcement learning to rewrite questions across difficulty levels.

Result: RIDE-generated perturbed versions degrade advanced LLM performance by an average 21.73% across 26 models, exposing limited robustness in mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework successfully creates intrinsically more challenging, well-posed mathematical problems and confirms the validity of adversarial evaluation for measuring true mathematical reasoning ability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical
reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an
adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true
mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often
generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question
difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item
Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate
intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems.
We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their
responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning
and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across
difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks
yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with
experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing
limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our
evaluation approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CantoASR is a collaborative ASR-LALM framework that integrates forced alignment, LoRA-finetuned Whisper for tone discrimination, and instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for prosody-aware correction to improve Cantonese speech recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource Cantonese ASR faces challenges due to limited annotated data, six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation, leading to high word error rates in existing models like Whisper.

Method: Collaborative framework combining forced alignment for acoustic feature extraction, LoRA-finetuned Whisper for improved tone discrimination, and instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for prosody-aware error correction.

Result: Substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3 on spontaneous Cantonese data.

Conclusion: Integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility,
yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data,
six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such
as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language
models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but
still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR,
a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced
alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for
improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for
prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show
substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that
integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for
low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

TL;DR: Multi-agent LLM pipelines improve SQL generation from natural language, with discussion and planner-coder approaches boosting small model performance by up to 10.6% and achieving 56.4% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with SQL generation due to large schemas and complex reasoning, while smaller efficient models are overlooked in favor of impractical complex pipelines.

Method: Three multi-agent pipelines: (1) Multi-agent discussion with iterative critique and judge synthesis, (2) Planner-Coder with stepwise SQL generation plans, (3) Coder-Aggregator with multiple coders and reasoning agent selection.

Result: Multi-agent discussion improved small model performance by up to 10.6% (Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct). Planner-Coder pipeline achieved highest accuracy of 56.4% with DeepSeek-R1-32B/QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT from 52.4%.

Conclusion: Multi-agent LLM pipelines effectively enhance SQL generation, with planner-coder approach yielding best results, demonstrating the potential of collaborative agent systems for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even
laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large
Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions
due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on
complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller,
efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent
LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small
to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents
iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final
answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates
stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)
Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL
queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the
Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small
model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for
Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines,
the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B
and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest
score of 56.4%. Codes are available at

*Mohammed Musthafa Rafi,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Aditya Balu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAAC proposes using LLMs as communication intermediaries to enable authentic knowledge exchange, addressing trust gaps in information fidelity, reproducibility, and query response integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter the absurd communication theater where AI-generated content is inflated and compressed without authentic engagement, and to facilitate genuine knowledge exchange.

Method: Multi-agent architecture with structured dialogue for intent capture, systematic evaluation of trust dimensions (information fidelity, reproducibility, query integrity) through controlled experiments across multiple use cases.

Result: Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps in LAAC's deployment across communication domains, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.

Conclusion: Critical trustworthiness requirements must be addressed before LAAC can be reliably deployed as communication intermediaries, with identified gaps in fidelity, consistency, and reliability.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication
theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content,
recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence
neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)
proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication
intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and
facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating
cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic
communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,
professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying
LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about
information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper
systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment
across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental
dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction
during sender interviews across different communication types, (2)
Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple
interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of
recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or
fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,
we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.
Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before
LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

*Nicolò Pagan,Petter Törnberg,Christopher A. Bail,Anikó Hannák,Christopher Barrie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational Turing test framework to validate LLMs' ability to generate human-like text, finding that even after calibration, LLM outputs remain distinguishable from human text with a trade-off between human-likeness and semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current validation of LLMs for simulating human behavior relies on unreliable human-judgment-based evaluations, lacking robust tools for assessing realism or calibrating models to real-world data.

Method: Developed a computational Turing test framework combining aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability, semantic similarity) with interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers, topical patterns), and systematically compared 9 open-weight LLMs across 5 calibration strategies on social media data.

Result: LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable from human text even after calibration, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression. Instruction-tuned models underperform base models, scaling model size doesn't enhance human-likeness, and there's a trade-off between optimizing for human-likeness versus semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable validation framework for LLM simulations but cautions about current limitations in capturing human communication, highlighting the need for better calibration methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to
simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate
realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested.
Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --
testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence
that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks
robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating
models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we
introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates
aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with
interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to
assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.
Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration
strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval
-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly
Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the
literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.
Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up
model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:
optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and
vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for
validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note
about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

TL;DR: Current LLMs cannot pass Poland's National Appeal Chamber exam despite good performance on knowledge tests, failing the practical written judgment part and showing limitations in legal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically assess whether current large language models can pass a professional legal qualification exam and evaluate the 'LLM-as-a-judge' approach for automated assessment.

Method: Tested multiple LLMs (GPT-4.1, Claude 4 Sonnet, Bielik-11B-v2.6) in closed-book and Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings on a Polish legal exam consisting of multiple-choice knowledge tests and written judgments, using a hybrid information recovery pipeline.

Result: Models achieved satisfactory scores in knowledge tests but none met passing threshold in practical written part; LLM-as-a-judge evaluations often diverged from official committee judgments.

Conclusion: Current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or examiners in Polish public procurement adjudication due to hallucinations, incorrect legal citations, weak logical argumentation, and need for expert collaboration.

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language
models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in
Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors
examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the
'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically
evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which
includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a
written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction
pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4
Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various
Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the
models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing
threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the
'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining
committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to
hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical
argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and
technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological
progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners
in Polish public procurement adjudication.

*Liran Cohen,Yaniv Nemcovesky,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REMIND is a novel evaluation method for machine unlearning that detects residual memorization by analyzing loss patterns over small input variations, providing more sensitive assessment than single-point evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning evaluation methods focus on individual inputs but may miss residual influence in semantically similar examples, which can compromise privacy and lead to information leakage.

Method: REMIND analyzes the model's loss landscape over small input variations (neighborhood dynamics) to detect patterns - unlearned data show flatter loss landscapes while retained data exhibit sharper patterns.

Result: REMIND outperforms existing methods, requires only query-based access, and demonstrates robustness across different models, datasets, and paraphrased inputs.

Conclusion: REMIND provides a more sensitive and interpretable framework for assessing unlearning effectiveness in language models, offering a novel perspective on memorization and unlearning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data
from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for
ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying
whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining
reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often
assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook
residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can
compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND
(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method
aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify
whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's
loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point
evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss
landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile
patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods
under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,
datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world
deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of
unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess
unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective
on memorization and unlearning.

TL;DR: Pre-training leaves significant dataset value unused; retrieval at test time provides 5x compute multiplier gains on MMLU and up to 10% accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify how much knowledge pre-training fails to extract from datasets and understand efficiency across model scales.

Method: Use retrieval augmented generation with test-time compute to measure unused dataset value, testing on standard datasets with decontamination.

Result: Significant accuracy gains on MMLU, Math-500, and SimpleQA; retrieval provides ~5x compute multiplier on MMLU; 10% improvement on MMLU for LLaMA 3.1 8B.

Conclusion: Current pre-training methods don't fully utilize dataset information, leaving substantial room for improvement in knowledge extraction.

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the
ability to solve an ever increasing variety of tasks; yet although researchers
work to improve these datasets, there is little effort to understand how
efficient the pre-training apparatus is at extracting ideas and knowledge from
the data. In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with
test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind
by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We
demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely
open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500,
and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that
retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show
that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at
test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point
improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results
suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the
information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for
progress.

### [28] [Efficient Topic Extraction via Graph-Based Labeling: A Lightweight Alternative to Deep Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04248)
*Salma Mekaoui,Hiba Sofyan,Imane Amaaz,Imane Benchrif,Arsalane Zarghili,Ilham Chaker,Nikola S. Nikolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A graph-based approach for topic labeling that assigns meaningful labels to topic modeling outputs, achieving comparable performance to ChatGPT-3.5 with better computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topic modeling produces word distributions that lack clear interpretability, and existing methods are computationally expensive. There's a need for efficient alternatives that can generate meaningful topic labels.

Method: Proposed a graph-based approach that enriches topic words with semantically related terms and analyzes relationships among them to derive suitable labels.

Result: The method consistently outperformed traditional benchmarks in BERTScore and cosine similarity, and achieved results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5 while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Graph-based topic labeling provides an effective and efficient alternative to computationally expensive methods, with potential for future enhancements in interpretability and automation.

Abstract: Extracting topics from text has become an essential task, especially with the
rapid growth of unstructured textual data. Most existing works rely on highly
computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that
probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can
offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is
a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections
of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of
representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is
to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of
words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we
propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with
semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By
analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that
accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between
our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two
different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than
traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced
results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient.
Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight
potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

### [29] [SSPO: Subsentence-level Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04256)
*Kun Yang,Zikang chen,Yanmeng Wang,Zhigen Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSPO introduces sentence-level importance ratio for RLVR, balancing between token-level GRPO and response-level GSPO to avoid training collapse while improving data utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR algorithms like GRPO suffer from unstable policy updates due to token-level importance ratio being affected by outliers, while GSPO has low data utilization because entire responses can be discarded due to extreme importance ratio values.

Method: SSPO applies sentence-level importance ratio calculation and incorporates sentence entropy into PPO-CLIP to dynamically adjust clipping bounds, encouraging exploration for high-entropy tokens while narrowing clipping range for low-entropy tokens.

Result: SSPO achieves average score of 46.57 across five datasets, outperforming GRPO (43.01) and GSPO (44.42), and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets.

Conclusion: SSPO effectively leverages generated data by adopting the advantages of GSPO while addressing its shortcomings, demonstrating superior performance in RLVR for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs),
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs'
reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative
Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are
observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,
respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,
which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected
by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation
of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high
variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO
importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common
importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,
leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a
decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which
applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and
GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also
prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping
mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily
adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and
narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves
an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and
GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These
results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking
the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

*Mohammad Amin Ghanizadeh,Mohammad Javad Dousti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A data selection method for fine-tuning machine translation that uses learnability scores and batch selection to improve data efficiency and translation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data quality and effective selection are fundamental for improving machine translation model performance and achieving robust systems.

Method: Leverages synergy between learner and reference models to define learnability scores, employs batch selection considering data interdependencies, and focuses on selecting most relevant examples for fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves up to 5x improvement in data efficiency compared to iid baseline, 24x computational efficiency with cached embeddings, and superior translation performance over random selection.

Conclusion: The proposed data selection methodology effectively enhances training efficiency and generalization in machine translation systems.

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the
performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for
achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data
selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation
systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained
reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a
learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data
points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful
examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs
a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,
optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on
data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language
pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that
our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared
to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves
computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires
fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting
in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

*Lars Bungum,Charles Yijia Huang,Abeer Kashar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs were tested on temporal reasoning using 1940 Norwegian trivia questions, with better performance in English than Norwegian and improvements from larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities by testing their ability to answer historical trivia questions from 1940 as if they were in that time period.

Method: Used a 1940 Norwegian trivia book to prompt LLMs in both English and Norwegian, employing LLM-as-judge grading with human verification.

Result: English prompting consistently outperformed Norwegian, and larger LLMs showed better performance across DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, Llama3.1, and specialized Norwegian models.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate temporal reasoning ability but perform better in English than their native language, with model size being a key factor in performance.

Abstract: In this study, we experiment with the ability of LLMs to do temporal
reasoning. Using a Norwegian book from 1940 containing trivia questions, we
prompt the LLMs to answer the questions as if it were 1940. We also pose the
questions in both English and Norwegian. Correct answers are often presented as
sentences, and grading is done by means of LLM-as-judge, with sampled checks by
a native speaker. Prompting in English consistently gave better results than in
Norwegian, an unexpected result. In contrast, using larger LLMs improved
results. We tested the DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1 model families,
and also the largest available LLM especially crafted for Norwegian.

TL;DR: PTTSD is a probabilistic framework for depression detection from clinical interviews that predicts PHQ-8 scores with uncertainty estimates over time, achieving state-of-the-art performance among text-only systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depression detection models lack uncertainty estimates and temporal modeling, which are essential for clinical decision support and interpretable predictions.

Method: Proposes PTTSD with sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants using bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, residual connections, and Gaussian/Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood.

Result: Achieves MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC and 3.55 on DAIC-WOZ, producing well-calibrated prediction intervals and outperforming text-only systems. Ablations confirm attention and probabilistic modeling value.

Conclusion: PTTSD provides interpretable, uncertainty-aware depression forecasting with clinical relevance, demonstrated through calibration analysis and case studies.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.

TL;DR: ThaiOCRBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks, addressing the underrepresentation of Thai in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal benchmarks predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented, especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding.

Method: Created a diverse, human-annotated dataset of 2,808 samples across 13 task categories and evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings, including both proprietary and open-source systems.

Result: Proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) significantly outperform open-source counterparts, with fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content extraction showing the steepest performance drops among open-source models.

Conclusion: ThaiOCRBench provides a standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex settings and identifies key challenges like language bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content for improving Thai-language document understanding.

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks.
Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented,
especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench
addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising
2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of
state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and
open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with
proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source
counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content
extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models.
Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language
bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a
standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex
settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document
understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RUST-BENCH is a new benchmark for tabular reasoning that uses 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables across science (NSF grants) and sports (NBA stats) domains, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that use small, uniform tables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks use small, uniform tables that don't represent real-world data complexity, giving an incomplete view of LLMs' reasoning abilities. Real tables are long, heterogeneous, domain-specific, and require multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens.

Method: Created RUST-BENCH with 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables spanning NSF grant records (RB-Science) and NBA statistics (RB-Sports), evaluating LLMs across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning complexity.

Result: Experiments show LLMs struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.

Conclusion: RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular reasoning research by better representing real-world table complexity.

Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform
tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an
incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real
tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields
with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To
address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from
2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records)
and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates
LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning
complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs
struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing
persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents OUNLP's system for TSAR-2025 Shared Task on readability-controlled text simplification using LLM prompting, proposing multi-round simplification methods that leverage the gap between source and target CEFR levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research was motivated by the discovery that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between source and target CEFR levels, leading to the development of multi-round simplification approaches.

Method: Proposed two multi-round simplification methods using GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based LLM simplification (MRS-Joint), where the latter uses LLM simplified candidates as starting points.

Result: The submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams, and later improvements showed that using LLM simplified candidates as starting points could further boost multi-round simplification performance.

Conclusion: Multi-round simplification methods that consider the CEFR level gap and leverage LLM-generated candidates as starting points can effectively improve text simplification performance.

Abstract: This paper describes the OUNLP system submitted to the TSAR-2025 Shared Task
(Alva-Manchego et al., 2025), designed for readability-controlled text
simplification using LLM-prompting-based generation. Based on the analysis of
prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding
that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the
source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by
this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate
them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based
LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.
Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified
candidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round
simplification performance.

Motivation: As LLMs become integral to human-centered applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is important for responsible development and deployment.

Method: Applied the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework to evaluate six LLMs under varying sampling temperatures, using hierarchical clustering to identify model clusters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAGalyst is an automated, human-aligned agentic framework for evaluating domain-specific RAG systems, addressing limitations of existing heuristic-based and LLM-as-a-Judge approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluation frameworks fail to capture domain-specific nuances and lack validated alignment with human judgment, creating challenges for safety-critical domains.

Method: Uses an agentic pipeline to generate synthetic QA datasets from source documents with filtering for data fidelity, and refines LLM-as-a-Judge metrics through prompt optimization to achieve human alignment.

Result: Performance of RAG components is highly context-dependent across military operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering domains, with no universally optimal configuration. Identified common low Answer Correctness reasons.

Conclusion: Systematic evaluation frameworks like RAGalyst are necessary to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and enable informed design choices for reliable RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical technique for grounding
Large Language Models (LLMs) in factual evidence, yet evaluating RAG systems in
specialized, safety-critical domains remains a significant challenge. Existing
evaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to
capture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge
approaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper
introduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for
the rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an
agentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA)
datasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to
ensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge
metrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to
achieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to
evaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military
operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is
highly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter
configuration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis
on the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings
highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst,
which empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make
informed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems.

*Paloma Rabaey,Jong Hak Moon,Jung-Oh Lee,Min Gwan Kim,Hangyul Yoon,Thomas Demeester,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lunguage++, an uncertainty-aware structured radiology report benchmark that quantifies explicit uncertainty through LLM-based phrase ranking and models implicit uncertainty via diagnostic pathway expansions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology reports contain valuable clinical information but often include uncertainty that hinders automated analysis. Two types of uncertainty exist: explicit (hedging phrases) and implicit (omitted reasoning), which current rule-based systems cannot adequately handle.

Method: Two-part framework: (1) Quantify explicit uncertainty using expert-validated LLM-based reference ranking of hedging phrases mapped to probability values; (2) Model implicit uncertainty through expansion framework that adds characteristic sub-findings from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for 14 common diagnoses.

Result: Development of Lunguage++, an expanded uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark that enables uncertainty-aware image classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and investigation of clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses both explicit and implicit uncertainty in radiology reports, creating a valuable resource for uncertainty-aware clinical analysis and advancing automated radiology report processing.

Abstract: Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

*Amir Zur,Atticus Geiger,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Eric Bigelow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models implicitly represent alternate reasoning paths through hidden activations, which can predict uncertainty and future outcomes during chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if language models represent the alternate reasoning paths they could take during generation, as token selection can lead to very different reasoning paths making uncertainty difficult to quantify.

Method: Using hidden activations to control and predict a language model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning, testing how easily models can be steered by activation interventions.

Result: Found clear correlation between model uncertainty and ease of steering via activation control; activation interventions are most effective when models haven't committed to final answers; hidden activations can predict future outcome distributions.

Conclusion: Language models implicitly represent the space of possible reasoning paths through their hidden activations, which can be used to understand and predict their uncertainty and decision-making process.

Abstract: When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens
might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult
to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models
represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test
this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language
model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we
find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,
and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This
suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are
alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet
committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations
can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models
implicitly represent the space of possible paths.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between automated essay scoring systems and user experience by providing interactive analysis with human oversight and better understanding of argumentative structure.

Method: Uses LLMs to classify and score argument relations, visualizes them as graphs, provides justifications for classifications, and offers quantitative coherence measures with natural language tools.

Result: Developed a live interactive system that enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while maintaining human oversight capabilities.

Conclusion: IntelliProof successfully creates an interactive bridge between structural semantics of argumentative essays and user understanding, with a working demo available for testing.

Abstract: We present IntelliProof, an interactive system for analyzing argumentative
essays through LLMs. IntelliProof structures an essay as an argumentation
graph, where claims are represented as nodes, supporting evidence is attached
as node properties, and edges encode supporting or attacking relations. Unlike
existing automated essay scoring systems, IntelliProof emphasizes the user
experience: each relation is initially classified and scored by an LLM, then
visualized for enhanced understanding. The system provides justifications for
classifications and produces quantitative measures for essay coherence. It
enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human
oversight. In addition, IntelliProof provides a set of tools for a better
understanding of an argumentative essay and its corresponding graph in natural
language, bridging the gap between the structural semantics of argumentative
essays and the user's understanding of a given text. A live demo and the system
are available here to try: \textbf{https://intelliproof.vercel.app}

*Cyril Vallez,Alexander Sternfeld,Andrei Kucharavy,Ljiljana Dolamic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based coding assistants generate security vulnerabilities that persist in latest models, prompting development of new severity metrics (Prompt Exposure and Model Exposure) to prioritize vulnerability mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM coding assistants become more critical in software development, their generated bugs pose significant cybersecurity risks, yet existing security benchmarks haven't effectively improved model security.

Method: Introduces two new metrics: Prompt Exposure (PE) accounting for vulnerability severity, generation chance, and prompt formulation; and Model Exposure (ME) score indicating overall severity and prevalence of vulnerabilities generated by a model.

Result: Even the latest open-weight LLM models remain vulnerable to early-reported vulnerability scenarios in realistic use settings, suggesting safety-functionality trade-offs prevent effective vulnerability patching.

Conclusion: New severity metrics (PE and ME) are needed to help prioritize and mitigate the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities in LLM-generated code, addressing the current limitations in security improvement approaches.

Abstract: As the role of Large Language Models (LLM)-based coding assistants in
software development becomes more critical, so does the role of the bugs they
generate in the overall cybersecurity landscape. While a number of LLM code
security benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the
security of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have
impacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest
open-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability
scenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality
trade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To
help address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the
risk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability
severity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces
vulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation
of the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the
Model Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of
vulnerabilities a model generates.

Conclusion: RAG-based methods show strong potential to enhance reliability and accessibility of Bangla medical QA, establishing foundation for future multilingual medical AI research.

Abstract: Developing accurate biomedical Question Answering (QA) systems in
low-resource languages remains a major challenge, limiting equitable access to
reliable medical knowledge. This paper introduces BanglaMedQA and
BanglaMMedBench, the first large-scale Bangla biomedical Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) datasets designed to evaluate reasoning and retrieval in medical
artificial intelligence (AI). The study applies and benchmarks several
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies, including Traditional,
Zero-Shot Fallback, Agentic, Iterative Feedback, and Aggregate RAG, combining
textbook-based and web retrieval with generative reasoning to improve factual
accuracy. A key novelty lies in integrating a Bangla medical textbook corpus
through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and implementing an Agentic RAG
pipeline that dynamically selects between retrieval and reasoning strategies.
Experimental results show that the Agentic RAG achieved the highest accuracy
89.54% with openai/gpt-oss-120b, outperforming other configurations and
demonstrating superior rationale quality. These findings highlight the
potential of RAG-based methods to enhance the reliability and accessibility of
Bangla medical QA, establishing a foundation for future research in
multilingual medical artificial intelligence.

*Alamgir Munir Qazi,John P. McCrae,Jamal Abdul Nasir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeReC is a lightweight fact verification framework that uses dense retrieval and classification to outperform LLM-based methods in both accuracy and efficiency, reducing runtime by 92-95% while achieving better F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based fact verification systems face computational barriers and hallucination risks in real-world deployments, necessitating more efficient and robust alternatives.

Method: Combines dense retrieval with specialized classification using general-purpose text embeddings to replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches.

Result: Achieves 65.58% F1 score on RAWFC (surpassing L-Defense's 61.20%), reduces runtime by 95% on RAWFC (23m36s vs 454m12s) and 92% on LIAR-RAW (134m14s vs 1692m23s).

Conclusion: Carefully engineered retrieval-based systems can match or exceed LLM performance in specialized tasks while being significantly more practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation necessitates robust yet computationally
efficient fact verification systems. While current state-of-the-art approaches
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating explanatory rationales,
these methods face significant computational barriers and hallucination risks
in real-world deployments. We present DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a
lightweight framework that demonstrates how general-purpose text embeddings can
effectively replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification
tasks. By combining dense retrieval with specialized classification, our system
achieves better accuracy while being significantly more efficient. DeReC
outperforms explanation-generating LLMs in efficiency, reducing runtime by 95%
on RAWFC (23 minutes 36 seconds compared to 454 minutes 12 seconds) and by 92%
on LIAR-RAW (134 minutes 14 seconds compared to 1692 minutes 23 seconds),
showcasing its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes. On the RAWFC
dataset, DeReC achieves an F1 score of 65.58%, surpassing the state-of-the-art
method L-Defense (61.20%). Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered
retrieval-based systems can match or exceed LLM performance in specialized
tasks while being significantly more practical for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LEASH is a training-free decoding algorithm that adaptively stops rationale generation in Chain-of-Thought prompting by monitoring token-level entropy slope and top-logit margin improvement, reducing token usage by 30-35% and latency by 27% with minimal accuracy impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought prompting generates full, fixed-length rationales which is computationally wasteful, inflating both token usage and latency.

Method: LEASH monitors two intrinsic signals: the slope of token-level entropy and the improvement in the top-logit margin, terminating generation once both signals plateau indicating stable reasoning state.

Result: Across four instruction-tuned models on GSM8K and AQuA-RAT benchmarks, LEASH reduces average token generation by 30-35% and latency by 27%, while incurring only a 10 percentage point accuracy drop relative to CoT.

Conclusion: LEASH is model-agnostic and requires no additional training or supervision, offering a simple and efficient alternative to CoT decoding.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a key technique for enabling complex

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-Edge enables efficient on-device CNN fine-tuning for edge applications like HAR by combining LoRA with tensor-train decomposition, reducing trainable parameters by up to 100x while maintaining near-full fine-tuning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of CNNs is infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets for edge applications, requiring parameter-efficient methods to handle domain shifts in real-world deployments.

Method: Applies Tensor-Train SVD to pre-trained convolutional layers, selectively updates only output-side core with zero-initialization, and fuses updates back into dense kernels without changing inference cost.

Result: Achieves accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating only 1.49% of parameters, with 1.4-3.8x faster convergence on Jetson Orin Nano compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: LoRA-Edge makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN adaptation practical for edge platforms by preserving convolutional structure and dramatically reducing trainable parameters.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

TL;DR: SILVI is an open-source labeling software that enables annotation of behaviors and interactions in video data, bridging the gap between behavioral labeling and individual localization for automated animal behavior analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing annotation tools either support behavioral labeling without localization or localization without interaction detection, creating a gap for analyzing social and individualized animal behavior through computer vision.

Method: Developed SILVI as an integrated labeling software that combines both behavioral annotation and individual localization functionalities within video data.

Result: SILVI generates structured outputs suitable for training and validating computer vision models, facilitating automated approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses.

Conclusion: SILVI successfully bridges behavioral ecology with computer vision, enabling annotation of interactions in video data and supporting development of automated behavioral analysis methods, with potential applications beyond animal behavior to human interaction annotation.

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,

*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Noise injection during training improves generalization of COVID-19 detection models from chest X-rays by reducing performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL models for COVID-19 detection from CXRs fail to generalize to new clinical sources due to learning source-specific shortcuts rather than meaningful biomarkers.

Method: Applied fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian, Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training to improve model robustness to distribution shifts.

Result: Reduced performance gap between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06 across key metrics (AUC, F1, accuracy, recall, specificity) averaged over ten random seeds.

Conclusion: Noise injection is an effective technique to enhance model robustness and generalization for COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays across different clinical sources.

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores imitation learning for X-ray-guided spine procedures, developing a simulation sandbox and training policies for cannula insertion that achieved 68.5% first-attempt success rates and demonstrated generalization to complex anatomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether imitation learning approaches, which have seen renewed interest in video-based robotics, can be applied to X-ray-guided procedures like spine instrumentation, given the complexity of interpreting multi-view X-rays.

Method: Created an in silico sandbox for automated simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with high realism, curated dataset of correct trajectories and bi-planar X-ray sequences, trained imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively align cannula based on visual information.

Result: Policy succeeded on first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintained safe intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels, generalized to complex anatomy including fractures, remained robust to varied initializations, and produced plausible trajectories on real bi-planar X-rays despite simulation-only training.

Conclusion: While promising with 68.5% first-attempt success and generalization capabilities, limitations exist in entry point precision. Full closed-loop control requires more frequent feedback, but with robust priors and domain knowledge, such models could enable lightweight CT-free robotic spinal navigation.

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the global waste crisis, particularly in remote/harsh environments like deserts where traditional waste collection is inefficient and hazardous, and fill the research gap in detecting organic/hazardous waste in underexplored terrains.

Method: Enhanced real-time object detection framework based on pruned, lightweight YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT) and specialized data augmentation strategies, evaluated using the DroneTrashNet dataset.

Result: Significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants.

Conclusion: Combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements provides an effective solution for robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments, validated through optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Class-Based Image Composition (CoImg) improves deep learning performance on imbalanced medical datasets by fusing multiple same-class images into composite inputs, achieving near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) on OCT retinal scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of small, imbalanced datasets and poor image quality that lead to high false prediction rates in medical imaging deep learning models.

Method: Propose Class-Based Image Composition to create Composite Input Images (CoImg) by fusing multiple images of the same class into combined visual composites, enhancing intra-class variance and information density per training sample.

Result: Achieved near-perfect accuracy (99.6%), F1-score (0.995), and AUC (0.9996) on OCTDL dataset, significantly outperforming baseline model trained on raw dataset with much lower false prediction rates.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles class imbalance and small sample sizes, producing high-quality predictions even for weak datasets, demonstrating practical value for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

*Nand Kumar Yadav,Rodrigue Rizk,William CW Chen,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised anomaly detection framework for medical imaging that incrementally expands normal samples without labels using lightweight adapters and uncertainty-gated admission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging where labeled anomalies are scarce and expert supervision is costly.

Method: Uses frozen pretrained vision backbone with tiny convolutional adapters, k-NN anomaly scoring with coreset storage, and dual probabilistic gates (z-score threshold and SWAG-based epistemic uncertainty) for safe sample admission.

Result: Substantial performance gains: COVID-CXR ROC-AUC from 0.9489 to 0.9982, Pneumonia CXR ROC-AUC from 0.6834 to 0.8968, Brain MRI ND-5 ROC-AUC from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and efficient for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications, steadily refining normality as unlabeled data arrive.

Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

TL;DR: BDR improves boundary detection via signed-distance regression, while ATR allocates computation adaptively via continuous depth selection, achieving better accuracy with less computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current temporal action localization methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in boundary detection difficulty across different action segments.

Method: 1) Boundary Distance Regression (BDR): Uses signed-distance regression instead of classification for optimal boundary localization. 2) Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR): Allocates computation via continuous depth selection τ∈[0,1] for end-to-end differentiable optimization without reinforcement learning.

Result: BDR achieves 43% sharper boundary peaks and improves mAP@0.7 by 1.8-3.1% across architectures. ATR achieves 56.5% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs vs 53.6% at 198G for uniform processing (2.9% improvement with 18% less compute). Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity (4.2% improvement on short actions).

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide information-theoretically optimal localization and adaptive computation allocation, validated across four benchmarks with rigorous statistical testing.

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods decouple geometry and appearance optimization, prioritizing either geometric accuracy or photorealistic rendering, which hinders downstream editing applications.

Method: Simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering, leveraging photometric consistency and geometric regularization from normal and depth maps.

Result: Obtains high-quality 3D reconstruction suitable for downstream editing tasks like relighting and shape deformation.

Conclusion: Proposes a unified treatment of geometry and appearance optimization through Gaussian-mesh joint optimization, enabling seamless 3D reconstruction for editing applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A synthetic dataset called Room Envelopes is introduced to help predict structural scene elements like walls, floors, and ceilings from RGB images, enabling monocular geometry estimators to understand both visible surfaces and structural layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene reconstruction methods produce incomplete results by only recovering visible surfaces, missing occluded structural elements. Structural scene components are relatively easy to predict due to their planar, repetitive, and simple nature, making less costly approaches suitable.

Method: Created a synthetic dataset with RGB images and two associated pointmaps per image: one for visible surfaces and one for structural layouts after removing fixtures. This enables direct supervision for feed-forward monocular geometry estimators.

Result: The dataset facilitates training models that can predict both first visible surfaces and first layout surfaces, providing understanding of scene extent and object shapes/locations.

Conclusion: The Room Envelopes dataset enables progress in predicting structural scene elements through direct supervision for monocular geometry estimation, overcoming limitations of traditional reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Humans use 3D visuospatial pose information for social interaction recognition, which outperforms current AI vision models. A compact set of 3D social pose features (face position and direction) matches full joint data and improves AI performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why humans excel at social interaction recognition while AI struggles, and test the hypothesis that 3D pose information is critical for these judgments.

Method: Combined pose and depth estimation to extract 3D joint positions from videos, compared with AI vision models, and derived minimal 3D social pose features describing face position and direction.

Result: 3D joint positions outperformed most AI models. Minimal 3D social pose features matched full joint predictive strength and improved AI model performance when combined with embeddings. Representation of these features in AI models predicted their social judgment accuracy.

Conclusion: Human social scene understanding relies on explicit 3D pose representations and can be supported by simple visuospatial primitives, suggesting a pathway to improve AI social interaction recognition.

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaRF is a differentiable framework for 3D Gaussian segmentation that achieves multi-view consistency by incorporating camera geometry and cross-view supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with cross-view consistency due to reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision and view-specific feature learning in 3D Gaussian segmentation.

Method: Proposes Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE) to incorporate camera geometry into Gaussian-text interactions, and In-Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) to align per-Gaussian logits across calibrated views during training.

Result: Achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state-of-the-art methods on Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets respectively.

Conclusion: CaRF promotes more reliable and view-consistent 3D scene understanding with potential applications in embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and autonomous perception.

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

*Peiyao Wang,Weining Wang,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysCorr is a framework that improves physical consistency in text-to-video generation by quantifying physical plausibility and optimizing models to produce more realistic object dynamics and interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models generate visually impressive content but often violate physical principles, limiting their use in embodied AI, robotics, and simulation applications where physical realism is crucial.

Method: Proposes PhysicsRM (dual-dimensional reward model for intra-object stability and inter-object interactions) and PhyDPO (direct preference optimization with contrastive feedback and physics-aware reweighting) that can integrate with various video generation backbones.

Result: Extensive experiments show PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while maintaining visual quality and semantic accuracy across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work represents a critical advancement toward physically grounded and trustworthy video generation systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GNN-MoE enhances Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for domain generalization in Vision Transformers using a Mixture-of-Experts framework with graph-based routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fine-tuning of pretrained ViTs for domain generalization is computationally expensive and can hurt generalization performance, creating a need for more efficient adaptation methods.

Method: Proposes GNN-MoE that uses Graph Neural Network routers (GCN, GAT, SAGE) on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to specialized experts, replacing token-based routing with context-aware graph-based routing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on domain generalization benchmarks while maintaining high parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Graph-based contextual routing is effective for creating robust and lightweight domain generalization solutions for Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks robust Vision Transformer (ViT) performance
on unseen domains. Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging;
standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose
GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead
of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT,
SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to
specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch
relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive DG benchmark performance with high parameter
efficiency, highlighting the utility of graph-based contextual routing for
robust, lightweight DG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedDChest is a foundational Vision Transformer pre-trained from scratch on 1.2M thoracic images, using novel Guided Random Resized Crops for domain-specific data augmentation, significantly outperforming ImageNet-pretrained models on medical diagnostic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental domain gap between natural images and medical imaging that hinders vision model performance in thoracic diagnostics.

Method: Pre-trained MedDChest ViT from scratch on 1.2M multimodal thoracic images using Guided Random Resized Crops - a content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases sampling towards anatomically relevant regions.

Result: MedDChest significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained models across diverse downstream diagnostic tasks.

Conclusion: Large-scale in-domain pre-training combined with domain-specific data augmentation provides a powerful and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting point for thoracic diagnostic tasks.

Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting
point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be
made publicly available to foster future research and applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Faithful Contouring is a sparse voxelized representation that achieves near-lossless 3D mesh fidelity at 2048+ resolutions without requiring water-tightening or isosurface extraction, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing voxelized representations based on iso-surface methods compromise geometric fidelity through water-tightening or rendering optimization, failing to preserve sharp features and internal structures in complex meshes.

Method: Proposes Faithful Contouring - a sparse voxelized representation that doesn't convert meshes to field functions or extract isosurface during remeshing. Also designs a dual-mode autoencoder for scalable shape reconstruction.

Result: Achieves distance errors at 10^-5 level for direct representation. For mesh reconstruction: 93% reduction in Chamfer Distance and 35% improvement in F-score over strong baselines. Preserves sharpness and internal structures even in complex geometry.

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring provides superior fidelity as a 3D representation for learning tasks, offering flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing while maintaining near-lossless geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight biometric authentication system using PPG signals from fingertip videos achieves 98% accuracy with a hybrid CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM model that combines spatial and temporal features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG signals offer non-invasive, liveness-detecting biometric authentication suitable for wearables, but face challenges from motion artifacts, illumination changes, and physiological variability.

Method: Preprocess PPG signals with baseline removal, PCA motion artifact suppression, filtering, resampling, and normalization; convert to time-frequency scalograms via CWT; use hybrid CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM model to extract spatial and temporal features.

Result: 98% authentication accuracy on 46 subjects from CFIHSR dataset, demonstrating robustness to noise and inter-subject variability.

Conclusion: The proposed system is efficient, scalable, and suitable for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications due to its liveness detection capability.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bratrix is a multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain alignment framework that improves neural signal decoding by projecting visual and brain representations into a shared latent space with uncertainty-aware weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches align neural activity directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations fail to capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and robustness due to subject variability and entangled visual features.

Method: Decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and linguistic semantic components, projects both into shared latent space, incorporates uncertainty perception module for noisy neural signals, uses learnable language-anchored semantic matrices, and employs two-stage training (single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning).

Result: Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI benchmarks show improved retrieval, reconstruction, and captioning performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task.

Conclusion: Bratrix achieves effective multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain alignment, enhancing neural signal decoding capabilities through semantic disentanglement and uncertainty-aware processing.

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

TL;DR: Comparison of CycleGAN-based residual translator and Noise2Score for CT image denoising in unpaired/self-supervised settings, with CycleGAN achieving superior final quality while Noise2Score offers robust pair-free alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address CT image denoising in scenarios where paired clean/noisy data is unavailable, requiring training-data-efficient methods that work with unpaired or self-supervised regimes.

Method: Evaluated two paradigms: CycleGAN-based residual translator with U-Net backbone and Noise2Score score-matching denoiser. Conducted configuration sweep to identify optimal CycleGAN parameters (lambda_cycle=30, lambda_iden=2, ngf=ndf=64) and trained to convergence.

Result: CycleGAN improved noisy input from 34.66 dB/0.9234 SSIM to 38.913 dB/0.971 SSIM, with estimated score 1.9441 and unseen-set score 1.9343. Noise2Score achieved large gains on very noisy inputs but slightly behind in absolute PSNR/SSIM.

Conclusion: CycleGAN offers strongest final image quality, while Noise2Score provides robust pair-free alternative with competitive performance, highlighting their complementary strengths for different scenarios.

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UKAST integrates rational-function based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders to create a more expressive and data-efficient medical image segmentation architecture that outperforms CNN- and Transformer-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges with complex anatomical structures and limited annotated data. CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies while Transformers are data-hungry and computationally expensive.

Method: Proposed UKAST architecture that integrates rational-function based KANs into Swin Transformer encoders, using Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from KAT to address inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks, with superior accuracy in data-scarce settings and reduced FLOPs compared to SwinUNETR.

Conclusion: KAN-enhanced Transformers show potential to advance data-efficient medical image segmentation, alleviating data-hungry limitations of standard Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialLock is a novel framework for precise object localization in text-to-image generation, using position-engaged injection and position-guided learning to achieve state-of-the-art IOU scores above 0.9.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image synthesis methods struggle with precise control over object localization and fail to fully utilize positional information, leading to inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts.

Method: SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection (PoI) that integrates spatial information through attention layers, and Position-Guided Learning (PoG) that uses perception-based supervision to refine object localization.

Result: Experiments show SpatialLock achieves state-of-the-art performance for precise object positioning with IOU scores above 0.9 across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SpatialLock framework successfully enables precise control over object spatial arrangements and improves visual quality in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

### [67] [Tortoise and Hare Guidance: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference with Multirate Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04117)
*Yunghee Lee,Byeonghyun Pak,Junwha Hong,Hoseong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THG is a training-free diffusion sampling acceleration method that treats classifier-free guidance as a multirate ODE system, allowing different integration frequencies for noise estimation (fine grid) and guidance terms (coarse grid), reducing function evaluations by 30% without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional diffusion solvers treat all components equally, failing to exploit the different sensitivity to numerical error between noise estimation and guidance terms, leading to computational redundancy.

Method: Reformulates CFG ODE as multirate system, uses tortoise equation for noise estimation on fine grid and hare equation for guidance on coarse grid, with error-bound-aware timestep sampler and guidance-scale scheduler.

Result: Reduces NFE by up to 30% with minimal fidelity loss (ΔImageReward ≤ 0.032), outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free accelerators under identical computation budgets.

Conclusion: Multirate formulations offer significant potential for diffusion solver optimization, enabling real-time high-quality image synthesis without model retraining.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free diffusion framework for sketch generation that enables precise style control using text prompts and reference sketches, with mechanisms to reduce content leakage and support multi-style generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sketch generation methods lack precise control over sketch styles and often suffer from content leakage when using reference sketches for style transfer.

Method: Uses diffusion models with reference features incorporated as auxiliary information via linear smoothing and style-content guidance, plus a joint AdaIN module for multi-style generation.

Result: Achieves high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment, reduced content leakage, and improved flexibility in style control, especially effective when reference and target sketches have low structural similarity.

Conclusion: The proposed M3S framework provides effective training-free sketch generation with precise style control and multi-style capabilities, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

*Shengyu Tang,Zeyuan Lu,Jiazhi Dong,Changdong Yu,Xiaoyu Wang,Yaohui Lyu,Weihao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMSORT is an efficient dual-branch maritime multi-object tracking method that combines object detection/ReID with camera motion compensation to handle challenging marine environments with camera jitter and visual degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complicated maritime environments cause camera motion and visual degradation, posing significant challenges to multi-object tracking for safe vessel navigation and maritime surveillance.

Method: Parallel tracker with affine compensation featuring: Reversible Columnar Detection Network for robust detection, lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor, camera motion estimation branch that decouples platform/target motion, and clustering-optimized feature fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Singapore Maritime Dataset with fastest runtime among ReID-based MOT frameworks while maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Conclusion: DMSORT provides an efficient and robust solution for maritime multi-object tracking by effectively handling camera motion and visual degradation through its dual-branch architecture.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that enables computer-use agents to learn from online video tutorials at inference time by retrieving, filtering, and converting videos into structured demonstration trajectories, then dynamically selecting relevant guidance during execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer-use agents lag behind humans in tasks requiring domain-specific procedural knowledge about applications and multi-step workflows, while humans can effectively learn from video tutorials by selectively imitating relevant segments.

Method: Proposes a framework that retrieves tutorial videos, converts them into structured trajectories using a VLM to infer UI actions and segment videos into action subsequences with textual objectives, and uses a two-stage selection mechanism to dynamically choose relevant trajectories as in-context guidance during execution.

Result: Experiments on two benchmarks show the framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants using only textual tutorials or transcripts, demonstrating improved performance through video-based guidance.

Conclusion: Online videos can be systematically distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at inference time, with trajectory segmentation/selection, action filtering, and visual information being key factors for success.

Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but
despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially
when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular
applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap
by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short
segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable
computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.
We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts
them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects
trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a
VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,
and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage
selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context
at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its
next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use
only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of
trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual
information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically
distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at
inference time. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB) for evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations and presents a fast rotation classification pipeline that achieves 96% and 92% accuracy on English and Indic datasets, significantly boosting OCR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate rotation correction is essential for enhancing OCR performance in real-world settings where misalignment commonly arises due to user errors during document capture.

Method: Introduced ORB benchmark with English and Indic datasets, and developed a fast rotation classification pipeline using Phi-3.5-Vision model with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned for 4-class rotation classification.

Result: Achieved 96% accuracy on ORB-En and 92% on ORB-Indic datasets. The rotation correction module significantly improved OCR performance: closed-source models by up to 14% and open-weights models by up to 4x.

Conclusion: The proposed rotation classification pipeline is highly effective for document orientation correction and substantially enhances OCR performance across different language datasets and model types.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

*Fatemehzahra Darzi,Rodrigo Escobar Diaz Guerrero,Thomas Bocklitz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study evaluates color transformation techniques for image registration between H&E and multimodal pathology images, finding CycleGAN achieves lowest registration errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate registration of images from different modalities is essential in digital pathology for applications like biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction, but color differences between stains/modalites pose challenges.

Method: Used 20 tissue sample pairs with preprocessing steps including color transformations (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard, Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, normalization, and denoising. Registered using VALIS method with rigid then non-rigid registration. Evaluated using relative Target Registration Error (rTRE).

Result: CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest registration errors in both scenarios (original and inverted multimodal images), while other methods showed higher errors.

Conclusion: Applying color transformation before registration improves alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable analysis in digital pathology.

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Covariance descriptors from pre-trained vision encoders outperform handcrafted features for medical image classification, with SPDNet achieving state-of-the-art performance when combined with DINOv2 features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Covariance descriptors are effective in general computer vision but underexplored in medical imaging. The paper investigates their potential for medical image classification using both conventional and learning-based approaches.

Method: Construct covariance descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders (DINOv2 and MedSAM) and compare with handcrafted descriptors. Evaluate on eleven datasets from MedMNSIT benchmark using SPDNet, a network designed for symmetric positive definite matrices.

Result: Covariance descriptors from GVE features consistently outperform handcrafted features. SPDNet with DINOv2 features achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders shows strong potential for medical image analysis, offering improved classification performance over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for
medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel motion style transfer method using higher-order statistics (skewness and kurtosis) beyond traditional mean and variance, achieving superior performance through Adaptive Statistics Fusor with Style Disentanglement and High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional motion style transfer methods relying only on mean and variance are insufficient to capture complex dynamic patterns and spatiotemporal coherence in motion data, requiring more comprehensive statistical modeling.

Method: Proposed Adaptive Statistics Fusor (AStF) with Style Disentanglement Module and High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention, trained with Motion Consistency Regularization discriminator to incorporate skewness and kurtosis statistics.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over state-of-the-art methods by providing more comprehensive modeling of spatiotemporal statistical patterns.

Conclusion: Incorporating higher-order statistics (skewness and kurtosis) enables more effective motion style transfer by better capturing complex dynamic patterns and spatiotemporal coherence in motion data.

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

TL;DR: MedSapiens adapts human-centric foundation models for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets with significant improvements over both generalist and specialist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of human-centric foundation models for anatomical landmark detection, leveraging their inherent optimization for spatial pose localization as strong priors for medical imaging tasks.

Method: Adapts Sapiens (a human-centric foundation model for pose estimation) to medical imaging through multi-dataset pretraining, creating MedSapiens model.

Result: Achieves up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81% improvement over specialist models in average success detection rate (SDR), with 2.69% improvement in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Human-centric foundation models provide effective priors for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging, establishing new state-of-the-art performance through adaptation rather than novel architecture design.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

*Claudio Giusti,Luca Guarnera,Sebastiano Battiato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proto-LeakNet is an interpretable attribution framework that detects signal leaks in diffusion model outputs for AI-image and deepfake forensics, achieving 98.13% Macro AUC without retraining for unseen generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models has created a critical need for source attribution and authenticity verification, as diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces (signal leaks) in their outputs.

Method: The framework operates in the latent domain of diffusion models, re-simulating partial forward diffusion to expose generator-specific cues. It uses a temporal attention encoder to aggregate multi-step latent features and a feature-weighted prototype head to structure the embedding space for transparent attribution.

Result: Proto-LeakNet achieves a Macro AUC of 98.13%, learns a latent geometry robust under post-processing, surpasses state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong separability between known and unseen generators.

Conclusion: Modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics, demonstrating that diffusion models leave persistent statistical traces that can be leveraged for source attribution.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DinoGRL framework uses DINOv2 to learn gait features for video-based visible-infrared person re-identification, combining silhouette learning with multi-granularity feature enhancement to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VVI-ReID methods focus on modality-invariant visual features but overlook gait features, which are modality-invariant and rich in temporal dynamics, limiting their ability to model spatiotemporal consistency for cross-modal video matching.

Method: Proposed DinoGRL framework with SASGL model for semantic-aware silhouette and gait learning using DINOv2 priors, and PBMGE module for progressive bidirectional multi-granularity enhancement between gait and appearance streams.

Result: Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets demonstrate superiority, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages gait features complementary to appearance cues, achieving robust sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval in VVI-ReID.

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS acceleration methods fail to properly regulate Gaussian numbers during training, causing redundant computational overhead and inefficient training.

Method: Proposes a densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, eliminating the need for budgeting mechanisms to efficiently manage Gaussian importance.

Result: Achieves 3.32× training acceleration vs DashGaussian on Mip-NeRF 360 and 15.45× acceleration vs vanilla 3DGS on Deep Blending, with comparable rendering quality. Shows strong generality across multiple tasks with 2-7× acceleration.

Conclusion: FastGS provides a simple and general acceleration framework that effectively balances training speed and rendering quality through multi-view consistency-based Gaussian regulation.

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration

TL;DR: Domain-specific vision foundation model for herbicide trials outperforms general-purpose models in species identification and damage classification, especially under unseen conditions, while reducing annotation requirements by 80%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose vision models have limited performance in agriculture where fine-grained distinctions between plant species and herbicide damage types are critical for herbicide field trials.

Method: Adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model using self-supervised learning on a large curated agricultural dataset to learn domain-specific representations optimized for herbicide trial images.

Result: Significant improvements in species identification (F1: 0.91→0.94) and damage classification (0.26→0.33); greater gains under unseen conditions (species: 0.56→0.66, damage: 0.17→0.27); maintains performance in domain-shift scenarios like drone imagery (0.49→0.60).

Conclusion: Domain-specific foundation models offer superior generalization capabilities and can significantly reduce manual annotation efforts by 80%, providing a scalable automated solution for herbicide trial analysis.

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

*Robin Spanier,Thorsten Hoeser,Claudia Kuenzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study uses synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery to train YOLOv10 models for offshore infrastructure detection, demonstrating improved performance and geographic transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expansion of marine infrastructure requires effective monitoring systems, but current detection models struggle with scarce and unbalanced datasets, especially for underrepresented object classes.

Method: Trained YOLOv10 object detection models using synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery from four regions, then evaluated geographic transferability on three unseen regions using region-holdout evaluation.

Result: Detected 3,529 offshore platforms across three test regions with F1 score of 0.85, which improved to 0.90 with synthetic data. The model successfully generalized beyond training areas.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation effectively addresses dataset imbalance challenges in remote sensing and enables globally transferable offshore infrastructure detection using deep learning.

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE-T2V integrates prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single step using a Rephrasing Adapter, enabling text-to-video models to generate higher quality videos from concise prompts by better understanding user intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video diffusion models struggle with maintaining video quality when given concise prompts due to limited textual semantics understanding, and cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions.

Method: Proposes RISE-T2V framework with a Rephrasing Adapter that uses text hidden states during LLM's next token prediction as condition for video generation, implicitly rephrasing basic prompts into comprehensive representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show RISE-T2V is versatile across different video diffusion model architectures, significantly enhancing T2V models' ability to generate high-quality videos aligned with user intent.

Conclusion: RISE-T2V provides a universal framework that can be applied to various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models, improving their capabilities for text-to-video tasks by better understanding and aligning with user intentions.

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

*Saúl Alonso-Monsalve,Leigh H. Whitehead,Adam Aurisano,Lorena Escudero Sanchez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a two-stage method using voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks for automated 3D tumor segmentation in CT scans, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with significant computational efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tumor delineation in radiological images is time-consuming and specialized, creating a bottleneck for clinical quantitative analysis. Current methods face impracticality with 3D scans due to computational constraints, requiring downsampling or patching.

Method: Two-stage approach combining voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks, enabling high-resolution 3D segmentation while reducing computational demands.

Result: Achieved competitive results on KiTS23 renal cancer dataset: 95.8% Dice for kidneys+masses, 85.7% for tumors+cysts, 80.3% for tumors alone. Computational improvements: 60% reduction in inference time and 75% reduction in VRAM usage compared to dense architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient high-resolution 3D tumor segmentation with state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational resource requirements, making automated tumor segmentation more practical for clinical applications.

Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed
Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a
bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the
clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated
segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has
driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the
impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,
usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when
applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,
in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,
voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method
allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native
3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while
significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU
memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context
of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23
challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge
winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%
for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also
offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction
in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an
equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.

### [85] [Evaluating the Impact of Weather-Induced Sensor Occlusion on BEVFusion for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04347)
*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEVFusion architecture evaluated for 3D object detection under sensor occlusions. Camera occlusions cause 41.3% mAP drop, LiDAR drops 47.3% under heavy occlusion. Fusion shows stronger reliance on LiDAR (26.8% drop vs 4.1% for camera occlusion).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the impact of sensor occlusions (camera and LiDAR) on 3D object detection accuracy in BEV-based fusion architectures, as effects of environmental conditions like fog, haze, or obstructions remain underexplored.

Method: Used BEVFusion architecture evaluated on nuScenes dataset, measuring detection performance using mAP and NDS metrics under simulated camera and LiDAR occlusions.

Result: Camera-only detection drops 41.3% mAP under moderate occlusion; LiDAR drops 47.3% under heavy occlusion; fused detection shows minor 4.1% drop with camera occlusion but 26.8% drop with LiDAR occlusion, revealing stronger reliance on LiDAR.

Conclusion: BEVFusion model relies more heavily on LiDAR for 3D detection, highlighting need for occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques to handle partial sensor degradation in adverse conditions.

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional chemometric methods struggle to efficiently extract spatial information from imaging data, and while deep learning offers enhanced capabilities, adoption in analytical chemistry is limited due to lack of structured implementation guidance.

Method: Provides MATLAB code tutorials demonstrating how to use existing open-source deep learning models to extract deep features from various imaging modalities, focusing on feature extraction rather than model training.

Result: The tutorial enables analytical chemists to process imaging data from different modalities and integrate spatial information with other data sources like spectral information.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between advanced deep learning capabilities and practical implementation in analytical chemistry by providing accessible, step-by-step guidance for extracting spatial features from imaging data.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates NLP tokenization models for assembly code analysis, examining intrinsic properties like vocabulary size and semantic coverage, and their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis but remains underexplored, with its impact on vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and downstream task performance not well understood.

Method: Systematic evaluation of various tokenization models using intrinsic metrics (tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, representational fidelity) and extrinsic evaluation with pre-trained models (Llama 3.2, BERT, BART) on assembly code tasks.

Result: Tokenizer choice significantly influences downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete predictability of extrinsic outcomes. Complex trade-offs exist between intrinsic tokenizer properties and practical utility.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for optimizing tokenization models in assembly code analysis, contributing to more robust and scalable NLM-based binary analysis workflows.

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.
