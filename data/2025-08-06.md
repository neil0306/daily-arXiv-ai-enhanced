### [1] [Clinically Grounded Agent-based Report Evaluation: An Interpretable Metric for Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02808)
*Radhika Dua,Young Joon,Kwon,Siddhant Dogra,Daniel Freedman,Diana Ruan,Motaz Nashawaty,Danielle Rigau,Daniel Alexander Alber,Kang Zhang,Kyunghyun Cho,Eric Karl Oermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICARE is an interpretable framework for evaluating radiology reports using LLM agents and MCQA, outperforming existing metrics in clinical alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for radiology report evaluation lack interpretability and clinical relevance, necessitating a more reliable method.

Method: ICARE uses two LLM agents to generate and answer clinically meaningful questions, comparing agreement between ground-truth and generated reports.

Result: ICARE aligns better with expert judgment, shows sensitivity to clinical content, and provides interpretable error patterns.

Conclusion: ICARE offers a transparent and clinically grounded approach for evaluating radiology reports, improving reliability and interpretability.

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and
clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred
interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment
requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics
often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking
interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded
Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework
leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated
report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement
on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as
interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to
question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment.
Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment
than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical
content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error
patterns.

### [2] [Modeling Annotator Disagreement with Demographic-Aware Experts and Synthetic Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02853)
*Yinuo Xu,Veronica Derricks,Allison Earl,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEM-MoE models annotator disagreement in NLP tasks using demographic-aware routing and synthetic data imputation, improving diversity representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing annotator disagreement and sparse demographic coverage in subjective NLP tasks to better represent diverse perspectives.

Method: DEM-MoE routes inputs to expert subnetworks based on annotator demographics and uses LLM-generated synthetic annotations for data imputation.

Result: DEM-MoE performs well across demographic groups, especially in high-disagreement datasets, and synthetic data aligns moderately with human annotations.

Conclusion: The approach improves diversity representation, with optimal data-blending strategies depending on dataset structure.

Abstract: We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP
tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model,
DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert
subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent
structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE
consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows
especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To
address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic
annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We
show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on
our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then
propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using
strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies
depend on dataset structure. Together, these contributions improve the
representation of diverse perspectives.

### [3] [Highlight & Summarize: RAG without the jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02872)
*Giovanni Cherubin,Andrew Paverd*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to prevent jailbreaking and model hijacking in LLMs by avoiding direct exposure of user questions to the generative model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against malicious prompts in LLMs are probabilistic and easily bypassed. H&S aims to prevent attacks by design, ensuring safer interactions.

Method: H&S splits the RAG pipeline into a highlighter (extracts relevant passages) and a summarizer (generates answers from highlights), avoiding direct question exposure to the LLM.

Result: H&S responses, especially with an LLM-based highlighter, often outperform standard RAG in correctness, relevance, and quality.

Conclusion: H&S provides a robust, attack-resistant alternative to traditional RAG systems, improving safety and response quality.

Abstract: Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a
chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM
to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its
intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on
hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to
detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these
probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large
space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and
evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by
design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline
(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant
sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This
is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which
takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from
the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages
and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible
instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of
correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an
LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better
than those of a standard RAG pipeline.

### [4] [Merge-based syntax is mediated by distinct neurocognitive mechanisms: A clustering analysis of comprehension abilities in 84,000 individuals with language deficits across nine languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02885)
*Elliot Murphy,Rohan Venkatesh,Edward Khokhlovich,Andrey Vyshedskiy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the computational operation 'Merge' in syntax, identifying three distinct cognitive mechanisms for processing different Merge-based linguistic structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the elementary operation 'Merge' in syntax is supported by distinct neurocognitive mechanisms for different linguistic constructions.

Method: Systematic study of participants' comprehension of sentences with varying syntactic complexity, using clustering analyses to identify behavioral patterns.

Result: Behavioral evidence revealed three distinct structural types, suggesting different cognitive mechanisms for processing Merge-based objects.

Conclusion: While 'Merge' may have emerged suddenly in evolution, distinct cognitive mechanisms likely underpin the processing of various Merge-based linguistic structures.

Abstract: In the modern language sciences, the core computational operation of syntax,
'Merge', is defined as an operation that combines two linguistic units (e.g.,
'brown', 'cat') to form a categorized structure ('brown cat', a Noun Phrase).
This can then be further combined with additional linguistic units based on
this categorial information, respecting non-associativity such that abstract
grouping is respected. Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an
elementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step.
From a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge
may be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions
(e.g., "eat apples"); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns ("red boat"); and
(3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions ("laptop behind the sofa").
Here, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences
with increasing levels of syntactic complexity. Clustering analyses revealed
behavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, which we discuss as
potentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective
impairment. While a Merge-based syntax may still have emerged suddenly in
evolutionary time, responsible for the structured symbolic turn our species
took, different cognitive mechanisms seem to underwrite the processing of
various types of Merge-based objects.

### [5] [Coherent Multimodal Reasoning with Iterative Self-Evaluation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02886)
*Wenjie Luo,Ruocheng Li,Shanshan Zhu,Julian Perry*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Coherent Multimodal Reasoning Framework (CMRF) to enhance cross-modal common sense reasoning in LVLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs lack deep, deliberative thinking for complex reasoning tasks, relying on superficial associations instead of chained inference.

Method: CMRF uses an iterative, self-evaluating mechanism with three modules: Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU), Contextual Inference Engine (CIE), and Coherence Assessment Module (CAM).

Result: CMRF achieves 69.4% accuracy, outperforming open-source baselines by +2.4 points, especially in complex reasoning.

Conclusion: CMRF's modular design and iterative refinement significantly improve reasoning coherence and accuracy, validated by ablation studies and human evaluations.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, current large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (LVLMs) continue to struggle with complex, multi-step,
cross-modal common sense reasoning tasks, often exhibiting a lack of
"deliberative thinking." They tend to rely on superficial associations rather
than deep, chained inference, particularly when integrating visual information
with abstract concepts. To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal
Reasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense
reasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference
mechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,
generating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework
integrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking
down problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for
contextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating
logical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative
Refinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built
upon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning
(MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
LVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It
attains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline
by +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning
scenarios. Extensive ablation studies and human evaluations confirm the
critical contributions of each module and the effectiveness of iterative
refinement in fostering more coherent and accurate reasoning.

### [6] [SLIM-LLMs: Modeling of Style-Sensory Language RelationshipsThrough Low-Dimensional Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02901)
*Osama Khalid,Sanvesh Srivastava,Padmini Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores sensorial language's link to stylistic features using Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) and introduces SLIM-LLMs for efficient modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how sensorial language relates to traditional stylistic features and improve modeling efficiency.

Method: Uses Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) and introduces SLIM-LLMs for non-linear relationships.

Result: Low-rank LIWC features (r=24) match full feature performance (r=74), reducing parameters by 80%.

Conclusion: SLIM-LLMs with low-rank features efficiently model sensorial language, maintaining performance with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Sensorial language -- the language connected to our senses including vision,
sound, touch, taste, smell, and interoception, plays a fundamental role in how
we communicate experiences and perceptions. We explore the relationship between
sensorial language and traditional stylistic features, like those measured by
LIWC, using a novel Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) approach. We demonstrate
that low-dimensional latent representations of LIWC features r = 24 effectively
capture stylistic information for sensorial language prediction compared to the
full feature set (r = 74). We introduce Stylometrically Lean Interpretable
Models (SLIM-LLMs), which model non-linear relationships between these style
dimensions. Evaluated across five genres, SLIM-LLMs with low-rank LIWC features
match the performance of full-scale language models while reducing parameters
by up to 80%.

*Shengqi Li,Amarnath Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for controlling conversation quality in LLMs using nine parameters across six dimensions, showing significant improvements in dialogue properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in conversation generation like topic coherence, knowledge progression, character consistency, and control granularity.

Method: Parameter-based control framework tested with state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Statistically significant differences in generated conversation properties.

Conclusion: Provides standardized quality control for applications in education, therapy, customer service, and entertainment, with future work on additional parameters and benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a parameterization framework for controlling
conversation quality in large language models. We explore nine key parameters
across six dimensions that enable precise specification of dialogue properties.
Through experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate that
parameter-based control produces statistically significant differences in
generated conversation properties. Our approach addresses challenges in
conversation generation, including topic coherence, knowledge progression,
character consistency, and control granularity. The framework provides a
standardized method for conversation quality control with applications in
education, therapy, customer service, and entertainment. Future work will focus
on implementing additional parameters through architectural modifications and
developing benchmark datasets for evaluation.

### [8] [CoCoTen: Detecting Adversarial Inputs to Large Language Models through Latent Space Features of Contextual Co-occurrence Tensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02997)
*Sri Durga Sai Sowmya Kadali,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method using Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors effectively detects adversarial and jailbreak prompts in LLMs, achieving high accuracy and speed with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of LLMs makes them vulnerable to attacks like jailbreaks, necessitating robust detection methods for safe use.

Method: Leverages latent space characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors to identify adversarial prompts.

Result: Achieves an F1 score of 0.83 with only 0.5% labeled prompts, a 96.6% improvement over baselines, and is significantly faster.

Conclusion: The method is effective and efficient, especially in data-scarce scenarios, and supports future research with public implementation.

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks
a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and
hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially
jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats,
developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use
of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual
Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce
environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space
characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the
effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations
show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of
labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result
highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data
is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to
128.4 times compared to the baseline models. To support future research and
reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available.

### [9] [When Algorithms Meet Artists: Topic Modeling the AI-Art Debate, 2013-2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03037)
*Ariya Mukherjee-Gandhi,Oliver Muellerklein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A 12-year analysis of AI-generated art discourse reveals misalignment between artists' concerns and media narratives, highlighting gatekeeping via technical jargon and advocating for transparency-driven engagement with artists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the marginalization of artists' voices in discussions about AI's impact on creative labor and explore the disconnect between their concerns and dominant narratives.

Method: Analyzed 439 curated 500-word excerpts from diverse sources (2013-2025) using a reproducible methodology, identifying thematic clusters with BERTopic.

Result: Found five stable thematic clusters, revealing gatekeeping through technical jargon and misalignment between artists' urgent issues and media narratives.

Conclusion: Calls for deeper, transparency-driven engagement with artists in AI-creative discourse and provides a BERTopic-based methodology for future research.

Abstract: As generative AI continues to reshape artistic production and alternate modes
of human expression, artists whose livelihoods are most directly affected have
raised urgent concerns about consent, transparency, and the future of creative
labor. However, the voices of artists are often marginalized in dominant public
and scholarly discourse. This study presents a twelve-year analysis, from 2013
to 2025, of English-language discourse surrounding AI-generated art. It draws
from 439 curated 500-word excerpts sampled from opinion articles, news reports,
blogs, legal filings, and spoken-word transcripts. Through a reproducible
methodology, we identify five stable thematic clusters and uncover a
misalignment between artists' perceptions and prevailing media narratives. Our
findings highlight how the use of technical jargon can function as a subtle
form of gatekeeping, often sidelining the very issues artists deem most urgent.
Our work provides a BERTopic-based methodology and a multimodal baseline for
future research, alongside a clear call for deeper, transparency-driven
engagement with artist perspectives in the evolving AI-creative landscape.

### [10] [Privacy-Aware Decoding: Mitigating Privacy Leakage of Large Language Models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03098)
*Haoran Wang,Xiongxiao Xu,Baixiang Huang,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAD introduces a lightweight, inference-time defense for RAG systems to protect sensitive data by injecting calibrated noise into token logits, balancing privacy and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems risk leaking private data during retrieval; PAD aims to mitigate this without retraining or corpus-level changes.

Method: PAD uses confidence-based screening, sensitivity estimation, and context-aware noise calibration, tracked via RDP for explicit privacy guarantees.

Result: PAD reduces private data leakage while maintaining response quality, outperforming existing defenses.

Conclusion: PAD advances privacy protection in RAG systems with a scalable, model-agnostic approach.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large
language models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources.
However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are
susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information
through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a
lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian
noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based
screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity
estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration
to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)
accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit
per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.
Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is
model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving
response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based
defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in
RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy
solutions in sensitive domains. Our code is available:

### [11] [Token-Level Precise Attack on RAG: Searching for the Best Alternatives to Mislead Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03110)
*Zizhong Li,Haopeng Zhang,Jiawei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TPARAG, a token-level attack framework for RAG systems, addressing vulnerabilities in retrieval and generation stages, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security vulnerabilities in RAG systems caused by malicious external content, which prior attacks failed to fully exploit.

Method: Proposes TPARAG, using a lightweight white-box LLM to iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token level for retrievability and attack success.

Result: TPARAG outperforms existing methods in retrieval and end-to-end attack effectiveness on QA datasets.

Conclusion: Reveals critical RAG vulnerabilities and provides insights for improving robustness.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face
critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address
these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs
with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and
real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new
security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external
database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior
work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely
heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval
and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack
on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and
black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an
attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token
level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation.
Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG
consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end
attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in
RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.

### [12] [Cross-lingual Opinions and Emotions Mining in Comparable Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03112)
*Motaz Saad,David Langlois,Kamel Smaili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes sentiment and emotion differences in English-Arabic comparable texts, using cross-lingual methods and bilingual lexicons, finding alignment when sources match and divergence otherwise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how sentiments and emotions vary across topic-aligned but non-translated English-Arabic documents, a gap in prior research.

Method: Annotate texts with sentiment/emotion labels, create bilingual emotion lexicons, and statistically compare alignment in document pairs from different sources.

Result: Sentiment and emotion annotations align for documents from the same news agency but diverge for those from different agencies.

Conclusion: The method is language-independent and applicable to other language pairs, highlighting source influence on sentiment/emotion alignment.

Abstract: Comparable texts are topic-aligned documents in multiple languages that are
not direct translations. They are valuable for understanding how a topic is
discussed across languages. This research studies differences in sentiments and
emotions across English-Arabic comparable documents. First, texts are annotated
with sentiment and emotion labels. We apply a cross-lingual method to label
documents with opinion classes (subjective/objective), avoiding reliance on
machine translation. To annotate with emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy,
sadness, surprise), we manually translate the English WordNet-Affect (WNA)
lexicon into Arabic, creating bilingual emotion lexicons used to label the
comparable corpora. We then apply a statistical measure to assess the agreement
of sentiments and emotions in each source-target document pair. This comparison
is especially relevant when the documents originate from different sources. To
our knowledge, this aspect has not been explored in prior literature. Our study
includes English-Arabic document pairs from Euronews, BBC, and Al-Jazeera
(JSC). Results show that sentiment and emotion annotations align when articles
come from the same news agency and diverge when they come from different ones.
The proposed method is language-independent and generalizable to other language
pairs.

### [13] [Long Story Generation via Knowledge Graph and Literary Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03137)
*Ge Shi,Kaiyu Huang,Guochen Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-agent Story Generator using LLMs to improve long text generation by addressing theme drift and incoherent plots with memory storage and a story theme obstacle framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous outline-based methods suffer from theme drift and incoherent plots, reducing appeal to readers.

Method: Uses LLMs in a multi-agent structure with long/short-term memory storage, a story theme obstacle framework, and multi-agent interaction for revisions.

Result: Generates higher-quality long stories compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses key issues in long text generation, improving story coherence and appeal.

Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a
sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has
addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a
multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach
suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the
loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic
that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to
improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core
components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model
comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most
important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory
storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To
incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle
framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain
factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates
the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by
building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we
establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction
through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it
remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods
demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

*Junyao Yang,Jianwei Wang,Huiping Zhuang,Cen Chen,Ziqian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCP-Merging integrates domain-specific LLMs with long CoT reasoning models, improving domain task performance by ~9% without degrading reasoning capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To merge domain-specific LLMs with long CoT reasoning models efficiently, avoiding capability degradation and output collapse.

Method: Uses reasoning capability as prior, selectively merging domain-specific weights while preserving core CoT capability.

Result: Improves domain task performance by 9.5% and 9.2% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RCP-Merging effectively combines domain knowledge with reasoning capability, maintaining performance in both areas.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability,
termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving
abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability
model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without
substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly
resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer
from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output
collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long
Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning
Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model
performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as
foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to
preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging
essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on
Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance
domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning
model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and
9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original
long CoT reasoning capability.

### [15] [Light-IF: Endowing LLMs with Generalizable Reasoning via Preview and Self-Checking for Complex Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03178)
*Chenyang Wang,Liang Wen,Shousheng Jia,Xiangzheng Zhang,Liang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses inconsistent instruction adherence in LLMs by proposing a framework for rigorous reasoning, including preview and self-checking, leading to improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex instructions due to lazy reasoning during thinking stages, prompting the need for a solution to enhance adherence.

Method: The framework involves generating and filtering complex prompts, rejection sampling, and fine-tuning with entropy-preserving SFT and TEA-RL reinforcement learning.

Result: The Light-IF-32B model outperforms larger open-source and closed-source models on instruction-following benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves LLMs' reasoning and instruction adherence, demonstrating scalability and superiority over existing models.

Abstract: While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly
enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and
general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions
remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our
investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the
primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this
issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous
reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for
satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate
instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain
valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard,
easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to
curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization
of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns.
Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning
(Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL)
reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach
encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering
generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.

TL;DR: Analysis of 28,000 Bundestag speeches using ML models for topic and sentiment classification reveals party-specific discourse strategies and the impact of governing roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand political discourse trends, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific strategies in the German parliament.

Method: Developed and trained ML models for topic and sentiment classification on manually labeled data, achieving high AUROC scores (0.94 for topics, 0.89 for sentiment).

Result: Models identified topic trends and sentiment distributions, showing how governing roles influence discourse styles and party relationships.

Conclusion: Governing responsibilities and ideological positions shape discourse, with observable shifts when parties move between government and opposition roles.

Abstract: This study investigates political discourse in the German parliament, the
Bundestag, by analyzing approximately 28,000 parliamentary speeches from the
last five years. Two machine learning models for topic and sentiment
classification were developed and trained on a manually labeled dataset. The
models showed strong classification performance, achieving an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 for topic
classification (average across topics) and 0.89 for sentiment classification.
Both models were applied to assess topic trends and sentiment distributions
across political parties and over time. The analysis reveals remarkable
relationships between parties and their role in parliament. In particular, a
change in style can be observed for parties moving from government to
opposition. While ideological positions matter, governing responsibilities also
shape discourse. The analysis directly addresses key questions about the
evolution of topics, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific discourse
strategies in the Bundestag.

*Muhammed Saeed,Shaina Raza,Ashmal Vayani,Muhammad Abdul-Mageed,Ali Emami,Shady Shehata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how grammatical gender in languages influences visual representation in Text-to-Image (T2I) models, revealing significant biases in gender representation based on linguistic structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the overlooked impact of grammatical gender on visual outputs in T2I models, beyond demographic and stereotypical biases.

Method: A cross-linguistic benchmark was created with 800 prompts in five gendered and two gender-neutral languages, generating 28,800 images across three T2I models.

Result: Grammatical gender strongly affects image generation, with masculine markers increasing male representation (73%) and feminine markers increasing female representation (38%). Effects vary by language resource and model architecture.

Conclusion: Language structure, not just content, shapes AI-generated visuals, adding a new dimension to understanding bias and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.

Abstract: Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on
demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a
fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual
representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark
examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender
associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but
referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset
spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and
two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique
prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models.
Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image
generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\%
on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine
grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in
English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability
and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects.
Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes
AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias
and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of anonymizing private data in large language models and reviews pre-processing approaches for domain-agnostic NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy is a fundamental right, and regulations like GDPR protect it. However, large language models often use data containing private information, making anonymization crucial.

Method: The report reviews various pre-processing approaches for masking or pseudonymizing private information in textual data.

Result: While complete anonymization may not be possible, several methods exist to address privacy concerns in NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Anonymizing private data in NLP is essential, and the paper highlights domain-agnostic approaches to achieve this.

Abstract: Privacy is a fundamental human right. Data privacy is protected by different
regulations, such as GDPR. However, modern large language models require a huge
amount of data to learn linguistic variations, and the data often contains
private information. Research has shown that it is possible to extract private
information from such language models. Thus, anonymizing such private and
sensitive information is of utmost importance. While complete anonymization may
not be possible, a number of different pre-processing approaches exist for
masking or pseudonymizing private information in textual data. This report
focuses on a few of such approaches for domain-agnostic NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Structural probes in LLMs are biased by word proximity, struggle with deep syntax, and are unaffected by word predictability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if structural and statistical factors systematically affect syntactic representations in LLMs.

Method: Analyzed structural probes on three controlled benchmarks.

Result: Probes are biased by word proximity, perform poorly on deep syntax, and are unaffected by word predictability.

Conclusion: Highlights challenges for structural probes and proposes controlled benchmarks for better evaluation.

Abstract: The syntactic structures of sentences can be readily read-out from the
activations of large language models (LLMs). However, the ``structural probes''
that have been developed to reveal this phenomenon are typically evaluated on
an indiscriminate set of sentences. Consequently, it remains unclear whether
structural and/or statistical factors systematically affect these syntactic
representations. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are three-fold.
First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two
words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them
as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic
properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered
by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do
not appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words. Overall,
this work sheds light on the current challenges faced by structural probes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs fail to replicate cultural depression symptom patterns in English prompts but improve with Eastern languages. Issues include low cultural persona sensitivity and a dominant symptom hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if LLMs reproduce cultural differences in depression symptom reporting, as seen in clinical psychology.

Method: Prompting LLMs with Western or Eastern personas in English and Eastern languages (Chinese, Japanese, Hindi).

Result: LLMs largely fail in English but show better alignment in Eastern languages. Key issues: low cultural sensitivity and a strong symptom hierarchy.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack robust culture-awareness for safe mental health use, despite prompt language importance.

Abstract: Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with
depression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals
report somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
increasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by
prompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely
fail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in
major Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment
in several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this
failure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong,
culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These
findings reveal that while prompt language is important, current
general-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for
safe and effective mental health applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RooseBERT is a domain-specific pre-trained Language Model for political discourse, outperforming general-purpose models in tasks like named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and argument analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Political debates are complex and require specialized computational methods for analysis, as general-purpose models struggle with the nuances of political language.

Method: RooseBERT is pre-trained on large-scale political debate corpora (8K debates) and fine-tuned on four downstream tasks: named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument component detection, and argument relation prediction.

Result: RooseBERT shows significant improvements over general-purpose models in all four tasks, proving the value of domain-specific pre-training.

Conclusion: RooseBERT enhances political debate analysis and is released for research use, demonstrating the effectiveness of specialized pre-training in this domain.

Abstract: The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions
calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically
analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political
deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language
and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication
strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging,
even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this
issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse
language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised
domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring
extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been
trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed
of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its
performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political
debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument
component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and
classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over
general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how
domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis.
We release the RooseBERT language model for the research community.

*Duzhen Zhang,Chenxing Li,Jiahua Dong,Qi Liu,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method for Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) to balance retaining old knowledge and acquiring new knowledge, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNER methods overly prioritize stability (retaining old knowledge) via Knowledge Distillation, limiting plasticity (learning new knowledge).

Method: SPT balances stability and plasticity through representation consolidation (pooling in KD) and dynamic weight merging with a selective mechanism. It also uses confidence-based pseudo-labeling for non-entity types.

Result: SPT outperforms previous CNER methods in ten settings across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SPT effectively addresses the stability-plasticity trade-off in CNER, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is an evolving field that focuses
on sequentially updating an existing model to incorporate new entity types.
Previous CNER methods primarily utilize Knowledge Distillation (KD) to preserve
prior knowledge and overcome catastrophic forgetting, strictly ensuring that
the representations of old and new models remain consistent. Consequently, they
often impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old
knowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To
address this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method
for CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight
perspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling
operation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by
consolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we
dynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old
knowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a
weight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover,
we develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current
non-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the
semantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has
largely been ignored by previous methods. Extensive experiments across ten CNER
settings on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method surpasses
previous CNER approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving a
suitable stability-plasticity trade-off.

TL;DR: LLMs' ability to predict human economic decisions was tested using real data, showing limited individual accuracy but reasonable group-level trends. Prompting methods had minimal impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' capacity to simulate human economic behavior using real human data, addressing the reliance on fictional personas in prior studies.

Method: Compared three multimodal LLMs using 522 Korean participants' data in Pay-What-You-Want pricing experiments, testing persona injection methods.

Result: LLMs struggled with individual predictions but showed reasonable group-level tendencies. Prompting techniques offered no significant improvement over naive methods.

Conclusion: LLMs can simulate group-level economic behavior but lack precision for individual predictions, providing empirical insights for computational social science.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant
interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies
rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this
limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic
decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real
522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art
multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants
in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately
replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect
prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise
individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level
behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting
techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of
personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain
against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the
first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic
behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based
simulation in computational social science.

TL;DR: LECTOR is a new adaptive scheduling algorithm for test-oriented learning, using LLMs for semantic analysis and personalized profiles, outperforming baselines with a 90.2% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spaced repetition systems struggle with semantic interference and lack personalized adaptation, especially in language learning.

Method: LECTOR combines LLM-powered semantic similarity assessment with spaced repetition principles for adaptive scheduling.

Result: LECTOR achieves a 90.2% success rate, a 2.0% improvement over the best baseline (SSP-MMC), and excels in handling semantic confusion.

Conclusion: LECTOR is effective for intelligent tutoring and adaptive learning, particularly in language test scenarios.

Abstract: Spaced repetition systems are fundamental to efficient learning and memory
retention, but existing algorithms often struggle with semantic interference
and personalized adaptation. We present LECTOR (\textbf{L}LM-\textbf{E}nhanced
\textbf{C}oncept-based \textbf{T}est-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}epetition), a
novel adaptive scheduling algorithm specifically designed for test-oriented
learning scenarios, particularly language examinations where success rate is
paramount. LECTOR leverages large language models for semantic analysis while
incorporating personalized learning profiles, addressing the critical challenge
of semantic confusion in vocabulary learning by utilizing LLM-powered semantic
similarity assessment and integrating it with established spaced repetition
principles. Our comprehensive evaluation against six baseline algorithms
(SSP-MMC, SM2, HLR, FSRS, ANKI, THRESHOLD) across 100 simulated learners over
100 days demonstrates significant improvements: LECTOR achieves a 90.2\%
success rate compared to 88.4\% for the best baseline (SSP-MMC), representing a
2.0\% relative improvement. The algorithm shows particular strength in handling
semantically similar concepts, reducing confusion-induced errors while
maintaining computational efficiency. Our results establish LECTOR as a
promising direction for intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning
platforms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit linguistic convergence, adapting to users' linguistic patterns. It compares model completions to human responses across models, corpora, and features, finding strong but often overfitting convergence, with differences based on model type and size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs adapt to human-like linguistic patterns, a key aspect of pragmatic communication, and how this behavior compares to human convergence.

Method: Systematic comparison of model completions to human responses across 16 models, 3 dialogue corpora, and various stylometric features.

Result: Models strongly converge to conversation styles, often overfitting. Instruction-tuned and larger models converge less than pretrained ones. Human and model convergence mechanisms likely differ.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit linguistic convergence but differ from humans in mechanisms and patterns, with model type and size influencing the degree of convergence.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are generally considered proficient in
generating language, how similar their language usage is to that of humans
remains understudied. In this paper, we test whether models exhibit linguistic
convergence, a core pragmatic element of human language communication, asking:
do models adapt, or converge, to the linguistic patterns of their user? To
answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues
to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue
corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly
converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative
to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,
we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with
instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained
counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence
patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are
very different.

*Shahed Masoudian,Gustavo Escobedo,Hannah Strauss,Markus Schedl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates gender bias in LLMs using psychological stereotypes in narrative generation, revealing biases and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about LLMs amplifying gender biases, especially in implicit forms during generative tasks, motivate this study.

Method: Uses the StereoBias-Stories dataset with narrative generation tasks conditioned on psychological stereotypes to analyze gender bias.

Result: Findings include bias mitigation with neutral attributes, intensified bias with stereotype-aligned attributes, and stronger alignment in larger models.

Conclusion: Psychology-grounded evaluation is crucial for understanding and addressing gender bias in LLMs.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different
applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in
various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using
explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion
and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit
forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,
we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in
psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of
narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories
containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or
six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related
story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story
changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)
While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned
prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes
mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same
gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias
and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological
ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with
model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of
psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMs outperform professors in estimating exam question difficulty, with supervised learning using LLM uncertainty yielding the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Professors struggle to accurately estimate exam question difficulty, impacting exam quality.

Method: Compared LLM-based methods (including Gemini 2.5) with professors, using supervised learning with LLM uncertainty on 42 training samples.

Result: Professors were outperformed by LLMs, with supervised learning using LLM uncertainty achieving the best performance.

Conclusion: Supervised learning with LLM uncertainty can improve professors' ability to estimate exam question difficulty, enhancing assessment quality.

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good
exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various
Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to
estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False
exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our
results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between
easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking
Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using
uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning
setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning
using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of
exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

*Anqi Li,Wenwei Jin,Jintao Tong,Pengda Qin,Weijia Li,Guo Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hi-Guard is a multimodal moderation framework that improves accuracy and interpretability by aligning with moderation policies and using hierarchical classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current moderation systems lack alignment with rules and produce opaque decisions, hindering human review.

Method: Hi-Guard uses a hierarchical pipeline (binary filtering + fine-grained classification) and incorporates rule definitions into prompts. It also employs multi-level soft-margin rewards and GRPO for optimization.

Result: Hi-Guard achieves superior accuracy, generalization, and interpretability in experiments and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Hi-Guard offers a scalable, transparent, and trustworthy solution for content safety.

Abstract: Social platforms have revolutionized information sharing, but also
accelerated the dissemination of harmful and policy-violating content. To
ensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond
efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches
largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation
rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we
propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that
introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term "Hierarchical"
reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation
pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a
stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical
taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based
classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained
levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard
directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further
enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level
soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation
quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that
Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and
interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy
content safety systems. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS) to enhance LLMs by leveraging multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration, outperforming single-agent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods are limited by single-agent paradigms, while collective-agent approaches show potential for superior performance.

Method: Three CTTS paradigms (SA-MR, MA-SR, MA-MR) are explored, with MA-MR identified as optimal. A framework, CTTS-MM, is proposed, incorporating Agent Collaboration Search (ACS) and Mixture of Reward Models (MoR).

Result: MA-MR consistently performs best. CTTS-MM achieves superior results across seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: CTTS-MM effectively combines multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration, setting a new standard for test-time scaling in LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for
enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra
training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and
Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model
(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling
(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that
collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent
systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first
step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the
different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three
primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent
to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model
(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.
Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively
leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced
inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent
Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination
of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model
collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a
curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to
select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking
(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that
the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be
released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

TL;DR: Taggus pipeline extracts social networks from Portuguese fiction using POS tagging and heuristics, outperforming existing tools with F1-scores of 94.1% (character identification) and 75.9% (interaction detection).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLP methods (e.g., NER) underperform for constructing character social networks, especially in less-represented languages like Portuguese due to lack of annotated data.

Method: Proposes Taggus, a pipeline combining POS tagging and heuristics for character and interaction extraction in Portuguese fiction.

Result: Achieves F1-scores of 94.1% (character identification) and 75.9% (interaction detection), outperforming state-of-the-art tools by 50.7% and 22.3%.

Conclusion: Taggus shows promise for Portuguese fiction analysis; future work includes improving relationship detection and expanding testing samples.

Abstract: Automatically identifying characters and their interactions from fiction
books is, arguably, a complex task that requires pipelines that leverage
multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, such as Named Entity
Recognition (NER) and Part-of-speech (POS) tagging. However, these methods are
not optimized for the task that leads to the construction of Social Networks of
Characters. Indeed, the currently available methods tend to underperform,
especially in less-represented languages, due to a lack of manually annotated
data for training. Here, we propose a pipeline, which we call Taggus, to
extract social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. Our results
show that compared to readily available State-of-the-Art tools -- off-the-shelf
NER tools and Large Language Models (ChatGPT) -- the resulting pipeline, which

with an average F1-Score of $94.1\%$ in the task of identifying characters and
solving for co-reference and $75.9\%$ in interaction detection. These
represent, respectively, an increase of $50.7\%$ and $22.3\%$ on results
achieved by the readily available State-of-the-Art tools. Further steps to
improve results are outlined, such as solutions for detecting relationships
between characters. Limitations on the size and scope of our testing samples

### [32] [Thinking with Nothinking Calibration: A New In-Context Learning Paradigm in Reasoning Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03363)
*Haotian Wu,Bo Xu,Yao Shu,Menglin Yang,Chengwei Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces JointThinking, a new in-context learning (ICL) paradigm for reasoning large language models (RLLMs), leveraging the difference between Thinking and Nothinking modes to improve accuracy with minimal latency overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research has focused on training and inference strategies for RLLMs, leaving their ICL potential underexplored. This work aims to bridge that gap.

Method: JointThinking prompts the model to generate two answers (Thinking and Nothinking modes) and triggers a second round of Thinking only if the answers disagree, using a single prompt.

Result: JointThinking outperforms few-shot chain-of-thought and majority voting, achieves comparable in-distribution performance to SOTA, and excels in out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong scalability and lowers error rates by leveraging reasoning diversity, with future research directions outlined.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research
has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,
their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To
fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),
a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two
reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.
Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:
one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of
Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,
using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both
candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\%
in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,
resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms
few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer
robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to
training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on
out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the
calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes
consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural
thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between
actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round
of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we
discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL
research in RLLMs.

### [33] [ReDSM5: A Reddit Dataset for DSM-5 Depression Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03399)
*Eliseo Bao,Anxo Pérez,Javier Parapar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReDSM5 is a novel Reddit corpus annotated for DSM-5 depression symptoms at the sentence level, enabling interpretable and clinically relevant depression detection models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many depression cases go undiagnosed due to clinical barriers and stigma. Social media data, like Reddit posts, can reveal early signs, but existing methods lack DSM-5 symptom-specific analysis.

Method: ReDSM5 includes 1484 Reddit posts annotated by a psychologist for DSM-5 symptoms, with clinical rationales. Exploratory analysis examines linguistic and emotional patterns.

Result: The corpus supports multi-label symptom classification and explanation generation, providing baseline benchmarks for future research.

Conclusion: ReDSM5 bridges the gap between computational detection and clinical interpretability, aiding in more accurate and explainable depression diagnosis.

Abstract: Depression is a pervasive mental health condition that affects hundreds of
millions of individuals worldwide, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to
barriers in traditional clinical access and pervasive stigma. Social media
platforms, and Reddit in particular, offer rich, user-generated narratives that
can reveal early signs of depressive symptomatology. However, existing
computational approaches often label entire posts simply as depressed or not
depressed, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the
standard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both
clinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
ReDSM5, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each
exhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the
nine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a
concise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an
exploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and
emotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media
narratives. Compared to prior resources, ReDSM5 uniquely combines
symptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, facilitating the
development of models that not only detect depression but also generate
human-interpretable reasoning. We establish baseline benchmarks for both
multi-label symptom classification and explanation generation, providing
reference results for future research on detection and interpretability.

### [34] [Variety Is the Spice of Life: Detecting Misinformation with Dynamic Environmental Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03420)
*Bing Wang,Ximing Li,Yiming Wang,Changchun Li,Jiaxu Cui,Renchu Guan,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MISDER, a dynamic framework for misinformation detection, addressing the limitations of static methods by incorporating evolving social environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation detection is crucial due to its harmful effects, but existing static methods fail to account for dynamic real-world scenarios where news veracity fluctuates.

Method: MISDER learns social environmental representations over time and uses temporal models (LSTM, ODE, pre-trained dynamics) to predict future representations. Three variants are proposed: MISDER-LSTM, MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT.

Result: Experiments on two datasets show MISDER outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: MISDER provides a robust solution for dynamic misinformation detection, adapting to evolving social contexts.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation across diverse social media platforms has
drawn significant attention from both academic and industrial communities due
to its detrimental effects. Accordingly, automatically distinguishing
misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an
increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a
static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links,
and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels.
However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world
scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically
evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental
Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social
environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to
predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the
temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained
dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM,
MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER,
we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the
experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

### [35] [LLMs Have a Heart of Stone: Demystifying the Soft Thinking Ability of Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03440)
*Junhong Wu,Jinliang Lu,Zixuan Ren,Ganqiang Hu,Zhi Wu,Dai Dai,Hua Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates 'Soft Thinking' in LLMs, revealing their tendency to rely on dominant soft inputs, limiting reasoning path exploration. Introducing randomness via methods like Dirichlet resampling and Gumbel-Softmax improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning models use discrete tokens, limiting expressive capabilities. The study aims to enhance LLMs' ability to reason in continuous concept spaces.

Method: Probing techniques analyze LLMs' internal behavior. Sampling strategies (Dirichlet resampling, Gumbel-Softmax) introduce randomness to improve reasoning.

Result: LLMs favor dominant soft inputs, reducing Soft Thinking to greedy decoding. Randomness methods, especially Gumbel-Softmax, enhance performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating randomness in Soft Thinking mitigates limitations, unlocking its potential, with Gumbel-Softmax showing superior results.

Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas
existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially
constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address
this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,
abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.
This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by
examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.
Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous
exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs
predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during
subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different
reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,
obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.
To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce
\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the
Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness
can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential
of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate
randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across
eight reasoning benchmarks.

### [36] [Cropping outperforms dropout as an augmentation strategy for training self-supervised text embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03453)
*Rita González-Márquez,Philipp Berens,Dmitry Kobak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised fine-tuning for text embeddings using cropping augmentation outperforms dropout-based methods, nearing supervised SOTA for in-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current top-performing text embedding models rely on supervised fine-tuning, unlike computer vision where self-supervised methods excel. This paper explores self-supervised approaches for text embeddings.

Method: Systematic comparison of two augmentation strategies (cropping vs. dropout) in contrastive learning for text embeddings, evaluated on MTEB and in-domain datasets.

Result: Cropping augmentation outperforms dropout, with in-domain results close to supervised SOTA. Out-of-domain performance lags. Fine-tuning last transformer layers suffices for quality embeddings.

Conclusion: Self-supervised fine-tuning with cropping is effective for in-domain text embeddings, reducing reliance on supervised data and computational resources.

Abstract: Text embeddings, i.e. vector representations of entire texts, play an
important role in many NLP applications, such as retrieval-augmented
generation, sentiment analysis, clustering, or visualizing collections of texts
for data exploration. Currently, top-performing embedding models are derived
from pre-trained language models via extensive supervised fine-tuning using
curated text pairs. This contrasts with computer vision, where self-supervised
training based on data augmentations has demonstrated remarkable success. Here
we systematically compare the two most well-known augmentation strategies for
positive pair generation in contrastive learning of text embeddings. We assess
embedding quality on MTEB and additional in-domain evaluations and show that
cropping augmentation strongly outperforms the dropout-based approach. We find
that on out-of-domain data, the quality of resulting embeddings is below the
supervised SOTA models, but for in-domain data, self-supervised fine-tuning
produces high-quality text embeddings after very short fine-tuning, sometimes
only marginally below the supervised SOTA. Finally, we show that representation
quality increases towards the last transformer layers, which undergo the
largest change during fine-tuning; and that fine-tuning only those last layers
is sufficient to reach similar embedding quality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CarbonPDF-QA, a dataset for analyzing carbon footprint questions in PDF sustainability reports, and proposes CarbonPDF, an LLM-based method that outperforms existing QA systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unstructured and inconsistent nature of text in PDF sustainability reports complicates carbon footprint analysis, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: The authors develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama 3 with their dataset (CarbonPDF-QA) to address inconsistencies in PDF-parsed text.

Result: CarbonPDF outperforms state-of-the-art QA systems, including those fine-tuned on table and text data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively tackles the challenges of analyzing unstructured PDF reports, offering a robust solution for carbon footprint questions.

Abstract: Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the
environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format.
These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates
their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting
formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting
relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle
the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within
sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our
focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and
inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this
analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing
question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with
human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer
questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose
CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon
footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama
3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms
current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems
finetuned on table and text data.

*Md Rakibul Hasan,Md Zakir Hossain,Aneesh Krishna,Shafin Rahman,Tom Gedeon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UPLME, an uncertainty-aware probabilistic language model, improves empathy regression by addressing noisy labels, outperforming existing methods in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning for empathy regression suffers from noisy self-reported scores, with limited solutions for regression settings.

Method: UPLME uses a probabilistic language model to predict empathy scores and uncertainty, trained with Bayesian variational ensembling and novel loss components for UQ and input similarity.

Result: UPLME achieves state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Correlation: 0.580, 0.634) and better calibration (error: 0.376) in noisy benchmarks.

Conclusion: UPLME effectively handles label noise in empathy regression, demonstrating superior performance and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Supervised learning for empathy regression is challenged by noisy
self-reported empathy scores. While many algorithms have been proposed for
learning with noisy labels in textual classification problems, the regression
counterpart is relatively under-explored. We propose UPLME, an
uncertainty-aware probabilistic language modelling framework to capture label
noise in the regression setting of empathy detection. UPLME includes a
probabilistic language model that predicts both empathy score and
heteroscedastic uncertainty and is trained using Bayesian concepts with
variational model ensembling. We further introduce two novel loss components:
one penalises degenerate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and another enforces
the similarity between the input pairs on which we predict empathy. UPLME
provides state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
$0.558\rightarrow0.580$ and $0.629\rightarrow0.634$) in terms of the
performance reported in the literature in two public benchmarks, having label
noise. Through synthetic label noise injection, we show that UPLME is effective
in separating noisy and clean samples based on the predicted uncertainty. UPLME
further outperform (Calibration error: $0.571\rightarrow0.376$) a recent
variational model ensembling-based UQ method designed for regression problems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FilBench is introduced to evaluate LLMs in Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano, revealing gaps in reading comprehension and translation. GPT-4o scores highest at 72.23%, while SEA-LION v3 70B, a Southeast Asian model, underperforms at 61.07%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM capabilities in Filipino languages and address the lack of benchmarks for Philippine languages.

Method: FilBench is curated with tasks reflecting Filipino NLP priorities (Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, Generation). 27 LLMs are evaluated.

Result: LLMs struggle with reading comprehension and translation. GPT-4o scores 72.23%, while SEA-LION v3 70B scores 61.07%.

Conclusion: Language-specific benchmarks like FilBench are crucial for advancing Filipino NLP and inclusion in LLM development.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLMs on English-based tasks, little is
known about their capabilities in specific languages such as Filipino. In this
work, we address this gap by introducing FilBench, a Filipino-centric benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities in
Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano. We carefully curate the tasks in FilBench to
reflect the priorities and trends of NLP research in the Philippines such as
Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. By
evaluating 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on FilBench, we find that several LLMs
suffer from reading comprehension and translation capabilities. Our results
indicate that FilBench is challenging, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving
only a score of 72.23%. Moreover, we also find that models trained specifically
for Southeast Asian languages tend to underperform on FilBench, with the
highest-performing model, SEA-LION v3 70B, achieving only a score of 61.07%.
Our work demonstrates the value of curating language-specific LLM benchmarks to
aid in driving progress on Filipino NLP and increasing the inclusion of
Philippine languages in LLM development.

Motivation: The lack of structured, machine-readable terminological data for South Africa's languages hinders multilingual NLP progress.

Method: Marito systematically collects, cleans, and standardizes scattered terminology lists into interoperable datasets under the NOODL framework.

Result: Integration into a RAG pipeline shows significant accuracy and consistency improvements in English-to-Tshivenda machine translation.

Conclusion: Marito provides a scalable, equitable foundation for NLP technologies, supporting South Africa's linguistic diversity.

Abstract: The critical lack of structured terminological data for South Africa's
official languages hampers progress in multilingual NLP, despite the existence
of numerous government and academic terminology lists. These valuable assets
remain fragmented and locked in non-machine-readable formats, rendering them
unusable for computational research and development. \emph{Marito} addresses
this challenge by systematically aggregating, cleaning, and standardising these
scattered resources into open, interoperable datasets. We introduce the
foundational \emph{Marito} dataset, released under the equitable,
Africa-centered NOODL framework. To demonstrate its immediate utility, we
integrate the terminology into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
Experiments show substantial improvements in the accuracy and domain-specific
consistency of English-to-Tshivenda machine translation for large language
models. \emph{Marito} provides a scalable foundation for developing robust and
equitable NLP technologies, ensuring South Africa's rich linguistic diversity

*Xiaoming Hou,Jiquan Zhang,Zibin Lin,DaCheng Tao,Shengli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmbedGrad optimizes text prompt embeddings via gradient-based refinement, improving task adaptation without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of discrete prompt engineering and continuous parameter adaptation by refining prompt embeddings.

Method: Decouples training and deployment, using labeled examples for gradient-based embedding adjustments while preserving semantics.

Result: Significant accuracy improvements, e.g., from 14.74% to 58.96% on mathematical reasoning tasks, across model scales and tasks.

Conclusion: Embedding refinement is a powerful new paradigm for adapting pretrained models to diverse tasks.

Abstract: Effectively adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks
remains a key challenge in AI deployment. Current approaches primarily follow
two paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering,
or continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit
limitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based
techniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these
constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt
embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples
training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise
embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only
optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained
calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning
capability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive
evaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal
judgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning
prompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\% to 58.96\% on
mathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model
scales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for
smaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt
engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work
establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task
adaptation.

TL;DR: LAGER is a lightweight framework improving LLM-as-a-judge alignment with human preferences by leveraging internal representations across layers, outperforming baselines by up to 7.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving alignment of automated LLM evaluation with human preferences without complex prompts or fine-tuning.

Method: Aggregates cross-layer score-token logits and computes expected scores from a softmax-based distribution, keeping the LLM backbone frozen.

Result: Achieves up to 7.5% improvement over baselines on benchmarks like Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen.

Conclusion: LAGER effectively enhances alignment with human judgments and performs comparably to reasoning-based methods without additional steps.

Abstract: The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of
automated evaluation using large language models, a paradigm known as
"LLMas-a-judge." However, improving its alignment with human preferences
without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work,
motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode
semantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with
human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and
efficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring,
via internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by
aggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from
a softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully
leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the
limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the
standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman
correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the
best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches
or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications,
such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the
effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: Address performance degradation in LLMs due to catastrophic forgetting during domain shifts.

Method: Proposes KILO, combining dynamic knowledge graphs and instruction tuning, pretrained on WikiText-103 and evaluated across BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND domains.

Result: KILO outperforms baselines (continual fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, CPT) in backward/forward transfer, F1 score, retention, and efficiency.

Conclusion: Combining structured knowledge retrieval and instruction prompting effectively tackles domain shift challenges in continual learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when
faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting. In this
work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation),
a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs
with instruction tuning. By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as
guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and
retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on
WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target
domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that
KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual
fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward
transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and
instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning
scenarios.

Motivation: Current benchmarks for RAG systems are inadequate, focusing on specific parts and using synthetic data, failing to reflect real-world challenges.

Method: Introduces Double-Bench, a large-scale, multilingual, multimodal evaluation system with 3,276 documents and 5,168 queries across 6 languages and 4 document types, verified by human experts.

Result: Experiments show narrowing gaps between text and visual embedding models and reveal over-confidence in current RAG frameworks.

Conclusion: Double-Bench provides a rigorous foundation for future RAG research, with plans for annual updates.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their
development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks
often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with
incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect
real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal
evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each
component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880
pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4
document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data
contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence
pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.
Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4
MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text
and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building
stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the
over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to
provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source
Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced
document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new
benchmarks on an annual basis.

*Xinyu Wang,Yue Zhang,Liqiang Jing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA), addressing limitations like poor visual understanding and lack of conceptual knowledge with a training-free framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm's complexity in sentiment analysis and the underexplored potential of LVLMs in MSA motivated this study.

Method: A training-free framework integrating object extraction and external conceptual knowledge is proposed to enhance LVLMs' sarcasm interpretation.

Result: Experiments show the framework's effectiveness in improving multimodal sarcasm detection and explanation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses LVLMs' limitations in MSA, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon that involves a disparity between
literal and intended meanings, making it challenging for sentiment analysis and
other emotion-sensitive tasks. While traditional sarcasm detection methods
primarily focus on text, recent approaches have incorporated multimodal
information. However, the application of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs)
in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we
evaluate LVLMs in MSA tasks, specifically focusing on Multimodal Sarcasm
Detection and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify key limitations, such as insufficient visual
understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge. To address these issues, we
propose a training-free framework that integrates in-depth object extraction
and external conceptual knowledge to improve the model's ability to interpret
and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The experimental results on
multiple models show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The code is

*Zixuan Li,Binzong Geng,Jing Xiong,Yong He,Yuxuan Hu,Jian Chen,Dingwei Chen,Xiyu Chang,Liang Zhang,Linjian Mo,Chengming Li,Chuan Yuan,Zhenan Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CTR-Sink improves CTR prediction by addressing semantic fragmentation in LMs with behavior-level attention sinks and a two-stage training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User behavior sequences in recommendation systems differ from natural language, causing LMs to scatter attention and degrade prediction performance.

Method: Introduces behavior-level attention sinks (sink tokens) and a two-stage training strategy to regulate attention and capture behavioral correlations.

Result: Validated on industrial and open-source datasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), showing effectiveness in improving prediction performance.

Conclusion: CTR-Sink successfully bridges the structural gap in LMs for CTR prediction, enhancing attention focus and performance.

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems,
estimates user click likelihood using historical behavioral data. Modeling user
behavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has
gained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual
modeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior
sequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty
separators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM
pre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention
scatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior
boundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.
To address this, we propose $\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing
behavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired
by attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically
regulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we
insert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating
recommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable
attention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy
that explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink
mechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral
correlations. Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source
datasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), alongside visualization results, validate the
method's effectiveness across scenarios.

TL;DR: FairLangProc is a Python package for implementing fairness techniques in NLP, compatible with Hugging Face, to address bias in decision-making contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about fairness in LLMs for critical applications like healthcare and justice drive the need for centralized bias mitigation tools.

Method: Develops FairLangProc, a Python package integrating recent fairness advances in NLP with Hugging Face compatibility.

Result: Provides a unified implementation of fairness metrics and algorithms, accessible via GitHub.

Conclusion: FairLangProc aims to democratize bias mitigation in NLP by offering a standardized, user-friendly tool.

Abstract: The rise in usage of Large Language Models to near ubiquitousness in recent
years has risen societal concern about their applications in decision-making
contexts, such as organizational justice or healthcare. This, in turn, poses
questions about the fairness of these models in critical settings, which leads
to the developement of different procedures to address bias in Natural Language
Processing. Although many datasets, metrics and algorithms have been proposed
to measure and mitigate harmful prejudice in Natural Language Processing, their
implementation is diverse and far from centralized. As a response, this paper
presents FairLangProc, a comprehensive Python package providing a common
implementation of some of the more recent advances in fairness in Natural
Language Processing providing an interface compatible with the famous Hugging
Face transformers library, aiming to encourage the widespread use and
democratization of bias mitigation techniques. The implementation can be found

*Yangtian Zi,Harshitha Menon,Arjun Guha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLMs underperform on specialized benchmarks due to lack of domain knowledge or insufficient prompt detail, using PartialOrderEval to measure prompt specificity impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs' underperformance on specialized benchmarks like ParEval stems from missing domain knowledge or inadequate prompt detail.

Method: Introduces PartialOrderEval, augmenting benchmarks with a partial order of prompts (minimal to maximally detailed), and tests it on HumanEval and ParEval subsets with models like Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder.

Result: Shows varying prompt sensitivity across tasks, with explicit I/O specs, edge-case handling, and stepwise breakdowns as key factors improving performance.

Conclusion: Prompt detail significantly impacts LLM performance on specialized tasks, highlighting the importance of specificity in benchmarks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high pass@1 on general
benchmarks like HumanEval but underperform on specialized suites such as
ParEval. Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt
detail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments
any code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to
maximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets
of ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our
experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of
prompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis
highlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise
breakdowns as the key drivers of prompt detail improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CompassVerifier is a lightweight verifier model for evaluating LLM outputs, addressing gaps in benchmarks and robustness. It handles diverse tasks and answer types, supported by the VerifierBench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current answer verification methods lack comprehensive benchmarks and robustness, requiring extensive customization. This work aims to improve verification accuracy and generalizability.

Method: Developed CompassVerifier, a verifier model for multi-domain tasks, and introduced VerifierBench, a benchmark with augmented data from manual metaerror analysis.

Result: CompassVerifier demonstrates competency in math, knowledge, and reasoning tasks, handling various answer types and identifying invalid responses.

Conclusion: CompassVerifier and VerifierBench advance answer verification, evaluation, and reinforcement learning research, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but
also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation
frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer
verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules
or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current
methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically
evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent
stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the
robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across
different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and
robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It
demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse
reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including
multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively
identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark
comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented
through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We
anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer
verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code

self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2)
Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences

structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature
representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model
obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW

significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose
estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation
technology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamVVT is a two-stage framework using Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to enhance video virtual try-on (VVT) by leveraging unpaired data and pretrained models for better detail preservation and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VVT methods rely on scarce paired datasets and fail to use advanced visual priors, leading to poor detail retention and temporal coherence in unconstrained scenarios.

Method: 1) Keyframe synthesis using a multi-frame try-on model with a vision-language model (VLM). 2) Video generation using skeleton maps, motion/appearance descriptions, and LoRA-enhanced pretrained models.

Result: DreamVVT outperforms existing methods in preserving garment details and ensuring temporal stability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: DreamVVT effectively addresses the limitations of current VVT methods by combining unpaired data, pretrained models, and a two-stage framework for superior performance.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

### [53] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Replacing layer normalization (LN) with DynTanh in IJEPA preserves token energy hierarchy, improving model performance and fixing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LN disrupts the natural energy hierarchy of visual tokens, equalizing their energies and preventing prioritization of semantically rich regions.

Method: Replace LN with DynTanh activation to preserve token energies and allow high-energy tokens to contribute more to the prediction loss.

Result: Improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy (38% to 42.7% for ViT-Small) and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2.

Conclusion: Preserving natural token energies is crucial for effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE combines NeRF's photorealistic rendering with Gaussian Splatting's editable structure, enabling real-time scene manipulation and dynamic interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between high-fidelity neural rendering (NeRF) and editable, explicit scene representations (Gaussian Splatting).

Method: Hybrid model using trainable feature embeddings for Gaussians, RT-GPS for efficient nearest Gaussian search, and a multi-resolution hash grid for feature updates.

Result: Real-time, locality-aware editing with intuitive scene manipulation and compatibility with physics-based simulation.

Conclusion: GENIE successfully merges implicit and explicit representations, offering photorealistic rendering with interactive editing capabilities.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel coarse-to-fine segmentation framework uses noisy coarse annotations to approximate precise labels, outperforming weakly supervised methods and nearing fully supervised performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality pixel-level medical annotations are costly and require expertise; the method aims to reduce reliance on such annotations.

Method: Introduces transition matrices to model noise in coarse annotations, jointly trains on multiple sets, and refines outputs progressively.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods and approaches fully supervised performance on cardiac imaging datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages coarse annotations to achieve robust segmentation, reducing the need for precise labels.

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

TL;DR: MIDAR is a LiDAR detection mimicking model for traffic simulators, bridging the gap between high-fidelity but unscalable simulators and scalable but perception-lacking ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability and perception modeling limitations in current simulators for cooperative perception in autonomous driving.

Method: MIDAR uses vehicle-level features to approximate LiDAR detections, employing a GRU-enhanced APPNP architecture on a refined multi-hop line-of-sight graph.

Result: Achieves an AUC of 0.909 in mimicking CenterPoint's LiDAR detection on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: MIDAR enables realistic detection modeling in scalable traffic simulators, validated by CP-based applications, and will be open-sourced.

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer-based neural networks perform on satellite imagery, given their success in other domains.

Method: Comparison of 11 detection algorithms (5 transformer-based, 6 convolutional) on 3 remote sensing datasets, training and evaluating 33 models.

Result: Transformers demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in object detection for satellite imagery.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architectures are highly effective for remote sensing tasks, outperforming traditional convolutional networks.

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisuCraft enhances LVLMs for creative content generation by integrating a multimodal extractor and dynamic prompt module, outperforming baselines in creativity and instruction adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with visual fidelity, creativity, and precise instruction adherence in long-form text generation.

Method: VisuCraft uses a multimodal structured information extractor and dynamic prompt generation module to optimize LVLM prompts.

Result: Outperforms baselines in tasks like story generation and poetry, especially in creativity and instruction adherence.

Conclusion: VisuCraft unlocks new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces robust denoising diffusion models for unsupervised anomaly segmentation using contaminated data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models require normal data for training, limiting real-world applicability. The paper addresses this by proposing models for contaminated data.

Method: The authors reinterpret denoising diffusion as nonlinear regression, using robust regression to derive robust diffusion models.

Result: The method achieves up to 8.08% higher AUROC and 10.37% higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed robust diffusion models are effective for anomaly segmentation with contaminated data, offering flexibility and superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for generating acoustic profiles in indoor scenes based on user-defined material configurations, using an encoder-decoder model to predict Room Impulse Responses (RIRs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable dynamic control of acoustic profiles in indoor scenes by simulating how materials like carpets and acoustic tiles affect sound.

Method: A novel encoder-decoder approach encodes scene properties from audio-visual observations and generates RIRs conditioned on user-specified materials.

Result: The model outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art methods, generating high-fidelity RIRs for diverse material configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses material-controlled acoustic profile generation, validated by the new Acoustic Wonderland Dataset.

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Off-the-shelf LVLMs can perform VLN tasks but lag behind specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of off-the-shelf LVLMs in VLN tasks and their adaptability to different action paradigms.

Method: Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the R2R dataset, evaluating performance in low-level and panoramic action spaces.

Result: Achieved a 41% success rate on R2R, showing LVLMs can learn VLN but underperform specialized models.

Conclusion: Off-the-shelf LVLMs are viable for VLN but require further optimization to match task-specific models.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

### [62] [How Diffusion Prior Landscapes Shape the Posterior in Blind Deconvolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02923)
*Minh-Hai Nguyen,Edouard Pauwels,Pierre Weiss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAP estimation in blind deconvolution often favors blurry solutions with sparsity-promoting priors. Diffusion-based priors reveal blurry images have higher likelihoods, but local minimizers correspond to natural images. Gradient descent can find these solutions, suggesting good initialization is key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of MAP estimation in blind deconvolution, which tends to produce blurry solutions despite using sparsity-promoting priors.

Method: The study uses diffusion-based priors to analyze the likelihood landscape, identifying properties like higher likelihood for blurry images and local minimizers for natural images. Theoretical analysis and gradient descent are employed.

Result: MAP favors sharp filters and blurry images, but local minimizers correspond to realistic solutions. Good initialization is crucial for overcoming MAP's limitations.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based priors and gradient descent can effectively solve blind deconvolution by targeting local minimizers, improving prior design and optimization techniques.

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

### [63] [Infrared Object Detection with Ultra Small ConvNets: Is ImageNet Pretraining Still Useful?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02927)
*Srikanth Muralidharan,Heitor R. Medeiros,Masih Aminbeidokhti,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of ImageNet pre-training on ultra-small models (<1M parameters) for robustness in infrared object detection tasks, finding diminishing returns beyond a certain model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if pre-training benefits small models for embedded devices, especially in robustness for out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: Constructed ultra-small backbone families using scaling laws and evaluated their performance on three datasets with ImageNet pre-training.

Result: Pre-training helps but offers diminishing robustness gains beyond a certain model size; too-small models perform poorly in varied conditions.

Conclusion: Practitioners should use pre-training but avoid overly small models for robust performance in diverse conditions.

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

*Chenxu Zhang,Zenan Li,Hongyi Xu,You Xie,Xiaochen Zhao,Tianpei Gu,Guoxian Song,Xin Chen,Chao Liang,Jianwen Jiang,Linjie Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Actor is an audio-driven framework for lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single image and audio clip, outperforming prior methods in long-form, nuanced performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior methods focused on lip sync and short-range fidelity, enabling actor-quality, emotionally rich, long-form portrait animations.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: an autoregressive diffusion model predicts facial motion latent tokens from audio, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis module.

Result: Produces cinematic-style, emotionally rich performances, achieving state-of-the-art in long-range audio-driven portrait acting.

Conclusion: X-Actor advances audio-driven animation by enabling coherent, long-form, emotionally expressive performances.

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond
standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in
long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

### [65] [Towards Robust Image Denoising with Scale Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02967)
*Dawei Zhang,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scale-equivariant framework for robust blind denoising, addressing generalization gaps in handling out-of-distribution noise patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image denoising models struggle with generalization, especially under spatially variant noise (OOD conditions). The work explores scale equivariance as a solution.

Method: Introduces a framework with a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM) for feature stability and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM) for information modulation.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, particularly for spatially heterogeneous noise.

Conclusion: Scale equivariance improves OOD robustness in denoising, with HNM and IGM enhancing performance under varying noise conditions.

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

*Alakh Desai,Nuno Vasconcelos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANSWER is a training-free technique for diffusion models that improves prompt adherence by leveraging internal negation understanding, outperforming baselines and human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models vary in prompt adherence and quality. Negative prompting was introduced to improve compliance, but existing methods are lossy and incomplete.

Method: Developed ANSWER, a sampling procedure that uses classifier-free guidance to account for positive and negative conditions from a single prompt without external resources.

Result: ANSWER outperforms baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more than other methods.

Conclusion: ANSWER enhances diffusion models' ability to generate prompt-faithful images without explicit negative prompts, offering a practical and effective solution.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to separate shared and domain-specific LoRAs into distinct subspaces for better multi-domain learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA-based multi-domain learning architectures may not effectively capture domain-specific information.

Method: Ensures shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces (column and left null subspaces of pre-trained weights).

Result: Applied to action recognition with UCF101, Kinetics400, and HMDB51 datasets, showing effectiveness in some cases.

Conclusion: The method improves domain-specific information capture, with insights from LoRA weight dimension analysis.

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,
Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along
with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static bias in action recognition models reduces generalization performance, prompting the need for a solution.

Method: Proposes MoExDA, a lightweight domain adaptation method using edge frames alongside RGB frames to mitigate static bias.

Result: Effectively suppresses static bias with lower computational cost, enhancing action recognition robustness.

Conclusion: MoExDA offers a lightweight, effective solution to static bias, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Modern action recognition models suffer from static bias, leading to reduced
generalization performance. In this paper, we propose MoExDA, a lightweight
domain adaptation between RGB and edge information using edge frames in
addition to RGB frames to counter the static bias issue. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses static bias with a
lower computational cost, allowing for more robust action recognition than
previous approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFOG is a neural-architecture agnostic adversarial attack method targeting object detection transformers and CNNs, outperforming existing methods by up to 83%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial perturbation methods are limited to CNN-based detectors or ineffective against transformer-based ones, highlighting the need for a unified approach.

Method: AFOG uses a learnable attention mechanism to focus perturbations on vulnerable regions, integrating feature loss and iterative adversarial updates.

Result: AFOG improves attack performance by up to 30.6% over baselines and outperforms existing methods by up to 83% in speed and imperceptibility.

Conclusion: AFOG is an efficient, stealthy, and effective adversarial attack method for both transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

### [70] [Seeing It Before It Happens: In-Generation NSFW Detection for Diffusion-Based Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03006)
*Fan Yang,Yihao Huang,Jiayi Zhu,Ling Shi,Geguang Pu,Jin Song Dong,Kailong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces In-Generation Detection (IGD), a method to detect NSFW content during the diffusion process in text-to-image models, achieving 91.32% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on pre- or post-generation detection, leaving the in-generation phase unexplored for NSFW content.

Method: IGD uses predicted noise during diffusion as an internal signal to identify NSFW content, leveraging semantic cues.

Result: IGD achieves 91.32% detection accuracy across seven NSFW categories, outperforming seven baselines.

Conclusion: IGD is a simple yet effective approach for detecting NSFW content during image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

### [71] [Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration via VFM for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03007)
*Xinhui Li,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGFC is a framework for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) that aligns VFM features hierarchically (coarse-to-fine) to improve robustness across unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DGSS methods focus on global feature fine-tuning, neglecting hierarchical adaptation, which is critical for precise dense prediction.

Method: MGFC performs coarse-to-fine feature calibration: coarse-grained for global context, medium-grained for category-level discriminability, and fine-grained for spatial detail enhancement.

Result: MGFC outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Multi-granularity adaptation is effective for DGSS, leveraging VFMs' generalization strengths.

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SceneQA and the LVSQA dataset to improve MLLMs' long video understanding by focusing on scene-based detail perception. It proposes SLFG, a method combining frames into coherent scenes, enhancing performance without model changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long video understanding due to resource limits and irrelevant frame processing. Existing tasks don't align with real-world needs.

Method: Proposes SLFG, which combines frames into coherent scenes using scene localization and dynamic frame reassembly, requiring no model changes.

Result: SLFG significantly improves MLLMs' performance in long video benchmarks.

Conclusion: SceneQA and SLFG offer a practical solution for enhancing MLLMs' scene perception in long videos, with promising experimental results.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA-3DGS reduces storage costs for 3D Gaussian Splatting by learning importance scores for pruning and clustering, maintaining rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for compressing Gaussian models in 3D scenes fail to identify insignificant points, leading to poor pruning and compression quality.

Method: SA-3DGS uses importance scores for pruning, importance-aware clustering for compression, and codebook repair to mitigate quality loss.

Result: Achieves up to 66x compression with maintained or improved rendering quality, outperforming other methods like LightGaussian.

Conclusion: SA-3DGS offers efficient compression and improved rendering, with strong generalization to other pruning-based methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V models struggle with fine-grained facial dynamics and temporal identity coherence, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: MoCA integrates Mixture of Cross-Attention layers into a Diffusion Transformer, using Hierarchical Temporal Pooling and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention Experts for spatiotemporal modeling, along with a Latent Video Perceptual Loss.

Result: MoCA achieves over 5% better face similarity on the CelebIPVid dataset compared to existing T2V methods.

Conclusion: MoCA effectively addresses identity consistency in T2V generation, demonstrating superior performance through its innovative architecture and training on diverse data.

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face
similarity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in cross-video understanding, such as connecting video streams and managing multi-source information retrieval.

Method: Uses person-level features, hierarchical spanning trees, and multi-agent reasoning to analyze cross-video queries.

Result: Achieves 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior analysis, and 51.67% in summarization/reasoning.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for cross-video understanding by unifying video streams through person-level features.

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed
visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work focuses on single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, lacking applicability to multi-human interactions.

Method: An automatic pipeline collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos, forming the MIT dataset. The CovOG model uses a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) and Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) for realistic video generation.

Result: The MIT dataset includes 12 hours of high-resolution footage with fine-grained annotations. CovOG demonstrates feasibility but highlights challenges in multi-human talking video generation.

Conclusion: MIT serves as a valuable benchmark, and CovOG provides a foundation for future research in multi-human talking video generation.

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to
four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech
interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

*Hyebin Cho,Jaehyup Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceMat is a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework for occlusion-aware face matting, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in real-world video scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face filters degrade under occlusions (e.g., hands, hair). The paper introduces face matting to separate occlusions from facial regions.

Method: FaceMat uses a two-stage training pipeline: a teacher model predicts alpha mattes and uncertainty, guiding a student model via knowledge distillation.

Result: FaceMat outperforms existing methods, improving visual quality and robustness in unconstrained video scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for real-time applications, supported by the new CelebAMat dataset.

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

*Lekang Wen,Jing Xiao,Liang Liao,Jiajun Chen,Mi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHARM is a complementary learning framework for modality-agnostic semantic segmentation, focusing on harmonization rather than homogenization. It uses Mutual Perception Unit and dual-path optimization to preserve modality strengths while achieving alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods dilute modality strengths by homogenizing features. CHARM aims to preserve modality-specific advantages while enabling cross-modal complementarity.

Method: CHARM includes (1) Mutual Perception Unit for implicit alignment via cross-modal interaction and (2) a dual-path optimization strategy (Collaborative Learning and Individual Enhancement).

Result: CHARM outperforms baselines across datasets and backbones, especially improving fragile modalities.

Conclusion: CHARM shifts focus from homogenization to harmonization, achieving true cross-modal complementarity.

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

*Trinh Quoc Nguyen,Oky Dicky Ardiansyah Prima,Katsuyoshi Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CORE-ReID, a framework for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Person Re-identification, using CycleGAN for data generation, multi-level clustering for pseudo-labels, and an Ensemble Fusion component for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in Person ReID under UDA, such as domain gaps and ambiguity from pseudo-labels, by harmonizing data and enhancing feature fusion.

Method: Uses CycleGAN for diverse data generation, teacher-student networks with multi-level clustering, and an Ensemble Fusion component for local-global feature integration.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains in Mean Average Precision and Top-k accuracy on three common UDA benchmarks.

Conclusion: CORE-ReID is an advanced, effective solution for UDA in Person ReID, with clear fusion features and high accuracy.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

### [80] [SSFMamba: Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency Feature Fusion for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03069)
*Bo Zhang,Yifan Zhang,Shuo Yan,Yu Bai,Zheng Zhang,Wu Liu,Xiuzhuang Zhou,Wendong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSFMamba, a Mamba-based network, enhances 3D medical image segmentation by fusing spatial and frequency domain features, leveraging conjugate symmetry and global context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook unique frequency domain properties and fail to bridge spatial-frequency domain differences, limiting segmentation performance.

Method: SSFMamba uses a dual-branch architecture with Mamba blocks for feature fusion, a 3D multi-directional scanning mechanism, and exploits frequency domain properties.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: SSFMamba effectively combines spatial and frequency domain features, improving segmentation accuracy by preserving global context and local details.

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

*Anran Wu,Long Peng,Xin Di,Xueyuan Dai,Chen Wu,Yang Wang,Xueyang Fu,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustGS enhances feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by improving robustness under adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D reconstruction without per-scene optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feedforward 3DGS methods assume clean input images, but real-world conditions (noise, low light, rain) degrade reconstruction quality. RobustGS addresses this gap.

Method: Introduces a Generalized Degradation Learner for multi-view degradation awareness and a semantic-aware state-space model to enhance corrupted inputs and aggregate cross-view information.

Result: RobustGS consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across various degradations when integrated into existing methods.

Conclusion: RobustGS is a plug-and-play solution that significantly improves the robustness and quality of feedforward 3DGS under challenging imaging conditions.

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

TL;DR: The study explores fairness in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) beyond traditional demographic attributes, revealing biases influenced by cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unexplored fairness issues in LVLMs beyond race and gender, focusing on a broader range of attributes.

Method: Construct an open-set knowledge base of bias attributes using LLMs and evaluate LVLM fairness across finer-grained attributes.

Result: LVLMs show biased outputs across diverse attributes, with cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors having a stronger impact than demographic ones.

Conclusion: Fairness in LVLMs requires broader attribute consideration, as non-demographic factors significantly influence bias.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

### [83] [Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation for Multiple Instance Learning-based Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03081)
*Bo Zhang,Xu Xinan,Shuo Yan,Yu Bai,Zheng Zhang,Wufan Wang,Wendong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes $C^2Aug$, a method to enhance pseudo-bag diversity in MIL-based WSI classification by sampling instances from all bags of the same class, and introduces contrastive learning to improve feature discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pseudo-bag augmentation methods lack diversity due to limited sampling, and increased critical instances in pseudo-bags can degrade performance on slides with small tumor areas.

Method: Proposes $C^2Aug$ for cross-bag instance sampling and a contrastive learning framework at bag and group levels to enhance feature discrimination.

Result: $C^2Aug$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses diversity and performance issues in MIL-based WSI classification.

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

*Jiantao Tan,Peixian Ma,Kanghao Chen,Zhiming Dai,Ruixuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for continual learning in medical image classification uses LLM-generated visual concepts and cross-modal attention to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for continual learning in medical image classification lack rich semantic information from multimodal data, relying only on simplistic templates.

Method: Proposes a framework using LLM-generated visual concepts, a similarity-based filtering mechanism, and a cross-modal image-concept attention module with attention loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on medical and natural image datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively integrates richer semantic information, demonstrating superiority in continual learning tasks.

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

*Yogesh Kulkarni,Pooyan Fazli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVATAR improves multimodal video reasoning by addressing data inefficiency, vanishing advantages, and uniform credit assignment with off-policy training and Temporal Advantage Shaping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like GRPO face limitations in data efficiency, vanishing advantages, and uniform credit assignment, hindering effective multimodal reasoning.

Method: AVATAR uses off-policy training for better sample efficiency and Temporal Advantage Shaping (TAS) to emphasize critical reasoning steps.

Result: AVATAR outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni by +5.4 on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and +4.5 on Video-Holmes, with 35% higher sample efficiency.

Conclusion: AVATAR effectively addresses key limitations in multimodal reasoning, achieving superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

### [86] [Causal Disentanglement and Cross-Modal Alignment for Enhanced Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03102)
*Tianjiao Jiang,Zhen Zhang,Yuhang Liu,Javen Qinfeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a framework for few-shot learning that disentangles CLIP's visual features using ICA, enhancing cross-modal alignment and improving classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods rely on entangled representations, making adaptation inefficient. CCA aims to explicitly disentangle features and leverage CLIP's alignment for better performance.

Method: CCA uses unsupervised ICA to disentangle CLIP's visual features, fine-tunes a text classifier, and employs cross-attention for bidirectional alignment.

Result: CCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets, showing robustness to distribution shifts and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: CCA effectively disentangles features and enhances alignment, improving few-shot learning performance and robustness.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

*Heng Jia,Linchao Zhu,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H3R is a hybrid framework combining volumetric latent fusion and attention-based feature aggregation for generalizable 3D reconstruction, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between geometric precision (explicit methods) and robustness (implicit methods) in multi-view correspondence modeling.

Method: Integrates a geometric-consistent latent volume with a camera-aware Transformer using Plücker coordinates for adaptive refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 2× faster convergence and PSNR improvements (0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, 0.22 dB on benchmarks).

Conclusion: H3R resolves semantic-spatial mismatches and supports high-resolution inputs, demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and
DTU datasets, respectively. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Landsat30-AU, a vision-language dataset for satellite imagery, addressing gaps in existing datasets by focusing on long-term, low-resolution, multi-satellite archives. It includes image-caption pairs and VQA samples, with evaluations showing current VLMs struggle but improve with fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize Earth observation by making satellite imagery accessible and useful for non-specialists and experts, while addressing the lack of datasets for long-term, low-resolution, multi-satellite archives.

Method: Developed Landsat30-AU, a dataset with image-caption pairs (Landsat30-AU-Cap) and VQA samples (Landsat30-AU-VQA), curated using a bootstrapped pipeline with iterative refinement and human verification.

Result: Off-the-shelf VLMs performed poorly, but fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on Landsat30-AU improved captioning (0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr) and VQA accuracy (0.74 to 0.87).

Conclusion: Landsat30-AU fills a critical gap in satellite imagery datasets, enabling better VLMs for Earth observation, though current models require significant improvement.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

*Arion Zimmermann,Soon-Jo Chung,Fred Hadaegh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COFFEE is a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids, addressing biases from shadows and outperforming classical and deep learning methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate state estimation of unknown space bodies is crucial but challenged by shadow-induced biases and computational constraints of existing methods.

Method: COFFEE uses sun phase angle data to detect shadow-invariant features, combining a Sparse Neural Network and attention-based Graph Neural Network for feature matching.

Result: COFFEE is bias-free, more accurate than classical methods, and significantly faster than deep learning alternatives on synthetic and real asteroid data.

Conclusion: COFFEE provides a robust, efficient solution for real-time pose estimation of asteroids, mitigating shadow-related biases and computational limitations.

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the shortage of annotated fire-related data for building units to enhance fire early warning and rescue operations.

Method: Combines real multi-story scenes, motion blur, brightness adjustment, and large models to generate fire effects, simulating drone conditions.

Result: A dataset of 1,978 images covering diverse building scenarios, improving generalization in fire detection.

Conclusion: The dataset reduces risks and costs of real data collection while providing scalable, multi-scenario data for fire detection.

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniEdit-I, a training-free framework for enabling unified vision-language models (VLMs) with image editing capabilities through iterative understanding, editing, and verifying steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored challenge of enabling image editing in unified VLMs while maintaining their strong understanding capabilities.

Method: A three-step iterative process: understanding (semantic analysis and prompt modification), editing (time-adaptive offset for coherent denoising), and verifying (alignment checks and feedback).

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark using BLIP3-o.

Conclusion: UniEdit-I successfully enables high-fidelity image editing in unified VLMs without additional training, demonstrating its potential for future VLM development.

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

### [92] [SARD: Segmentation-Aware Anomaly Synthesis via Region-Constrained Diffusion with Discriminative Mask Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03143)
*Yanshu Wang,Xichen Xu,Xiaoning Lei,Guoyang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARD introduces a diffusion-based framework for precise anomaly synthesis, improving spatial control and fidelity by freezing backgrounds and updating only anomaly regions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing robustness in industrial anomaly detection requires realistic and spatially precise anomaly synthesis, which current diffusion-based methods lack due to poor spatial controllability and regional fidelity.

Method: SARD uses a Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process to freeze backgrounds and update only anomaly regions, along with a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module for joint global and local fidelity evaluation.

Result: SARD achieves superior segmentation accuracy and visual quality on MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: SARD effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering improved anomaly synthesis for industrial applications.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

*Liangyang Ouyang,Jiafeng Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LORE is a training-free, efficient image editing method that optimizes inverted noise to address semantic bias in text-driven image editing, outperforming baselines in semantic alignment, quality, and background fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inversion-based editing methods suffer from semantic bias toward the source concept, leading to editing failures or unintended modifications, especially for dissimilar source-target pairs.

Method: LORE directly optimizes the inverted noise without architectural changes or fine-tuning, improving generalization and controllability.

Result: LORE outperforms baselines on PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit benchmarks in semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity.

Conclusion: Latent-space optimization via LORE enables stable, controllable, and general-purpose concept replacement in text-driven image editing.

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

*Junyoung Lim,Jaewoo Ahn,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChartCap is a large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images with dense captions, designed to improve vision language models by excluding extraneous info and highlighting key insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chart datasets lack quality and structural detail, leading to inaccurate or hallucinated captions.

Method: A four-stage pipeline generates captions using only discernible chart data, with cycle consistency-based human verification for quality control. A novel Visual Consistency Score evaluates caption quality.

Result: Models fine-tuned on ChartCap produce more accurate, informative captions with fewer hallucinations, outperforming other models and human annotations.

Conclusion: ChartCap addresses dataset limitations and improves chart captioning quality, validated by experiments and a new metric.

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

*Zhaoxu Li,Chenqi Kong,Yi Yu,Qiangqiang Wu,Xinghao Jiang,Ngai-Man Cheung,Bihan Wen,Alex Kot,Xudong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucination issues in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) caused by stylized images, proposing a novel mechanism (SAVER) to mitigate these hallucinations effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in LVLMs limits real-world applicability, especially with stylized images in critical scenarios like game scenes, art education, and medical analysis.

Method: Constructs a dataset of photographic and stylized images with annotated captions, benchmarks 13 LVLMs, and introduces SAVER, a style-aware mechanism adjusting outputs based on visual attention patterns.

Result: Stylized images induce more hallucinations than photographic ones. SAVER outperforms existing methods in hallucination mitigation across models and tasks.

Conclusion: SAVER effectively reduces hallucinations in LVLMs for stylized images, enhancing their reliability in diverse applications.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

TL;DR: Duplex-GS introduces a dual-hierarchy framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting, combining proxy Gaussians with order-independent rendering to improve efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods rely on costly sequential alpha-blending, limiting performance on resource-constrained platforms.

Method: Uses proxy Gaussian representations, cell proxies for local management, and cell search rasterization. Integrates with OIT for weighted sum rendering.

Result: Achieves high-quality rendering with 1.5-4x speedup over OIT-based methods and reduces radix sort overhead by 52.2%-86.9%.

Conclusion: Duplex-GS enhances efficiency and quality in 3DGS, validated across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

TL;DR: A novel monocular depth estimation method using local and global cues with GLKAM and GBPM modules achieves competitive results on NYU-V2 and KITTI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the ambiguity in monocular depth estimation due to its ill-posed nature.

Method: Combines Gated Large Kernel Attention Module (GLKAM) for local cues and Global Bin Prediction Module (GBPM) for global depth distribution.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on NYU-V2 and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves depth estimation accuracy by integrating local and global structural information.

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

### [99] [Unifying Locality of KANs and Feature Drift Compensation for Data-free Continual Face Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03189)
*Tianshuo Zhang,Siran Peng,Li Gao,Haoyuan Zhang,Xiangyu Zhu,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a KAN-based framework (KAN-CFD) for continual face forgery detection, addressing catastrophic forgetting with a Domain-Group KAN Detector and a data-free replay strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face forgery detectors degrade on old forgery types when learning new ones (catastrophic forgetting). KANs' local plasticity suits continual learning but struggles with high-dimensional images and overlapping domains.

Method: Introduces KAN-CFD with DG-KD (Domain-Group KAN Detector) for high-dimensional image inputs and FS-KDCP (Feature Separation via KAN Drift Compensation Projection) to prevent input space overlap without prior task data.

Result: The method achieves superior performance and significantly reduces forgetting in experiments.

Conclusion: KAN-CFD effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in continual face forgery detection, leveraging KANs' strengths while overcoming their limitations.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTG-Net, a novel network for CNV segmentation in OCTA images, addressing challenges like irregular shapes and artifacts. It includes a new dataset (CNVSeg) and achieves high accuracy (Dice scores: 87.21% for regions, 88.12% for vessels).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNV in wet AMD causes blindness, and OCTA is used for CNV study. Accurate segmentation is crucial but hindered by irregular shapes, artifacts, and lack of public datasets.

Method: Proposes MTG-Net with multi-task framework and graph-based modules (MIGR, MRGR) for semantic and geometric constraints. Uses uncertainty-weighted loss to handle noise.

Result: MTG-Net outperforms existing methods with Dice scores of 87.21% (region) and 88.12% (vessel).

Conclusion: MTG-Net effectively segments CNV regions and vessels, addressing key challenges and improving clinical assessment of wet AMD.

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

TL;DR: AlignCAT improves weakly supervised visual grounding by addressing category and attribute ambiguity through coarse and fine-grained alignment modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack strong cross-modal reasoning for subtle semantic differences in text expressions.

Method: AlignCAT uses a query-based semantic matching framework with coarse-grained (category and global context) and fine-grained (descriptive and word-level features) alignment modules.

Result: AlignCAT outperforms existing methods on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg benchmarks.

Conclusion: AlignCAT effectively mitigates ambiguity and enhances visual-linguistic alignment for weakly supervised VG.

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INP-CC improves open-vocabulary HOI detection by integrating interaction-aware prompts and concept calibration, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with fine-grained region-level interaction detection and encoding textual descriptions for HOI.

Method: Proposes INP-CC with interaction-aware prompts and concept calibration, including a prompt generator and negative sampling.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets.

Conclusion: INP-CC enhances HOI detection by focusing on key interaction patterns and refining concept representations.

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoShield is a novel adversarial framework designed to protect geoprivacy by disrupting VLMs' ability to infer locations from images, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like GPT-4o can infer locations from public images, posing geoprivacy risks; current adversarial defenses are inadequate for high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets.

Method: GeoShield uses feature disentanglement, exposure element identification, and scale-adaptive enhancement to optimize perturbations globally and locally.

Result: GeoShield outperforms prior methods in black-box settings, providing strong privacy protection with minimal impact on image quality.

Conclusion: GeoShield is the first practical solution for defending against geolocation inference by VLMs, addressing escalating privacy concerns.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial Training (AT) is costly and harms standard performance, while existing data augmentation methods lack robustness or efficiency. A highly efficient and robust defense is needed.

Method: UAA pre-computes universal perturbations offline, decoupling expensive generation from training. It uses diverse augmentation synergies for robustness.

Result: UAA achieves SOTA robustness on benchmarks without online adversarial example generation, maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: UAA offers a practical, efficient solution for robust model training, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActionSink improves robot manipulation precision by reformulating actions as self-supervised "action flows" and integrating them iteratively for enhanced estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low precision in low-level action estimation limits robot manipulation performance, despite progress in high-level perception and planning.

Method: ActionSink uses a coarse-to-fine action flow matcher and dynamic integrator with a memory pool to refine and integrate action flows for precise estimation.

Result: ActionSink outperforms prior SOTA by 7.9% on LIBERO and achieves an 8% gain on LIBERO-Long.

Conclusion: ActionSink advances precise action estimation in robot manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

TL;DR: Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT) improves 3D segmentation in Gaussian Splatting by addressing 2D mask inconsistencies and refining Gaussians with adaptive density control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 2D-to-3D segmentation in Gaussian Splatting produce noisy boundaries due to inconsistent 2D masks and neglect of semantic cues.

Method: GIT introduces an instance weight matrix to correct 2D inconsistencies and uses adaptive density control to split/prune ambiguous Gaussians.

Result: The method achieves cleaner 3D assets and sharper segmentation boundaries, improving performance in online and offline settings.

Conclusion: GIT enables applications like hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing by enhancing 3D segmentation consistency.

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot classification pipeline using SAM and DINOv2 achieves high-precision nanoparticle shape classification without extensive labeled data or training, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional deep learning for nanoparticle morphology classification is resource-intensive, limiting accessibility for practitioners.

Method: Combines SAM for segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding with a lightweight classifier, avoiding fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms fine-tuned baselines, handles small datasets and domain shifts, and enables synthesis progress assessment via clustering metrics.

Conclusion: Foundation models offer efficient, accessible alternatives to traditional deep learning for automated microscopy image analysis.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product
quality in nanomaterial synthesis and accelerating development. However,
conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive
labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their
accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and
industrial settings. In this study, we introduce a zero-shot classification
pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By
combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle
research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

*Xingchao Yang,Shiori Ueda,Yuantian Huang,Tomoya Akiyama,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality synthetic dataset of paired bare-makeup facial images, addressing the lack of realistic and consistent datasets for beauty-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing paired makeup datasets are limited in quality and realism, and synthetic methods often distort facial features or identities. FFHQ-Makeup aims to fill this gap.

Method: The dataset is built by transferring real-world makeup styles onto 18K identities from the FFHQ dataset using an improved makeup transfer method that preserves identity and expression. Each identity is paired with 5 makeup styles, totaling 90K image pairs.

Result: FFHQ-Makeup provides a large-scale, high-quality dataset of paired bare-makeup images, preserving facial consistency and diversity in makeup styles.

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup is a valuable resource for beauty-related research, addressing the limitations of existing datasets and synthetic methods.

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

*Lukas Ranftl,Felix Brendel,Bertram Drost,Carsten Steger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVTOP is a transformer-based method for multi-view rigid object pose estimation, resolving ambiguities by fusing view-specific features early and modeling multi-view geometry via lines of sight. It outperforms single-view and existing multi-view methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose ambiguities in single-view or post-processed multi-view methods are challenging. MVTOP aims to solve these by leveraging early fusion and multi-view geometry.

Method: Uses transformer architecture with early fusion of view-specific features and models multi-view geometry via lines of sight. Assumes known camera parameters but allows variability per inference.

Result: Outperforms single-view and existing multi-view methods on a synthetic dataset and achieves competitive results on YCB-V.

Conclusion: MVTOP is a versatile, end-to-end trainable solution for multi-view pose estimation, uniquely resolving ambiguities without additional data like depth.

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices, with novel encoding and loss strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras have high temporal resolution and low latency but limited spatial resolution, challenging fine-grained perception tasks.

Method: Proposes a Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy and Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss (LearnSTPLoss) for efficient SNN-based super-resolution.

Result: Achieves competitive super-resolution performance while reducing model size and inference time.

Conclusion: The lightweight design is suitable for embedding in event cameras or as preprocessing for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

### [111] [Robust Single-Stage Fully Sparse 3D Object Detection via Detachable Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03252)
*Wentao Qu,Guofeng Mei,Jing Wang,Yujiao Wu,Xiaoshui Huang,Liang Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSDNet introduces a single-stage, fully sparse 3D object detection network using a detachable latent framework (DLF) of DDPMs, improving efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DDPM-based methods for 3D object detection are inefficient due to multi-step iterations in inference. RSDNet aims to address this by enabling single-step detection while maintaining robustness.

Method: RSDNet employs lightweight denoising networks (e.g., multi-level DAEs) in latent feature spaces and reformulates DDPM noising/denoising mechanisms. It includes semantic-geometric conditional guidance for better object boundary perception.

Result: RSDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, outperforming existing methods in robust 3D object detection.

Conclusion: RSDNet successfully combines efficiency and robustness in 3D object detection by leveraging a detachable latent framework and semantic-geometric guidance, enabling single-step inference.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ReDPO, a distillation method combining DPO and SFT to reduce computational costs in text-to-video models without performance loss, alongside the V.I.P. framework for dataset curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address mode collapse in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for pruned text-to-video models, which degrades quality.

Method: Integrates DPO and SFT for targeted property recovery, introduces V.I.P. for dataset filtering, and uses step-by-step online training.

Result: Achieves 36.2% and 67.5% parameter reduction in VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff while maintaining or surpassing full model performance.

Conclusion: ReDPO and V.I.P. enable efficient, high-quality video generation, validated on leading T2V models.

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

### [113] [Beyond Isolated Words: Diffusion Brush for Handwritten Text-Line Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03256)
*Gang Dai,Yifan Zhang,Yutao Qin,Qiangya Guo,Shuangping Huang,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffBrush is a diffusion-based model for generating handwritten text lines, excelling in style imitation and content accuracy through content-decoupled style learning and multi-scale content learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on isolated words, but realistic handwritten text requires modeling relationships between words (e.g., alignment, spacing). Generating entire text lines is more comprehensive but challenging.

Method: DiffBrush uses content-decoupled style learning (disentangling style from content via column- and row-wise masking) and multi-scale content learning (line and word discriminators for coherence and accuracy).

Result: Extensive experiments show DiffBrush generates high-quality text lines with strong style reproduction and content preservation.

Conclusion: DiffBrush addresses challenges in handwritten text-line generation, outperforming existing methods in style and content accuracy.

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

### [114] [VLMQ: Efficient Post-Training Quantization for Large Vision-Language Models via Hessian Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03351)
*Yufei Xue,Yushi Huang,Jiawei Shao,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMQ is a novel importance-aware PTQ framework for VLMs, addressing modality discrepancy and achieving SOTA performance under low-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Hessian-based PTQ methods for LLMs perform poorly on VLMs due to modality discrepancy (limited text tokens vs. redundant vision tokens).

Method: VLMQ optimizes an importance-aware objective for enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors and computes these via a lightweight block-wise backward pass.

Result: VLMQ achieves significant improvements, e.g., 16.45% on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization, across 8 benchmarks for VLMs.

Conclusion: VLMQ is an effective and efficient PTQ framework tailored for VLMs, outperforming existing methods, especially in low-bit settings.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Yuheng Ji,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoPrompt introduces a prompt learning-based framework for egocentric action recognition, unifying verb and noun components through a prompt pool and attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat verb and noun components independently, ignoring their semantic relationships, leading to fragmented representations and poor generalization.

Method: EgoPrompt uses a Unified Prompt Pool and attention-based fusion for cross-component interaction, with Diverse Pool Criteria for training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets in various benchmarks.

Conclusion: EgoPrompt effectively integrates verb and noun components, improving generalization and performance in egocentric action recognition.

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

TL;DR: EmmPD is a multimodal framework for placental disease diagnosis using WSIs, addressing patch selection and global context loss with a two-stage patch selection module and hybrid multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via WSIs is critical but challenged by computational demands and loss of global context in existing methods.

Method: Proposes EmmPD with a two-stage patch selection module (parameter-free and learnable compression) and a hybrid multimodal fusion module using adaptive graph learning and textual reports.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance on a self-constructed placental dataset and two public datasets.

Conclusion: EmmPD effectively balances computational efficiency and feature preservation, enhancing placental disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I diffusion models struggle with accurate personalization due to limited input token capacity.

Method: DrUM uses condition-level modeling in latent space with a transformer-based adapter and user profiling.

Result: DrUM shows strong performance on large-scale datasets and works with open-source text encoders.

Conclusion: DrUM enables seamless personalized generation without additional fine-tuning of foundation T2I models.

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDGPA introduces a method for zero-shot domain adaptive semantic segmentation using synthetic data generation and progressive adaptation to handle distribution shifts without target domain images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of deep learning models in handling distribution shifts between training and test data when no target images are available.

Method: Utilizes a text-to-image diffusion model to generate synthetic target-style images, crops and edits small patches for spatial precision, and employs progressive adaptation for stable learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: SDGPA effectively tackles domain adaptation challenges with synthetic data and progressive learning, demonstrating superior results.

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

TL;DR: BaroPoser combines IMU and barometric data from smartphones/smartwatches to improve human pose estimation on uneven terrain, outperforming IMU-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IMU-based methods struggle with pose estimation accuracy on uneven terrain due to sparse sensor data and lack of datasets.

Method: BaroPoser integrates IMU and barometric data, estimates height changes via barometric readings, and uses a local thigh coordinate frame for better motion representation.

Result: The method outperforms SOTA IMU-only approaches in accuracy for pose estimation and global translation on non-flat terrain.

Conclusion: BaroPoser demonstrates the effectiveness of combining IMU and barometric data for real-time human motion tracking on uneven surfaces.

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving object detection efficiency for resource-constrained devices by adapting KD, addressing challenges like dual objectives and feature imbalance.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy for KD methods in object detection, categorizing CNN and Transformer-based approaches, and evaluates them using mAP@0.5 on standard datasets.

Result: Comparative analysis of KD methods highlights their effectiveness and current challenges in object detection.

Conclusion: The taxonomy and analysis aim to guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based
detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation).
We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis
of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and
guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

Conclusion: Skywork UniPic proves high-fidelity multimodal integration is feasible without excessive resource demands, setting a practical paradigm for deployable AI.

Abstract: We introduce Skywork UniPic, a 1.5 billion-parameter autoregressive model
that unifies image understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing
within a single architecture-eliminating the need for task-specific adapters or
inter-module connectors-and demonstrate that compact multimodal systems can
achieve state-of-the-art performance on commodity hardware. Skywork UniPic
achieves a GenEval score of 0.86, surpassing most existing unified models; sets
a new DPG-Bench complex-generation record of 85.5; attains 5.83 on
GEditBench-EN and 3.49 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing; and generates 1024 x
1024 images with under 15 GB of GPU memory (e.g., RTX 4090). (1) a decoupled
encoding strategy that leverages a masked autoregressive encoder for synthesis
and a SigLIP2 encoder for understanding, all feeding a shared autoregressive
decoder; (2) a progressive, resolution-aware training schedule scaling from 256
x 256 to 1024 x 1024 while dynamically unfreezing parameters to balance
capacity and stability; and (3) meticulously curated, 100 million-scale
datasets augmented with task-specific reward models to refine generation and
editing objectives. By demonstrating that high-fidelity multimodal integration
need not incur prohibitive resource demands, Skywork UniPic establishes a
practical paradigm for deployable, high-fidelity multimodal AI. Code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand gesture recognition (HGR) using event-driven architecture and bio-inspired sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient, low-power HGR by mimicking biological sensing and reducing computational overhead.

Method: Uses a 24 GHz Doppler radar and custom neuromorphic sampler for spike-based encoding, processed by a lightweight neural network on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller.

Result: Achieves >85% real-time accuracy on a dataset of five gestures from seven users.

Conclusion: First bio-inspired, event-driven radar HGR system, demonstrating efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

### [123] [Beyond Meme Templates: Limitations of Visual Similarity Measures in Meme Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03562)
*Muzhaffar Hazman,Susan McKeever,Josephine Griffith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of current meme-matching methods, which focus only on template-based memes, and proposes broader approaches, including segment-wise similarity and multimodal models, to improve matching for non-template memes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meme-matching methods are limited to template-based memes, excluding many non-template formats and hindering comprehensive meme analysis and linking to web-based dictionaries.

Method: The study introduces a broader meme-matching formulation, evaluates conventional and segment-wise similarity measures, and explores a prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model.

Result: Segment-wise similarity outperforms whole-image measures for non-template memes, but accurate matching of memes via shared visual elements remains challenging.

Conclusion: More sophisticated techniques are needed to effectively match memes beyond template-based formats, as current methods fall short for non-template memes.

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LRDDv2, an enhanced dataset for long-range drone detection, featuring 39,516 annotated images with added range information for improved algorithm development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of UAVs necessitates reliable long-range detection, but existing datasets lack diversity and range-specific data.

Method: The authors expanded the LRDDv1 dataset to create LRDDv2, adding more diverse images and range information for 8,000+ images.

Result: LRDDv2 offers a comprehensive resource for drone detection, especially for small drones (≤50 pixels in 1080p) and includes range estimation capabilities.

Conclusion: LRDDv2 addresses gaps in drone detection research by providing a richer dataset, facilitating better algorithm development for long-range UAV detection.

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe
operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous
advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more
extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for
long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for
drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target
range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop
algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object
detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones
with 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution. For access to the complete

*Xunzhi Xiang,Yabo Chen,Guiyu Zhang,Zhongyu Wang,Zhe Gao,Quanming Xiang,Gonghu Shang,Junqi Liu,Haibin Huang,Yang Gao,Chi Zhang,Qi Fan,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a planning-then-populating framework (MMPL) for long video generation, addressing temporal drift and parallelization issues in autoregressive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive diffusion models struggle with long temporal durations due to error accumulation and lack of parallelization.

Method: MMPL uses Micro Planning for keyframes in segments and Macro Planning for global consistency, enabling parallel content generation.

Result: MMPL outperforms existing models in quality and stability for long video generation.

Conclusion: The proposed MMPL framework effectively addresses limitations of autoregressive models for long videos.

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated
videos and comparison results are in our project page.

*Tongshun Zhang,Pingping Liu,Zixuan Zhong,Zijian Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-stage method for detail recovery in dark images uses a Residual Fourier-Guided Module for global illumination and Mamba modules for texture refinement, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to preserve fine details and sharp edges in dark images, limiting their effectiveness in applications like text and edge detection.

Method: Proposes a dual-stage approach: (1) RFGM for global illumination in the frequency domain, and (2) Mamba modules (Patch and Grad) for texture refinement and edge reconstruction.

Result: Significantly improves detail recovery performance while maintaining efficiency, as shown in experiments on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The lightweight modules enhance detail recovery and can be integrated into existing frameworks with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

*Shaoguang Wang,Jianxiang He,Yijie Xu,Ziyang Chen,Weiyu Guo,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFP reduces token cost in Video-QA by pruning redundant frames and using a semantic graph, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High token cost and context dilution in MLLMs for Video-QA hinder practical use, prompting the need for frame optimization.

Method: Proposes AFP, an adaptive hierarchical clustering method for keyframe pruning, supplemented by a lightweight semantic graph.

Result: Reduces frames by 86.9% and tokens by 83.2%, often improving accuracy over baselines.

Conclusion: AFP effectively balances efficiency and performance in Video-QA, offering a practical solution for MLLMs.

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

### [128] [CIVQLLIE: Causal Intervention with Vector Quantization for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03338)
*Tongshun Zhang,Pingping Liu,Zhe Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIVQLLIE is a novel framework for low-light image enhancement using discrete representation learning and causal reasoning to address challenges in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLIE methods lack interpretability or rely on unreliable priors, while physics-based methods fail in complex real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses Vector Quantization (VQ) with multi-level causal intervention: Pixel-level Causal Intervention (PCI), Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) with LSAG, and High-frequency Detail Reconstruction Module (HDRM).

Result: Aligns degraded inputs with learned codebook, enhances generalization, and reconstructs fine details.

Conclusion: CIVQLLIE effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by combining discrete representation learning and causal intervention.

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

*Junlong Ren,Gangjian Zhang,Honghao Fu,Pengcheng Wu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaMo, a wavelet-based framework, improves text-motion retrieval by capturing part-specific and time-varying motion details, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to address the complexities of 3D motion-text alignment due to overlooking body part dynamics and spatial-temporal details.

Method: WaMo uses wavelet decomposition, reconstruction, and disordered sequence prediction to extract discriminative motion features for fine-grained alignment.

Result: Achieves 17.0% and 18.2% improvements in Rsum on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, surpassing SOTA methods.

Conclusion: WaMo effectively addresses motion-text alignment challenges, demonstrating superior performance in retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Matteo Caligiuri,Francesco Barbato,Donald Shenaj,Umberto Michieli,Pietro Zanuttigh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedPromo is a federated learning framework that efficiently adapts large foundation models to new domains using lightweight proxy models, reducing computational overhead while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional FL approaches struggle with large models due to high computational demands on client devices. FedPromo addresses this by optimizing lightweight models instead.

Method: FedPromo uses a two-stage process: server-side knowledge distillation to align large and compact models, followed by local training of classifiers on clients, which are aggregated and transferred back.

Result: FedPromo outperforms existing methods on five image classification benchmarks, demonstrating efficiency and performance with limited-resource clients.

Conclusion: FedPromo balances performance, privacy, and resource efficiency, enabling decentralized multi-domain learning without direct access to user data.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

TL;DR: Proposes Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), an efficient all-in-one image restoration method using one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion models, outperforming existing approaches in quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are costly and lack adaptability to diverse degradation types, prompting the need for an efficient solution.

Method: Introduces multi-degradation feature modulation and parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation to fine-tune Stable Diffusion models, plus a detail enhancement module.

Result: Outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration methods in visual quality and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: DOD achieves superior restoration with minimal computational cost, making it practical for diverse degradation types.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

*Keyi Li,Alexander Jaus,Jens Kleesiek,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRASP enhances pathology segmentation by integrating anatomical context without retraining, achieving top performance on PET/CT datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods ignore anatomical context, limiting accuracy in pathology segmentation.

Method: GRASP uses pseudolabel integration and feature alignment to leverage anatomy segmentation models, avoiding auxiliary training.

Result: GRASP ranks top in multiple metrics and architectures, with its dual anatomy injection strategy proving effective.

Conclusion: GRASP successfully integrates anatomical context into pathology segmentation, improving performance without additional training.

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitAdapter introduces a continual learning approach for gait recognition, avoiding retraining pitfalls by using graph neural networks and a Euclidean Distance Stability Method to preserve knowledge across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gait recognition models lose performance on older datasets when retrained on new ones, necessitating a method to retain and enhance knowledge progressively.

Method: GaitAdapter employs the GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module with graph neural networks and the Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) to maintain feature discriminability across tasks.

Result: GaitAdapter outperforms other methods by effectively retaining gait knowledge from diverse tasks and enhancing discriminative capability.

Conclusion: GaitAdapter provides a robust solution for continual gait recognition, preserving knowledge and improving performance across evolving datasets.

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NAVIA, a method for Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA) in Vision Transformers (ViTs), addressing the trade-off between performance and computational cost by neutralizing token aggregation via information augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods for ViTs are computationally expensive, and token aggregation, while reducing latency, degrades performance. The paper aims to solve this ETTA challenge.

Method: Proposes NAVIA, which augments the [CLS] token embedding and incorporates adaptive biases in shallow ViT layers to recover information lost due to token aggregation, optimized via entropy minimization.

Result: NAVIA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5% in performance and reduces inference latency by more than 20% across out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: NAVIA effectively balances adaptation capability and computational efficiency, making it a practical solution for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

*Xinzhu Li,Juepeng Zheng,Yikun Chen,Xudong Mao,Guanghui Yue,Wei Zhou,Chenlei Lv,Ruomei Wang,Fan Zhou,Baoquan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthGait introduces RGB-derived depth maps and silhouettes for robust gait recognition, outperforming existing methods with a novel fusion scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D representations like silhouettes and skeletons lack sufficient detail for viewpoint variations and finer gait details.

Method: DepthGait estimates depth maps from RGB sequences and combines them with silhouettes using a multi-scale, cross-level fusion scheme.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with high rank-1 accuracy on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: DepthGait effectively enhances gait recognition by leveraging depth maps and advanced fusion techniques.

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

*Pingchuan Ma,Xiaopei Yang,Yusong Li,Ming Gui,Felix Krause,Johannes Schusterbauer,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCFlow proposes a flow-matching framework to invertibly merge style and content, enabling natural disentanglement without explicit supervision, and demonstrates strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in disentangling style and content due to semantic overlap and subjectivity led to exploring invertible merging as an alternative to explicit separation.

Method: SCFlow uses flow matching to learn bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled representations, avoiding restrictive priors and leveraging a synthetic dataset.

Result: SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot settings, showing competitive performance and emergent disentanglement.

Conclusion: Invertible merging of style and content can naturally lead to disentanglement, bypassing the need for explicit separation methods.

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hyperspectral unmixing method, STVMLU, combines sparsity and total variation constraints with multilayer matrix factorization for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral unmixing is crucial for preprocessing in hyperspectral imagery, requiring accurate estimation of material signatures and proportions.

Method: STVMLU integrates a TV constraint for spatial similarity and an L1/2-norm for sparsity, optimized via ADMM.

Result: STVMLU outperforms other algorithms in experimental tests.

Conclusion: The proposed STVMLU method enhances hyperspectral unmixing accuracy by leveraging spatial and sparsity constraints.

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

TL;DR: MACT is a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework for visual document understanding and VQA, outperforming existing models with smaller parameters and better handling of long visual contexts and complex reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs are limited by parameter scale, lack self-correction, and struggle with long visual contexts and complex reasoning, especially in document tasks.

Method: MACT uses four specialized agents (planning, execution, judgment, answer) with mixed reward modeling and agent-wise hybrid test-time scaling.

Result: MACT excels in benchmarks, leading in 13 of 15 tests and maintaining top three average scores across variants.

Conclusion: MACT offers superior performance in document-based and general tasks, demonstrating scalability and robustness without large parameter overhead.

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

*Diana-Nicoleta Grigore,Neelu Madan,Andreas Mogelmose,Thomas B. Moeslund,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotMatch, a knowledge distillation framework, transfers object-centric representations from a teacher to a lightweight student, outperforming the teacher with fewer parameters and faster speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised video segmentation lacks supervisory signals and often requires complex models. SlotMatch simplifies this by distilling knowledge without additional objectives.

Method: SlotMatch aligns teacher and student slots via cosine similarity, avoiding extra losses or supervision.

Result: The student model matches or outperforms the teacher (SlotContrast) with 3.6x fewer parameters and 1.9x faster speed, surpassing prior models.

Conclusion: SlotMatch is a simple, effective framework for unsupervised video segmentation, offering efficiency and performance gains.

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

TL;DR: Fd-CycleGAN improves image-to-image translation by enhancing latent representation learning with Local Neighborhood Encoding and frequency-aware supervision, outperforming CycleGAN and other methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in CycleGAN by better approximating real data distributions through improved latent representation learning, capturing fine-grained local semantics and structural coherence.

Method: Integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision with distribution-based loss metrics (KL/JS divergence, log-based similarity) to align real and generated image distributions.

Result: Superior perceptual quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, especially in low-data regimes, validated on Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and Strike-off datasets.

Conclusion: Fd-CycleGAN's frequency-guided latent learning enhances generalization, making it effective for tasks like document restoration, style transfer, and medical image synthesis, with advantages over diffusion models in efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-modal medical knowledge graph (M3KG) and a framework for X-ray report generation, addressing challenges like hallucination and weak disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of X-ray medical report generation by leveraging large foundation models and addressing persistent issues like hallucination and diagnostic limitations.

Method: Constructs M3KG using GPT-4o, samples it for multi-granularity semantic graphs, uses R-GCN for feature extraction, Swin-Transformer for vision features, and cross-attention for knowledge interaction. A Q-former retrieves disease-aware tokens, and an LLM maps inputs to language descriptions.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge graph and framework.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances X-ray report generation, with the source code made available for further use.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source

*Hongjun Liu,Chao Yao,Yalan Zhang,Xiaokun wang,Xiaojuan Ban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMAC introduces a self-supervised framework for EEG signal classification, addressing cross-domain data shifts via spatial time series imputation and channel-dependent masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous EEG data due to varying electrode configurations, protocols, and hardware cause distribution shifts, challenging classification accuracy.

Method: IMAC standardizes electrode layouts, uses spatio-temporal signal alignment with channel-dependent masking, and disentangles temporal/spatial modeling.

Result: IMAC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in cross-subject/cross-center scenarios, with up to 35% improvement in robustness.

Conclusion: IMAC effectively addresses EEG data shifts, offering superior performance and robustness in diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

*Ning Zhu,Xiaochuan Ma,Shaoting Zhang,Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedCAL-Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating Foundation Models (FMs) in Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) for medical image analysis, covering 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across diverse tasks and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and limitations of existing CSAL methods relying on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) by leveraging pre-trained FMs for better feature extraction and sample selection.

Method: Proposes MedCAL-Bench, evaluating 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets for classification and segmentation tasks under varying annotation budgets.

Result: 1) DINO family excels in segmentation; 2) FM performance varies more in segmentation than classification; 3) ALPS and RepDiv are top strategies for segmentation and classification, respectively.

Conclusion: FMs are effective for CSAL, with performance varying by task and dataset, highlighting the need for tailored strategies.

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies an instability in flow-based generative models due to early-step sensitivity to guidance scale, proposes a RATIO-aware adaptive guidance schedule to mitigate it, and demonstrates faster, high-quality generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the instability in flow-based generative models caused by early-step sensitivity to guidance scale, which affects generation quality and speed.

Method: Theoretical analysis and empirical validation of the RATIO spike, followed by proposing a lightweight, adaptive guidance schedule using exponential decay.

Result: The proposed method enables up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality, robustness, and semantic alignment.

Conclusion: Stepwise guidance adaptation is crucial for optimizing fast flow-based generative models, as demonstrated by the success of the RATIO-aware schedule.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

TL;DR: CoPS enhances zero-shot anomaly detection by synthesizing dynamic prompts conditioned on visual features, improving generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods for zero-shot anomaly detection struggle with static tokens and sparse labels, limiting generalization and causing overfitting.

Method: CoPS synthesizes dynamic prompts using visual features, extracts normal/anomaly prototypes, and fuses class tokens via a variational autoencoder. A spatially-aware alignment mechanism is also integrated.

Result: CoPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.5% AUROC in classification and segmentation across 13 datasets.

Conclusion: CoPS effectively addresses limitations in prompt learning for zero-shot anomaly detection, offering superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

*Xuan Dong,Xiangyuan Sun,Xia Wang,Jian Song,Ya Li,Weixin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-camera framework is proposed to address moire patterns in videos by using synchronized focused and defocused captures, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing demoireing methods struggle to distinguish moire patterns from real textures and maintain tonal/temporal consistency.

Method: A dual-camera setup captures synchronized videos (focused and defocused). A frame-wise pipeline uses optical flow alignment, multi-scale CNN, and joint bilateral filtering for demoireing.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art demoireing methods.

Conclusion: The dual-camera approach effectively addresses moire artifacts while preserving texture and consistency.

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

*Zilin Chen,Shengnan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVPDN is a novel framework for polyp detection in colonoscopy videos, addressing challenges like rapid camera movement and noise with adaptive feature and scale-aware modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate polyp detection is crucial for early colorectal cancer diagnosis, but colonoscopy videos' dynamic nature introduces noise and false positives.

Method: AVPDN uses AFIA for feature enhancement (triple-branch architecture with self-attention and channel shuffle) and SACI for multi-scale context integration (dilated convolutions).

Result: AVPDN achieves competitive performance on public benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in video-based polyp detection.

Conclusion: AVPDN offers a robust solution for polyp detection in noisy colonoscopy videos, improving accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IKOD, a lightweight decoding strategy, mitigates hallucinations in LVLMs by merging image-focused logits from shorter sequences, improving performance without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from increasing hallucinations with sequence length due to diminishing visual attention, but the cause is unclear.

Method: Proposes IKOD, which merges logits from shorter sequences with higher image attention to counteract attention degradation.

Result: IKOD effectively reduces hallucinations and enhances LVLM performance without added computational cost.

Conclusion: IKOD is a practical, efficient solution for improving LVLM outputs by addressing attention degradation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

*Junjie Cao,Kaizhou Li,Xinchun Yu,Hongxiang Li,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGuard is a method to protect videos from unauthorized editing by introducing subtle perturbations that disrupt generative diffusion models, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative technology poses risks of misuse for misleading activities, with video content lacking adequate protection compared to images.

Method: VideoGuard uses joint frame optimization and incorporates video motion information to create perturbations that disrupt generative models.

Result: The method effectively prevents unauthorized editing, with superior performance demonstrated through objective and subjective metrics.

Conclusion: VideoGuard successfully bridges the protection gap for videos, offering a robust solution against malicious generative model misuse.

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and

### [150] [When Cars Have Stereotypes: Auditing Demographic Bias in Objects from Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03483)
*Dasol Choi Jihwan Lee,Minjae Lee,Minsuk Kahng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates demographic biases in text-to-image generation, focusing on objects (e.g., cars) rather than humans. It introduces SODA, a framework to measure these biases, revealing associations between demographic cues and visual attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research focused on biases in human depictions, but this study addresses the overlooked issue of demographic bias in generated objects, aiming to uncover and mitigate such biases in AI models.

Method: The study uses SODA to compare visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., 'for young people') versus neutral prompts. It analyzes 2,700 images from three models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, Stable Diffusion) across five object categories.

Result: The analysis reveals strong associations between demographic groups and visual attributes, including recurring color patterns linked to gender or ethnicity. Some models produce less diverse outputs, amplifying visual disparities.

Conclusion: The SODA framework highlights embedded stereotypes in generative models, advocating for systematic auditing to promote responsible AI development.

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

*Lianwei Yang,Haokun Lin,Tianchen Zhao,Yichen Wu,Hongyu Zhu,Ruiqi Xie,Zhenan Sun,Yu Wang,Qingyi Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRQ-DiT is a post-training quantization framework for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) that addresses weight and activation outliers, improving efficiency without degrading performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs are computationally expensive and large, making them impractical for resource-constrained scenarios. Existing PTQ methods fail under low-bit settings due to weight distribution and activation outliers.

Method: Proposes Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ) for weights and Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) for activations to mitigate quantization errors and outliers.

Result: LRQ-DiT outperforms existing PTQ methods, preserving image quality under low-bit settings on datasets like COCO, MJHQ, and sDCI.

Conclusion: LRQ-DiT effectively quantizes DiTs, balancing efficiency and performance, making them viable for resource-limited applications.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

*Yu Zhou,Pelle Thielmann,Ayush Chamoli,Bruno Mirbach,Didier Stricker,Jason Rambach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ParticleSAM adapts a segmentation foundation model for small, dense particles in construction materials, using a new dataset for benchmarking, outperforming the original SAM method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual quality monitoring of recycled construction materials is inefficient; vision-based ML can automate this but lacks methods for small-particle segmentation.

Method: Proposes ParticleSAM, an adaptation of a segmentation foundation model, and creates a dense multi-particle dataset using an automated pipeline.

Result: ParticleSAM outperforms the original SAM method in both quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: ParticleSAM offers a scalable solution for small-particle segmentation, applicable beyond construction, with validated performance.

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

### [153] [Quality Versus Sparsity in Image Recovery by Dictionary Learning Using Iterative Shrinkage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03492)
*Mohammadsadegh Khoshghiaferezaee,Moritz Krauth,Shima Shabani,Michael Breuß*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores sparsity in sparse dictionary learning (SDL) for image recovery, showing that high sparsity doesn't compromise quality and varies by optimization method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how sparsity enforcement in SDL affects recovery quality without degrading results.

Method: Analyzes sparsity regimes using various optimization methods for SDL in image recovery.

Result: Different methods yield varying sparsity levels, and high sparsity doesn't harm recovery quality.

Conclusion: High sparsity is achievable without compromising image recovery quality, even with deviations from the learning database.

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

### [154] [Prototype-Enhanced Confidence Modeling for Cross-Modal Medical Image-Report Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03494)
*Shreyank N Gowda,Xiaobo Jin,Christian Wagner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Prototype-Enhanced Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework to improve cross-modal retrieval in medical data by addressing ambiguity and variability. It achieves state-of-the-art results with up to 10.17% performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate alignment of medical images with text reports is challenging due to ambiguity and variability. Existing models fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships, leading to unreliable retrieval.

Method: PECM uses multi-level prototypes for each modality and a dual-stream confidence estimation with adaptive weighting to handle uncertainty and enhance robustness.

Result: The method significantly improves retrieval precision and consistency, achieving up to 10.17% performance gains on radiology datasets.

Conclusion: PECM effectively addresses data ambiguity and variability, advancing reliability in clinical cross-modal retrieval tasks.

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

### [155] [EditGarment: An Instruction-Based Garment Editing Dataset Constructed with Automated MLLM Synthesis and Semantic-Aware Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03497)
*Deqiang Yin,Junyi Guo,Huanda Lu,Fangyu Wu,Dongming Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated pipeline to create a garment editing dataset (EditGarment) due to the lack of high-quality instruction-image pairs, addressing challenges like imprecise instruction modeling and fashion-specific supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Garment editing via natural language requires understanding garment-specific semantics, but progress is hindered by scarce high-quality data and inadequate supervision.

Method: The authors define six editing instruction categories and introduce Fashion Edit Score for semantic-aware evaluation, constructing 20,596 high-quality instruction-image triplets.

Result: The pipeline produces EditGarment, a dataset of 20,596 triplets, tailored for garment editing.

Conclusion: The work advances garment editing by providing a scalable, high-quality dataset and a semantic-aware evaluation metric.

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

*Yazhou Zhu,Haofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free CD-FSMIS model using MAUP strategy adapts SAM for medical image segmentation without additional training, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CD-FSMIS models require heavy training, limiting universality and deployment ease. Leveraging large visual models like SAM offers a solution.

Method: MAUP strategy includes multi-center prompts generation, uncertainty-aware selection, and adaptive optimization to adapt SAM for medical segmentation.

Result: Achieves precise segmentation across three medical datasets without training, outperforming conventional CD-FSMIS and training-free FSMIS models.

Conclusion: MAUP effectively adapts SAM for CD-FSMIS, offering a training-free, high-performance solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

*Shiben Liu,Mingyue Xu,Huijie Fan,Qiang Wang,Yandong Tang,Zhi Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DKUA, a framework for lifelong person re-identification (LReID) that addresses knowledge retention and adaptation by integrating domain-specific and cross-domain learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LReID methods lack awareness of specific distributions and unified cross-domain knowledge, limiting their ability to balance old knowledge preservation and new information adaptation.

Method: DKUA includes domain-style modeling, adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC), unified knowledge association (UKA), and distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) to enhance anti-forgetting and generalization.

Result: DKUA achieves 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement over existing methods in anti-forgetting and generalization.

Conclusion: The DKUA framework effectively addresses the challenges of LReID by combining domain-specific and cross-domain learning, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticStitcher uses latent features from a histopathology foundation model to automate tissue fragment stitching, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated stitching of large tissue samples is challenging due to preparation artifacts and distortions, limiting current methods.

Method: Uses latent feature representations from a visual histopathology model for semantic matching and robust pose estimation to create whole mount slides.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in boundary matches across three datasets.

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher provides robust and accurate stitching for histopathology samples.

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoEmoGen is a pipeline for generating emotionally faithful and semantically coherent images using multimodal LLMs and a HiLoRA module, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) struggle with abstract emotions and rely on flawed word-level labels, leading to semantic incoherence and limited scalability.

Method: CoEmoGen uses multimodal LLMs for high-quality emotion-triggering captions and a HiLoRA module to model polarity-shared and emotion-specific features.

Result: CoEmoGen excels in emotional faithfulness and semantic coherence, validated by quantitative, qualitative, and user studies.

Conclusion: CoEmoGen offers a scalable solution for EICG, supported by the EmoArt dataset, advancing emotion-driven artistic creation.

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of
emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for
emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at

*Inamullah,Imran Razzak,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores links between serum lipid subclasses and retinal microvascular traits, finding specific correlations that suggest retinal imaging could serve as a non-invasive marker for metabolic health.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequate understanding of the association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature, this study investigates their relationships in a healthy cohort.

Method: Spearman correlation analysis was used to examine connections between lipid subclasses (FA, DAG, TAG, CE) and retinal microvascular traits, with BH-FDR adjustment for significance.

Result: FA correlated with vessel twistiness, CE with artery/vein widths, while DAG and TAG negatively correlated with arteriole/venule width and complexity.

Conclusion: Retinal vascular architecture reflects distinct lipid profiles, supporting its use as a non-invasive metabolic health marker, independent of disease or treatment effects.

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

TL;DR: ARAS introduces a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis method to improve defect realism and semantic control, integrated with QARAD for enhanced anomaly detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly synthesis methods suffer from structural deficiencies like micro-structural discontinuities and limited controllability.

Method: ARAS uses token-anchored latent editing, a hard-gated auto-regressive operator, and a context-preserving masked sampling kernel. QARAD employs dynamic weighting based on image-text similarity.

Result: QARAD outperforms SOTA methods in anomaly detection, achieving better accuracy, robustness, and 5x faster synthesis than diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: ARAS and QARAD offer improved anomaly synthesis and detection, with public availability of code and datasets.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: A new open-source dataset for converting spoken math to LaTeX is introduced, addressing gaps in prior work and achieving competitive performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of converting spoken math to LaTeX is underexplored despite its educational and research applications. Prior work has limitations like small datasets and lack of multilingual support.

Method: The authors create a large-scale dataset (66,000+ samples in English and Russian) and use ASR post-correction, few-shot prompting, and audio language models.

Result: Their models achieve comparable CER (28% vs. 30%) on MathSpeech and outperform it by 40+ points on S2L-equations (27% vs. 64%). They also set a benchmark for math sentence recognition (40% CER).

Conclusion: This work advances multimodal AI for math content recognition and provides a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for
LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for
mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER
of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI,
with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

TL;DR: Drones with thermal and RGB imagery efficiently estimate wildlife density in Austria, yielding higher densities than camera traps, offering scalable and non-intrusive monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wildlife density methods like camera traps are labor-intensive or spatially limited; drones provide a more efficient and scalable alternative.

Method: Drones surveyed areas using thermal and RGB imagery at 60 m altitude, with systematic transects. Animal counts were manually annotated and extrapolated using three methods. Camera trap data (REM) was compared.

Result: Drone methods showed higher densities than REM, except in one area, reflecting daytime activity in open/forested zones versus REM's longer-term forest averages.

Conclusion: Drones are a promising, scalable tool for wildlife density estimation, complementing traditional methods with different activity insights.

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable, efficient pipeline for extracting building footprints from rural historical maps using hierarchical ML, validated on Irish Ordnance Survey maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational intensity and urban bias of prior methods to enable analysis of rural regions for historical and archaeological research.

Method: Hierarchical ML approach: CNN classifiers filter out low-probability map sections, followed by CNN segmentation on high-probability areas.

Result: High performance and efficiency, identifying a potentially abandoned settlement in Tully, Co. Galway.

Conclusion: The pipeline is effective for rural historical map analysis, aiding discoveries like abandoned settlements.

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2-UNeXT enhances SAM2-UNet by integrating a DINOv2 encoder and dual-resolution strategy for better segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the generalizability and performance of SAM for downstream tasks by addressing the challenge of constructing a more powerful encoder.

Method: Proposes SAM2-UNeXT, integrating a DINOv2 encoder, dual-resolution strategy, and dense glue layer for simpler yet accurate segmentation.

Result: Outperforms benchmarks in dichotomous image segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and remote sensing saliency detection.

Conclusion: SAM2-UNeXT offers superior performance with a simple architecture, reducing the need for complex decoders.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadProPoser is a probabilistic encoder-decoder for radar-based human pose estimation, handling noisy data and predicting joint uncertainties, achieving 6.425 cm MPJPE and reliable uncertainty calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar-based HPE is privacy-preserving and illumination-invariant but suffers from noisy, multipath-affected measurements, necessitating robust solutions.

Method: Uses variational inference in a probabilistic encoder-decoder to process radar tensors, predicting 3D joint locations and uncertainties with Gaussian/Laplace distributions.

Result: Achieves 6.425 cm MPJPE, strong uncertainty alignment, and 0.870 F1 score for activity classification via data augmentation.

Conclusion: First end-to-end radar HPE system modeling per-joint uncertainty, enabling reliable and explainable human motion analysis.

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetaScope, a neural network for metalens endoscopy, addressing optical issues like intensity decay and chromatic aberration, and demonstrates superior performance in segmentation and restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Miniaturized endoscopy faces limitations with conventional lenses; metalenses offer promise but lack research in data acquisition and algorithms. This work bridges that gap.

Method: MetaScope uses Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment (OIA) and Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), guided by physical optics, and employs gradient-guided distillation for joint learning.

Result: MetaScope outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration and shows strong generalization in biomedical applications.

Conclusion: MetaScope advances metalens endoscopy by addressing optical challenges and achieving superior performance, paving the way for future clinical applications.

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static fusion and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance.

Method: Introduces input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck, dual dynamic attention, and class-aware feature adaptation.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in precision and mAP, maintains efficiency (11.1M parameters), and adapts to real-world challenges.

Conclusion: DyCAF-Net is a robust solution for real-world detection tasks in dynamic and imbalanced environments.

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

TL;DR: CloudBreaker generates high-quality multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data, overcoming cloud and nighttime limitations in satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions restrict multi-spectral imagery availability, while Sentinel-1 radar data is unaffected by these issues.

Method: Uses a multi-stage training approach with conditional latent flow matching and integrates cosine scheduling with flow matching.

Result: Achieves FID score of 0.7432, SSIM of 0.6156 for NDWI, and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating high fidelity and structural similarity.

Conclusion: CloudBreaker is a promising solution for remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is unreliable or unavailable.

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces evTransFER, a transfer learning framework for face expression recognition using event-based cameras, achieving a 93.6% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras capture high-temporal-resolution data, but recognizing facial expressions with them is challenging. The goal is to improve accuracy using transfer learning and novel architectures.

Method: Proposes evTransFER, a transfer learning framework with a feature extractor trained via adversarial generative methods for facial reconstruction, then transferred to expression recognition. Incorporates an LSTM and a new event-based representation (TIE).

Result: Achieves 93.6% recognition rate on e-CK+ database, a 25.9% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Transfer learning and the proposed architecture significantly enhance facial expression recognition with event-based cameras.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

Abstract: We introduce FPG-NAS, a FLOPs-aware Gated Differentiable Neural Architecture
Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D
rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet
remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in
resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a
specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a
task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables
discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural
diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search
space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.
Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived

Result: Achieves 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on ScanNet, enabling high-fidelity novel view synthesis and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Uni3R introduces a scalable, generalizable paradigm for unified 3D scene reconstruction and understanding.

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To estimate object pose and full shape from a single observation without relying on known 3D models or categories.

Method: Decouples shape completion into two multi-modal distributions: one for measurements in a normalized reference frame and another for object geometries as triplanar neural fields. Uses conditional diffusion models for each distribution.

Result: Demonstrates compelling performance on challenging real-world datasets.

Conclusion: OmniShape is the first method to enable probabilistic pose and shape estimation, achieving strong results.

Abstract: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single

completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by

TL;DR: Veila is a conditional diffusion framework for generating controllable panoramic LiDAR data using monocular RGB images, addressing challenges like unreliable conditioning, modality gaps, and structural coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained spatial control or rely on text-guided synthesis, which is insufficient for scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: Veila integrates Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism (CACM), Geometric Cross-Modal Alignment (GCMA), and Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) to enhance RGB-LiDAR alignment and structural consistency.

Result: Veila achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency, improving downstream LiDAR semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Veila provides a scalable and low-cost solution for realistic and controllable LiDAR data generation, addressing key challenges in cross-modal alignment and coherence.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: La La LiDAR sets a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation, offering customizable control while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency.

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models

Motivation: Existing generative world models for autonomous driving overlook LiDAR properties, lacking controllability, temporal coherence, and standardized evaluation.

Method: LiDARCrafter parses natural language into ego-centric scene graphs, conditioning a tri-branch diffusion network for object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. It includes an autoregressive module for temporal coherence.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes show LiDARCrafter excels in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter advances 4D LiDAR generation, enabling data augmentation and simulation, with released code and benchmark.

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video generation struggle with long videos due to temporal inconsistency and visual degradation.

Method: LongVie uses unified noise initialization, global control signal normalization, multi-modal control, and degradation-aware training.

Result: LongVie achieves state-of-the-art performance in controllability, consistency, and quality, validated on LongVGenBench.

Conclusion: LongVie effectively addresses challenges in long video generation, offering a robust solution with superior performance.

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100
high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,
each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and
quality.

Method: Uses semantic-aware sampling for point distribution and a motion modeling framework (HoD for intra-trajectory dynamics and inter-trajectory relationships). Combines trajectory tokens with semantic features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks: Something-Something-V2, Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym.

Conclusion: Trokens effectively enhances appearance features with motion information, improving few-shot action recognition.

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

*Jean-Francois Chamberland,Martin C. Carlisle,Arul Jayaraman,Krishna R. Narayanan,Sunay Palsole,Karan Watson*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: An AI-supported framework for scalable evaluation of teaching effectiveness in large engineering programs, using LLMs to analyze student feedback and provide actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of evaluating teaching effectiveness at scale in large universities, where traditional methods are impractical and inconsistent.

Method: Hierarchical summarization, anonymization, and exception handling with LLMs to synthesize qualitative feedback, combined with visual analytics for contextual insights.

Result: Successful deployment in a large engineering college, with validation showing LLM-generated summaries reliably support formative evaluation and professional development.

Conclusion: AI systems, designed transparently and with shared governance, can enhance teaching excellence and continuous improvement in academic institutions.

Abstract: Evaluating teaching effectiveness at scale remains a persistent challenge for
large universities, particularly within engineering programs that enroll tens
of thousands of students. Traditional methods, such as manual review of student
evaluations, are often impractical, leading to overlooked insights and
inconsistent data use. This article presents a scalable, AI-supported framework
for synthesizing qualitative student feedback using large language models. The
system employs hierarchical summarization, anonymization, and exception
handling to extract actionable themes from open-ended comments while upholding
ethical safeguards. Visual analytics contextualize numeric scores through
percentile-based comparisons, historical trends, and instructional load. The
approach supports meaningful evaluation and aligns with best practices in
qualitative analysis and educational assessment, incorporating student, peer,
and self-reflective inputs without automating personnel decisions. We report on
its successful deployment across a large college of engineering. Preliminary
validation through comparisons with human reviewers, faculty feedback, and
longitudinal analysis suggests that LLM-generated summaries can reliably
support formative evaluation and professional development. This work
demonstrates how AI systems, when designed with transparency and shared
governance, can promote teaching excellence and continuous improvement at scale
within academic institutions.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the impact of UAD 3.6's 2026 implementation on property valuation, proposing an AI-augmented framework to address technical and trust challenges while restructuring the market.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address institutional failures in property valuation (e.g., biases, variability) and leverage AI advancements for regulatory compliance and market efficiency.

Method: Develops a three-layer AI framework (data acquisition, semantic understanding, cognitive reasoning) integrating emerging technologies with professional oversight.

Result: Identifies how regulatory-AI convergence can restructure markets, improve efficiency, and mitigate systemic risk, emphasizing human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: Successful transformation requires balancing technological sophistication with professional oversight to augment expertise and address historical biases.

Abstract: The Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6's mandatory 2026 implementation
transforms residential property valuation from narrative reporting to
structured, machine-readable formats. This paper provides the first
comprehensive analysis of this regulatory shift alongside concurrent AI
advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous
systems. We develop a three-layer framework for AI-augmented valuation
addressing technical implementation and institutional trust requirements. Our
analysis reveals how regulatory standardization converging with AI capabilities
enables fundamental market restructuring with profound implications for
professional practice, efficiency, and systemic risk. We make four key
contributions: (1) documenting institutional failures including inter-appraiser
variability and systematic biases undermining valuation reliability; (2)
developing an architectural framework spanning physical data acquisition,
semantic understanding, and cognitive reasoning that integrates emerging
technologies while maintaining professional oversight; (3) addressing trust
requirements for high-stakes financial applications including regulatory
compliance, algorithmic fairness, and uncertainty quantification; (4) proposing
evaluation methodologies beyond generic AI benchmarks toward domain-specific
protocols. Our findings indicate successful transformation requires not merely
technological sophistication but careful human-AI collaboration, creating
systems that augment rather than replace professional expertise while
addressing historical biases and information asymmetries in real estate
markets.

TL;DR: SecoustiCodec is a low-bitrate streaming speech codec that disentangles semantic and paralinguistic information, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech codecs struggle with semantic encoding due to residual paralinguistic information, incomplete semantics, limited reconstruction, and lack of streaming support.

Method: Proposes a cross-modal aligned codec using VAE and FSQ for quantization, contrastive learning for semantic disentanglement, and multi-stage optimization for convergence.

Result: Achieves PESQ scores of 1.77/2.58 at 0.27/1 kbps, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SecoustiCodec effectively addresses challenges in speech codecs and will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as a crucial bridge in unifying speech and text language
models. Existing codec methods face several challenges in semantic encoding,
such as residual paralinguistic information (e.g., timbre, emotion),
insufficient semantic completeness, limited reconstruction capability, and lack
of support for streaming. To address these challenges, we propose
SecoustiCodec, a cross-modal aligned low-bitrate streaming speech codec that
disentangles semantic and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook
space. To ensure semantic completeness and reconstruction fidelity,
paralinguistic encoding is introduced to bridge the information gap between
semantic and acoustic encoding. A semantic-only efficient quantization method
based on VAE (Variational Autoencoder) and FSQ (Finite Scalar Quantization) is
proposed. This approach alleviates the long-tail distribution problem of tokens
while maintaining high codebook utilization. A semantic disentanglement method
based on contrastive learning is proposed, which aligns text and speech in a
joint multimodal frame-level space, effectively removing paralinguistic
information from semantic encoding. An acoustic-constrained multi-stage
optimization strategy is proposed to ensure robust and stable convergence.
Figure~\ref{fig:pesq_kbps_below_2kbps} shows SecoustiCodec achieves SOTA
(state-of-the-art) reconstruction quality (PESQ) of 1.77/2.58 at 0.27/1 kbps.
The code and model weights for SecoustiCodec will be open-sourced upon the
completion of the peer-review process. We've open-sourced SecoustiCodec's demo,
code, and model weights.

*Kisu Yang,Yoonna Jang,Hwanseok Jang,Kenneth Choi,Isabelle Augenstein,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper addresses spurious ties in low-precision retrieval systems by proposing High-Precision Scoring (HPS) and Tie-aware Retrieval Metrics (TRM) for more reliable evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-precision computations in retrieval systems introduce spurious ties, causing high variability in results and unreliable evaluation.

Method: Proposes HPS (upcasting final scoring to higher precision) and TRM (reporting expected scores, range, and bias) to mitigate ties and quantify uncertainty.

Result: HPS reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately recovers expected metric values in experiments across multiple models and datasets.

Conclusion: The combination of HPS and TRM enables consistent and reliable evaluation for low-precision retrievals.

Abstract: Lowering the numerical precision of model parameters and computations is
widely adopted to improve the efficiency of retrieval systems. However, when
computing relevance scores between the query and documents in low-precision, we
observe spurious ties due to the reduced granularity. This introduces high
variability in the results based on tie resolution, making the evaluation less
reliable. To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation
protocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision
Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to
resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware
Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to
quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple
models with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate
that HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately
recovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and
reliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MultiRAG is a framework to reduce hallucination in multi-source RAG by addressing sparse data and source inconsistencies via knowledge-guided methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle hallucination issues in LLMs caused by multi-source retrieval challenges like sparse data and inconsistent information.

Method: Introduces a knowledge construction module with multi-source line graphs and a retrieval module with multi-level confidence calculations.

Result: Significantly improves reliability and efficiency in multi-source knowledge retrieval, validated on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: MultiRAG effectively mitigates hallucination in multi-source RAG, enhancing LLM performance.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to
address hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative,
introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination
problems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse
distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical
relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that
lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose
MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source
retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our
framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module
that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical
relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the
sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that
implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both
graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable
information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source
inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and
two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the
reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source
scenarios. \textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PyLate, a library for multi-vector neural ranking models, addressing limitations of single-vector approaches and enhancing retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-vector search compresses information into one vector, degrading performance in complex tasks. Multi-vector methods like ColBERT show promise but lack accessible tools.

Method: PyLate is built on Sentence Transformers, supporting multi-vector architectures with minimal code changes and offering features like efficient indexes.

Result: PyLate enables state-of-the-art models (e.g., GTE-ModernColBERT, Reason-ModernColBERT), proving its utility in research and production.

Conclusion: PyLate bridges the gap in multi-vector model adoption, unlocking their potential in modern information retrieval systems.

Abstract: Neural ranking has become a cornerstone of modern information retrieval.
While single vector search remains the dominant paradigm, it suffers from the
shortcoming of compressing all the information into a single vector. This
compression leads to notable performance degradation in out-of-domain,
long-context, and reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Multi-vector approaches
pioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual
token embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This
architecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced
out-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex
retrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear
theoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late
interaction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts,
primarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and
experimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a
streamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support
multi-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training,
advanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal
code changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering
multi-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to
accelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models,
thereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems. Finally, PyLate
has already enabled the development of state-of-the-art models, including
GTE-ModernColBERT and Reason-ModernColBERT, demonstrating its practical utility
for both research and production environments.

TL;DR: VRPO, a value-centric framework, improves RLHF robustness by enhancing the value model's noise-filtering and key-word capture abilities, outperforming PPO and GRPO in noisy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy or imperfect reward supervision in RLHF undermines policy stability and generalization, often overlooked in prior work focusing on reward denoising.

Method: VRPO introduces an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a frozen language model and a variational information bottleneck to strengthen the value model.

Result: VRPO outperforms PPO and GRPO baselines in math reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue under noisy rewards.

Conclusion: The value model is crucial in RLHF for noise mitigation, and VRPO provides a principled approach for robust policy optimization in noisy environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or
imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy
stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on
key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward
denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the
value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value
model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and
enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric
framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two
core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a
frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These
mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture
key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a
passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math
reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and
model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO
baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value
model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy
optimization in noisy real-world environments.

*Yubo Wang,Shimin Di,Zhili Wang,Haoyang Li,Fei Teng,Hao Xin,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models' performance stems from their base KGE model or extension modules. Decomposing HKGs into KGs shows some KGE models match HKGE performance, but decomposition alters HKG topology. Current HKGE models struggle with long-range dependencies and qualifier integration. The proposed FormerGNN framework addresses these issues and outperforms existing HKGE models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if HKGE models' success is due to their base KGE model or extension modules, and to address limitations in current HKGE models regarding topology preservation and information integration.

Method: Decompose HKGs into KGs using three methods, evaluate classical KGE models, and propose the FormerGNN framework with a qualifier integrator and GNN-based encoder.

Result: Some KGE models perform comparably to HKGE models, but decomposition alters HKG topology. FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

Conclusion: Decomposition methods and current HKGE models have limitations. FormerGNN offers a promising direction for future HKGE research by preserving topology and improving information integration.

Abstract: Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an
extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world
facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to
adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing
extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the
superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their
base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this
paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods
and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our
results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of
HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods
alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.
Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in
capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate
main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.
To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE
research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a
qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based
graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an
improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to
mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that
FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

TL;DR: The paper applies Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn interactions in software engineering, improving success rates on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL applications to LLMs focus on single-turn tasks, but real-world domains like software engineering require multi-turn interactions with feedback.

Method: A modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm is used to train a Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct agent for software engineering tasks.

Result: The agent's success rate on SWE-bench increased from 20% to 39%, matching or outperforming leading models like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

Conclusion: The approach offers a viable path for building autonomous agents for complex real-world problems using open models.

Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language
Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as
mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can
be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate
case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This
contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),
which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that
responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this
general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)
algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world
software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to
39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches
or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward
building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based
on open models.

TL;DR: MoKA introduces a mixture of Kronecker adapters for PEFT, improving expressiveness and parameter efficiency in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited expressiveness of low-rank adapters in PEFT for LLMs.

Method: Proposes Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA) with a gating mechanism for flexible rank adaptation and hardware-efficient computations.

Result: Outperforms PEFT baselines, reduces trainable parameters by up to 27x, and achieves better performance-parameter trade-offs.

Conclusion: MoKA offers a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs with superior performance and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the
computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family
adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while
maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness
due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks.
We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker
adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture
of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that
measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive
adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better
trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware
efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix
operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct
extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks
using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not
only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable
parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance
and parameter efficiency.

*Deepak Pandita,Flip Korn,Chris Welty,Christopher M. Homan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the trade-off between the number of items (N) and annotations per item (K) for reliable ML evaluation, finding that accounting for human disagreement is feasible with N × K ≤ 1000, often requiring K > 10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility in ML evaluations is crucial but often ignores human disagreement due to budget constraints. This study aims to optimize the (N, K) configuration for reliable evaluation.

Method: Analyzed categorical datasets with multiple annotations and simulated distributions to determine optimal (N, K) under fixed budgets, focusing on evaluation metrics.

Result: Human disagreement can be reliably accounted for with N × K ≤ 1000, often requiring K > 10. The trade-off between K and N depends on the metric's sensitivity to response distributions.

Conclusion: The findings guide ML practitioners in optimizing test data collection for reliability within budget constraints, emphasizing the importance of metric choice and annotation strategy.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the
authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning
evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground
truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,
among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has
studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as
is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for
collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more
samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the
per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of
items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable
machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical
datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated
distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$
configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation
data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our
findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N
\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested
on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always
occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and
$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics
that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better
at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get
more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and
annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern CNNs have limitations like data inefficiency and poor generalization. The primate visual system's superior performance suggests its architecture could improve artificial vision systems.

Method: VCNet mimics primate visual cortex mechanisms: hierarchical processing, dual-stream segregation, and top-down feedback. It's tested on Spots-10 and light field datasets.

Result: VCNet achieves 92.1% accuracy on Spots-10 and 74.4% on light field tasks, outperforming comparable models.

Conclusion: Incorporating neuroscientific principles into network design enhances efficiency and robustness, addressing key machine learning challenges.

Abstract: Despite their success in image classification, modern convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency,
poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior
efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural principles may
offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision systems. This paper
introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture
whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual
cortex. VCNet emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical
processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation,
and top-down predictive feedback. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized
benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset and a light field image
classification task. Our results show that VCNet achieves a classification
accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset,
surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that
integrating neuroscientific principles into network design can lead to more
efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing
long-standing challenges in machine learning.

Conclusion: Combining financial and textual data enhances credit rating effectiveness and reliability.

Abstract: Corporate credit rating serves as a crucial intermediary service in the

credit rating models rely on financial metrics and deep learning. However, they
often overlook insights from non-financial data, such as corporate annual

TL;DR: The paper addresses misalignment between user intents and LLM-generated code by proposing direct intent-task matching, implemented in NeuroSync, which improves alignment and coding efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational LLMs often misalign with user intents due to bidirectional ambiguity, causing frustration.

Method: Proposes direct intent-task matching, implemented in NeuroSync, which uses knowledge distillation and visualizations for user inspection and editing.

Result: NeuroSync enhances alignment, reduces cognitive effort, and improves coding efficiency, validated by a user study (N=12).

Conclusion: Direct intent-task matching via NeuroSync effectively addresses misalignment, improving user experience and coding outcomes.

Abstract: Conversational LLMs have been widely adopted by domain users with limited
programming experience to solve domain problems. However, these users often
face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in
frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause
of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents
and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and
interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we
propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that
externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e.,
the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code
generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in
NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM
understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by
allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We
evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and
assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The
results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort,
and improves coding efficiency.

*Haotian Wang,Yuzhe Weng,Jun Du,Haoran Xu,Xiaoyan Wu,Shan He,Bing Yin,Cong Liu,Jianqing Gao,Qingfeng Liu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: READ is a real-time diffusion-transformer framework for talking head generation, addressing slow inference speeds via compressed latent spaces and an asynchronous noise scheduler.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for talking head generation are slow, limiting practical use. READ aims to enable real-time performance.

Method: Uses a temporal VAE for compressed video latent space, SpeechAE for audio alignment, and A2V-DiT for synthesis. Introduces ANS for consistency and speed.

Result: READ generates high-quality videos faster than state-of-the-art methods, maintaining stability in long sequences.

Conclusion: READ achieves real-time talking head generation with balanced quality and speed, advancing practical applications.

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

### [196] [Evaluation of 3D Counterfactual Brain MRI Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02880)
*Pengwei Sun,Wei Peng,Lun Yu Li,Yixin Wang,Kilian M. Pohl*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores counterfactual generation for 3D brain MRIs using six generative models with anatomy-guided conditioning, evaluating their performance on ADNI and NCANDA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating realistic 3D brain MRIs that respect anatomical and causal constraints, and to improve interpretability and clinical relevance.

Method: Six generative models are adapted into 3D counterfactual approaches using an anatomy-guided framework with regional brain volumes as conditioning inputs. Evaluation includes composition, reversibility, realism, effectiveness, and minimality.

Result: Anatomically grounded conditioning modifies targeted regions but struggles with preserving non-targeted structures. The benchmark reveals limitations in capturing anatomical interdependencies.

Conclusion: The work sets a foundation for interpretable generative modeling of brain MRIs but calls for new architectures to better handle anatomical interdependencies.

Abstract: Counterfactual generation offers a principled framework for simulating
hypothetical changes in medical imaging, with potential applications in
understanding disease mechanisms and generating physiologically plausible data.
However, generating realistic structural 3D brain MRIs that respect anatomical
and causal constraints remains challenging due to data scarcity, structural
complexity, and the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. In this work, we
convert six generative models into 3D counterfactual approaches by
incorporating an anatomy-guided framework based on a causal graph, in which
regional brain volumes serve as direct conditioning inputs. Each model is
evaluated with respect to composition, reversibility, realism, effectiveness
and minimality on T1-weighted brain MRIs (T1w MRIs) from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In addition, we test the
generalizability of each model with respect to T1w MRIs of the National
Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Our results
indicate that anatomically grounded conditioning successfully modifies the
targeted anatomical regions; however, it exhibits limitations in preserving
non-targeted structures. Beyond laying the groundwork for more interpretable
and clinically relevant generative modeling of brain MRIs, this benchmark
highlights the need for novel architectures that more accurately capture
anatomical interdependencies.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: REFLECT introduces a novel framework using rectified flows for unsupervised anomaly detection in brain imaging, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with single-step inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate anomaly localization in brain imaging is challenging due to complex anatomy and lack of labeled abnormal data.

Method: REFLECT leverages rectified flows to create a linear, one-step correction map for abnormal MR images, enabling efficient anomaly correction and localization.

Result: Extensive experiments show REFLECT significantly outperforms existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods.

Conclusion: REFLECT provides an efficient, accurate solution for unsupervised anomaly detection in brain imaging, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) in brain imaging is crucial for
identifying pathologies without the need for labeled data. However, accurately
localizing anomalies remains challenging due to the intricate structure of
brain anatomy and the scarcity of abnormal examples. In this work, we introduce
REFLECT, a novel framework that leverages rectified flows to establish a
direct, linear trajectory for correcting abnormal MR images toward a normal
distribution. By learning a straight, one-step correction transport map, our
method efficiently corrects brain anomalies and can precisely localize
anomalies by detecting discrepancies between anomalous input and corrected
counterpart. In contrast to the diffusion-based UAD models, which require
iterative stochastic sampling, rectified flows provide a direct transport map,
enabling single-step inference. Extensive experiments on popular UAD brain
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that REFLECT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods. The code is available
at https://github.com/farzad-bz/REFLECT.

*Puzhen Wu,Mingquan Lin,Qingyu Chen,Emily Y. Chew,Zhiyong Lu,Yifan Peng,Hexin Dong*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AMD-Mamba is a multi-modal framework for AMD prognosis, integrating fundus images, genetic data, and socio-demographics. It uses metric learning and Vision Mamba for improved feature representation and outperforms traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AMD causes irreversible vision loss, necessitating early and accurate prognosis for timely intervention.

Method: Combines color fundus images, genetic variants, and socio-demographics with a metric learning strategy and Vision Mamba for local and global feature fusion.

Result: Outperforms conventional methods, identifying a significant biomarker for AMD progression and improving early detection of high-risk patients.

Conclusion: AMD-Mamba enhances precision in AMD management, offering proactive and multi-modal prognosis.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible
vision loss, making effective prognosis crucial for timely intervention. In
this work, we propose AMD-Mamba, a novel multi-modal framework for AMD
prognosis, and further develop a new AMD biomarker. This framework integrates
color fundus images with genetic variants and socio-demographic variables. At
its core, AMD-Mamba introduces an innovative metric learning strategy that
leverages AMD severity scale score as prior knowledge. This strategy allows the
model to learn richer feature representations by aligning learned features with
clinical phenotypes, thereby improving the capability of conventional prognosis
methods in capturing disease progression patterns. In addition, unlike existing
models that use traditional CNN backbones and focus primarily on local
information, such as the presence of drusen, AMD-Mamba applies Vision Mamba and
simultaneously fuses local and long-range global information, such as vascular
changes. Furthermore, we enhance prediction performance through multi-scale
fusion, combining image information with clinical variables at different
resolutions. We evaluate AMD-Mamba on the AREDS dataset, which includes 45,818
color fundus photographs, 52 genetic variants, and 3 socio-demographic
variables from 2,741 subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed biomarker is one of the most significant biomarkers for the
progression of AMD. Notably, combining this biomarker with other existing
variables yields promising improvements in detecting high-risk AMD patients at
early stages. These findings highlight the potential of our multi-modal
framework to facilitate more precise and proactive management of AMD.

TL;DR: ClinicalFMamba, a CNN-Mamba hybrid, enhances multimodal medical image fusion by combining local and global features efficiently, validated on 2D/3D datasets and clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (CNNs, Transformers) have limitations in global context modeling or computational efficiency, hindering clinical deployment.

Method: Proposes ClinicalFMamba, an end-to-end CNN-Mamba hybrid with a tri-plane scanning strategy for 3D volumetric data.

Result: Superior fusion performance on multiple metrics and real-time capability, validated on brain tumor classification tasks.

Conclusion: ClinicalFMamba offers an efficient, clinically viable solution for multimodal medical image fusion.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion integrates complementary information from
different imaging modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment
planning. While deep learning methods have advanced performance, existing
approaches face critical limitations: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
excel at local feature extraction but struggle to model global context
effectively, while Transformers achieve superior long-range modeling at the
cost of quadratic computational complexity, limiting clinical deployment.
Recent State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling
efficient long-range dependency modeling in linear time through selective scan
mechanisms. Despite these advances, the extension to 3D volumetric data and the
clinical validation of fused images remains underexplored. In this work, we
propose ClinicalFMamba, a novel end-to-end CNN-Mamba hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines local and global feature modeling for 2D and 3D
images. We further design a tri-plane scanning strategy for effectively
learning volumetric dependencies in 3D images. Comprehensive evaluations on
three datasets demonstrate the superior fusion performance across multiple
quantitative metrics while achieving real-time fusion. We further validate the
clinical utility of our approach on downstream 2D/3D brain tumor classification
tasks, achieving superior performance over baseline methods. Our method
establishes a new paradigm for efficient multimodal medical image fusion
suitable for real-time clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds offer a compact, surface-preserving alternative for 3D medical imaging, but challenges like data scarcity and interpretability persist.

Result: Highlights trends (hybrid representations, self-supervised models) and challenges (data scarcity, variability).

Conclusion: Future directions include advancing point cloud-based shape learning for clinical applications.

Abstract: Point clouds have become an increasingly important representation for 3D
medical imaging, offering a compact, surface-preserving alternative to
traditional voxel or mesh-based approaches. Recent advances in deep learning
have enabled rapid progress in extracting, modeling, and analyzing anatomical
shapes directly from point cloud data. This paper provides a comprehensive and
systematic survey of learning-based shape analysis for medical point clouds,
focusing on three fundamental tasks: registration, reconstruction, and
variation modeling. We review recent literature from 2021 to 2025, summarize
representative methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, and highlight
clinical applications and unique challenges in the medical domain. Key trends
include the integration of hybrid representations, large-scale self-supervised
models, and generative techniques. We also discuss current limitations, such as

robust solutions for clinical deployment. Finally, future directions are
outlined for advancing point cloud-based shape learning in medical imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Nexus-INR is a novel framework for arbitrary-resolution super-resolution (ARSR) in medical images, combining diverse knowledge and downstream tasks to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN-based methods are limited to fixed upsampling factors, and INR-based methods struggle with multi-modal images. Nexus-INR addresses these gaps by leveraging diverse knowledge and tasks.

Method: Nexus-INR includes a dual-branch encoder, a knowledge distillation module with cross-modal attention, and an integrated segmentation module to enhance reconstruction and segmentation.

Result: Experiments on BraTS2020 show Nexus-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in super-resolution and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Nexus-INR effectively adapts to diverse resolutions and modalities, improving both image reconstruction and downstream performance.

Abstract: Arbitrary-resolution super-resolution (ARSR) provides crucial flexibility for
medical image analysis by adapting to diverse spatial resolutions. However,
traditional CNN-based methods are inherently ill-suited for ARSR, as they are
typically designed for fixed upsampling factors. While INR-based methods
overcome this limitation, they still struggle to effectively process and
leverage multi-modal images with varying resolutions and details. In this
paper, we propose Nexus-INR, a Diverse Knowledge-guided ARSR framework, which
employs varied information and downstream tasks to achieve high-quality,
adaptive-resolution medical image super-resolution. Specifically, Nexus-INR
contains three key components. A dual-branch encoder with an auxiliary
classification task to effectively disentangle shared anatomical structures and
modality-specific features; a knowledge distillation module using cross-modal
attention that guides low-resolution modality reconstruction with
high-resolution reference, enhanced by self-supervised consistency loss; an
integrated segmentation module that embeds anatomical semantics to improve both
reconstruction quality and downstream segmentation performance. Experiments on
the BraTS2020 dataset for both super-resolution and downstream segmentation
demonstrate that Nexus-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various
metrics.

*Yifei Sun,Zhanghao Chen,Hao Zheng,Yuqing Lu,Lixin Duan,Fenglei Fan,Ahmed Elazab,Xiang Wan,Changmiao Wang,Ruiquan Ge*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GL-LCM, a deep learning model for fast and high-resolution bone suppression in CXR images, addressing limitations of existing methods like computational inefficiency and loss of texture details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bone structures in CXR images obscure critical details, hindering accurate diagnosis. Existing diffusion-based methods fail to balance bone suppression with texture preservation and are computationally demanding.

Method: Proposes GL-LCM, combining lung segmentation, dual-path sampling, and global-local fusion, with Local-Enhanced Guidance to mitigate boundary artifacts and blurring.

Result: GL-LCM outperforms existing methods in bone suppression and computational efficiency on datasets SZCH-X-Rays and JSRT.

Conclusion: GL-LCM offers a practical solution for improving CXR image clarity and diagnostic accuracy, with superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Chest X-Ray (CXR) imaging for pulmonary diagnosis raises significant
challenges, primarily because bone structures can obscure critical details
necessary for accurate diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning,
particularly with diffusion models, offer significant promise for effectively
minimizing the visibility of bone structures in CXR images, thereby improving
clarity and diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, existing diffusion-based methods
for bone suppression in CXR imaging struggle to balance the complete
suppression of bones with preserving local texture details. Additionally, their
high computational demand and extended processing time hinder their practical
use in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we introduce a
Global-Local Latent Consistency Model (GL-LCM) architecture. This model
combines lung segmentation, dual-path sampling, and global-local fusion,
enabling fast high-resolution bone suppression in CXR images. To tackle
potential boundary artifacts and detail blurring in local-path sampling, we
further propose Local-Enhanced Guidance, which addresses these issues without
additional training. Comprehensive experiments on a self-collected dataset
SZCH-X-Rays, and the public dataset JSRT, reveal that our GL-LCM delivers
superior bone suppression and remarkable computational efficiency,
significantly outperforming several competitive methods. Our code is available

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MRI-based models for predicting post-prostatectomy ED slightly outperformed handcrafted anatomical methods but did not surpass clinical-only models. Fusion models showed marginal improvement. Clinical features remained the strongest predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if preoperative MRI adds predictive value for ED post-radical prostatectomy, beyond established clinical predictors.

Method: Four modeling strategies were tested: clinical-only baseline, classical models with handcrafted MRI features, deep learning on MRI slices, and multimodal fusion of imaging and clinical inputs.

Result: MRI-based models (AUC 0.569) slightly outperformed handcrafted methods (AUC 0.554) but underperformed clinical-only models (AUC 0.663). Fusion models showed minor gains (AUC 0.586). Clinical features were most influential.

Conclusion: MRI did not outperform clinical predictors but may complement them in future multimodal approaches, as it focuses on relevant anatomical regions.

Abstract: Accurate preoperative prediction of erectile dysfunction (ED) is important
for counseling patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. While clinical
features are established predictors, the added value of preoperative MRI
remains underexplored. We investigate whether MRI provides additional
predictive value for ED at 12 months post-surgery, evaluating four modeling
strategies: (1) a clinical-only baseline, representing current
state-of-the-art; (2) classical models using handcrafted anatomical features
derived from MRI; (3) deep learning models trained directly on MRI slices; and
(4) multimodal fusion of imaging and clinical inputs. Imaging-based models
(maximum AUC 0.569) slightly outperformed handcrafted anatomical approaches
(AUC 0.554) but fell short of the clinical baseline (AUC 0.663). Fusion models
offered marginal gains (AUC 0.586) but did not exceed clinical-only
performance. SHAP analysis confirmed that clinical features contributed most to
predictive performance. Saliency maps from the best-performing imaging model
suggested a predominant focus on anatomically plausible regions, such as the
prostate and neurovascular bundles. While MRI-based models did not improve
predictive performance over clinical features, our findings suggest that they
try to capture patterns in relevant anatomical structures and may complement
clinical predictors in future multimodal approaches.

TL;DR: CADD introduces a conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D brain images, improving anomaly detection by integrating clinical context and enhancing image restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting pathology in heterogeneous medical datasets is challenging; existing methods lack clinical context and struggle with healthy region restoration.

Method: CADD uses a conditional diffusion model with a novel inference inpainting strategy to balance anomaly removal and feature retention.

Result: CADD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities across diverse clinical datasets.

Conclusion: CADD advances normative modeling by combining diffusion models with clinical guidance, improving anomaly detection in real-world medical data.

Abstract: Applying machine learning to real-world medical data, e.g. from hospital
archives, has the potential to revolutionize disease detection in brain images.
However, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult
challenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers
a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is
modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to
disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly
detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and
generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration;
differences between the original and restored images highlight potential
abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model
approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important
context to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard
approaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor
reconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the
first conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide
the healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting
strategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific
features. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans,
which may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities
in heterogeneous cohorts.

Motivation: Addressing the escalating costs of LLM-driven agents to ensure scalability and accessibility without compromising performance.

Method: Empirical analysis on the GAIA benchmark, evaluating LLM backbone selection, agent framework designs, and test-time scaling strategies using the cost-of-pass metric.

Result: Efficient Agents achieves 96.7% performance of OWL while reducing costs by 28.4%.

Conclusion: The study offers insights for designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, enhancing AI accessibility and sustainability.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility

significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and

*Zikun Cui,Tianyi Huang,Chia-En Chiang,Cuiqianhe Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel LLM-based agent for misinformation detection verifies claims dynamically, assesses source credibility, and provides transparent reasoning, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLMs and misinformation necessitates advanced, verifiable detection methods beyond binary judgments.

Method: The agent uses three tools (web search, source credibility assessment, numerical claim verification) for multi-step verification and evidence synthesis.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, reasoning transparency, and robustness to rewritten content.

Conclusion: Introduces a trustworthy AI paradigm for fact-checking with enhanced transparency and reliability.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of
misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research
proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses
information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete
verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three
core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

### [210] [A Comparative Study of Neurosymbolic AI Approaches to Interpretable Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03366)
*Michael K. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares integrative and hybrid neurosymbolic approaches for general logical reasoning in LLMs, favoring the hybrid approach for interpretability and leveraging LLM strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack deterministic reasoning and interpretability, prompting interest in neurosymbolic AI to enhance logical reasoning.

Method: Two approaches are analyzed: integrative (Logic Neural Network) and hybrid (LLM-Symbolic Solver). Their performance on domain-agnostic tasks is compared.

Result: The hybrid approach (LLM-SS) is more promising due to interpretable reasoning chains and retaining LLM advantages.

Conclusion: A modular, domain-agnostic framework based on the hybrid approach is proposed for future work.

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

### [211] [T2UE: Generating Unlearnable Examples from Text Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03091)
*Xingjun Ma,Hanxun Huang,Tianwei Song,Ye Sun,Yifeng Gao,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T2UE introduces a text-based framework for generating unlearnable examples (UEs) to protect data without exposing original images, resolving privacy concerns in multimodal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy paradox in current UE methods, which require exposing data to third-party services for protection, by enabling UE generation from text alone.

Method: Leverages a text-to-image model to map text descriptions into image noise space and an error-minimization framework to create effective unlearnable noise.

Result: T2UE significantly degrades downstream task performance for state-of-the-art models and generalizes across architectures and learning settings.

Conclusion: T2UE enables zero-contact data protection, safeguarding personal data without direct exposure, offering a scalable privacy solution.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

*Haoran Lin,Wenrui Chen,Xianchi Chen,Fan Yang,Qiang Diao,Wenxin Xie,Sijie Wu,Kailun Yang,Maojun Li,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UniFucGrasp introduces a universal functional grasp annotation strategy and dataset for diverse dexterous hands, improving manipulation accuracy and grasp stability while reducing annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current grasp datasets focus on stability but lack functional grasps for tasks like opening bottles or holding cups. Existing methods rely on expensive, hard-to-control high-DOF hands.

Method: The approach maps human motions to robotic hands using biomimicry and geometry-based force closure for functional, stable grasps. It supports low-cost, efficient data collection.

Result: Experiments show improved functional manipulation accuracy, grasp stability, and generalization across robotic hands.

Conclusion: UniFucGrasp addresses annotation cost and generalization challenges, offering a scalable solution for functional grasping.

Abstract: Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly
emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like
opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and
hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's
underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp
annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on
biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses
geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps.
This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality
functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp
dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness.
Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that
our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability,
enables efficient generalization across diverse robotic hands, and overcomes
annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping. The

*Akshay L Chandra,Iman Nematollahi,Chenguang Huang,Tim Welschehold,Wolfram Burgard,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DiWA introduces an offline framework for fine-tuning diffusion policies with RL, using a world model to improve sample efficiency and reduce real-world interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with RL is inefficient due to long denoising sequences and high interaction requirements.

Method: DiWA leverages a world model trained on offline interactions to fine-tune diffusion policies without real-world interactions.

Result: DiWA improves performance on the CALVIN benchmark with significantly fewer interactions than model-free baselines.

Conclusion: DiWA successfully demonstrates offline fine-tuning of diffusion policies for robotic skills, enhancing practicality and safety.

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents
significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction
impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require
millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical
fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion
policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong
dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for
fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement
learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment
interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective
adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline
play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,
making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot
learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across
eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude
fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world
robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly
available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

### [214] [BadBlocks: Low-Cost and Stealthy Backdoor Attacks Tailored for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03221)
*Yu Pan,Jiahao Chen,Lin Wang,Bingrong Dai,Yi Du*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces BadBlocks, a lightweight and covert backdoor attack method for diffusion models, requiring fewer resources and evading advanced defenses while maintaining high attack success and low quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the susceptibility of diffusion models to backdoor attacks and highlight the limitations of current defense mechanisms against more covert threats.

Method: BadBlocks selectively contaminates specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models, avoiding full network fine-tuning and leveraging key neural network layers for backdoor mapping.

Result: BadBlocks achieves high attack success rates and low perceptual quality loss, even with minimal computational resources, and bypasses existing defense frameworks.

Conclusion: BadBlocks lowers the barrier for backdoor attacks, enabling them on large-scale diffusion models with consumer-grade GPUs, posing a novel and significant threat.

Abstract: In recent years,Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the
field of image generation.However,recent studies have shown that diffusion
models are susceptible to backdoor attacks,in which attackers can manipulate
the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or
textual phrases into the training dataset.Fortunately,with the continuous
advancement of defense techniques,defenders have become increasingly capable of
identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and
neural network-based detection methods.However,in this paper,we identify a
novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing
approaches,which we name BadBlocks,requires only about 30\% of the
computational resources and 20\% GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor
attacks,yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced
defense frameworks.BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate
specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while
maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components.Experimental
results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate (ASR)
and low perceptual quality loss (as measured by FID Score),even under extremely
constrained computational resources and GPU time.Moreover,BadBlocks is able to
bypass existing defense frameworks,especially the attention-based backdoor
detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat.Ablation
studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require
fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural
network layers in backdoor mapping.Overall,BadBlocks significantly reduces the
barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects.It enables attackers to
inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade
GPUs.

Result: Found negative sentiment linked to war events, nuanced partisanship (pro-Ukrainian/Russian), and strategic misinformation. Community detection revealed distinct clusters.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of digital warfare and misinformation dynamics, offering insights into OSINT's role in geopolitical conflicts.

Abstract: This paper examines the role of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) on Twitter
regarding the Russo-Ukrainian war, distinguishing between genuine OSINT and
deceptive misinformation efforts, termed "BULLSHINT." Utilizing a dataset
spanning from January 2022 to July 2023, we analyze nearly 2 million tweets
from approximately 1,040 users involved in discussing real-time military
engagements, strategic analyses, and misinformation related to the conflict.
Using sentiment analysis, partisanship detection, misinformation
identification, and Named Entity Recognition (NER), we uncover communicative
patterns and dissemination strategies within the OSINT community. Significant
findings reveal a predominant negative sentiment influenced by war events, a
nuanced distribution of pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian partisanship, and the
potential strategic manipulation of information. Additionally, we apply
community detection techniques, which are able to identify distinct clusters
partisanship, topics, and misinformation, highlighting the complex dynamics of
information spread on social media. This research contributes to the
understanding of digital warfare and misinformation dynamics, offering insights
into the operationalization of OSINT in geopolitical conflicts.

### [216] [Investigation on deep learning-based galaxy image translation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03291)
*Hengxin Ruan,Qiufan Lin,Shupei Chen,Yang Wang,Wei Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness of deep learning models in preserving high-order physical information (like spectroscopic redshift) in galaxy image translation, finding limitations despite success in pixel and morphology-level reproduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on preserving complex high-order physical information in galaxy image translation, which is crucial for high-fidelity studies.

Method: Tested four models (Swin Transformer, SRGAN, capsule network, diffusion model) on SDSS and CFHTLS galaxy images to evaluate redshift preservation alongside pixel and morphology-level data.

Result: Models struggled to retain redshift information, with cross-band peak fluxes being informative but uncertain due to many-to-many mapping. Imperfect translations still hold value for less demanding applications.

Conclusion: The study highlights challenges in preserving high-order physical information in image translation but suggests potential for downstream applications, guiding future model development for scientific use.

Abstract: Galaxy image translation is an important application in galaxy physics and
cosmology. With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has
been performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information
extraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly
detection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the
pixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack
of discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical
information, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely
on high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the
effectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical
information (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and
morphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin
Transformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS
and CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of
incapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures
of galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In
particular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain
meaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable
uncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to
the nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images
may still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise
for downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly
required. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical
information is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the
development of image translation models for scientific use.
