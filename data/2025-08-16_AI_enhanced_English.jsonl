Three\nsenior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the\nSTAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern\nattention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze\nand diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.\nSpecifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn\nSTAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.\nTransformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation\nmodules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,\nsuppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global\nrepresentations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents\nfeature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic\naccuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive\ndiagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,\n0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces STAMP, a deep learning framework for diagnosing Spread through Air Spaces (STAS) in lung adenocarcinoma, achieving high accuracy across multi-center datasets.", "motivation": "STAS in lung adenocarcinoma is linked to poor outcomes, but diagnosis is challenging due to its complex pathology.

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce \\textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the\ncross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four\ndiverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,\nand animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application\nscenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,\nspanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and\ncounting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support\nfine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,\nwhether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to\ndomains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.\nFurthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \\eg, fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and\nour accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing\ndomain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding.

It is a\nbiennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to\nbuild models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli.\nPrevious editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos;\nthe 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field\nfurther by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting\nfMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the\ndataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie\nstimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours\nof training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature\nfilms (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall\nStreet). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for\nin-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who\ncould best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out\nout-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team\nreports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed\n4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they\nreveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next.", "AI": {"tldr": "The Algonauts 2025 Challenge involved predicting human brain activity from long, multimodal movies, with winners determined by out-of-distribution performance.", "motivation": "To advance computational neuroscience by developing models that predict brain activity from complex, naturalistic stimuli.", "method": "Teams built models to predict fMRI responses across 1,000 brain parcels using 80 hours of movie stimuli, including training and validation sets.", "result": "The top team's model best predicted brain activity for held-out films, with the MedARC team placing 4th.", "conclusion": "The challenge highlights progress in brain encoding and suggests future directions for modeling naturalistic stimuli."}}
