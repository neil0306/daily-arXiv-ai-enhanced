We show\nthat policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common\noccurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This\ntheoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly\ndisparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards\nthat may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action\ndegeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting\nto the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how\nstability is governed by an \"effective reward\" aggregation mechanism. We also\nprove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of\nincreased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for\nrecent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following\ntrade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through\nperturbation experiments in multi-reward RL.

This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic\nframework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches\nthat rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require\nmodel-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates\ndirectly within the feature space without retraining or architectural\nmodifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender\nbias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the\nsparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased\ndirection per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed\nduring inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.\nTrained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing\ndirection, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased\nsubspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable\nDiffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially\nreduces gender bias while preserving generation quality.

In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results\nshow that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves\ncompetitive performance gains with favorable efficiency.
