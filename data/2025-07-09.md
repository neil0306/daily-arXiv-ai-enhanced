### [1] [TokenShapley: Token Level Context Attribution with Shapley Value](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05261)
*Yingtai Xiao,Yuqing Zhu,Sirat Samyoun,Wanrong Zhang,Jiachen T. Wang,Jian Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokenShapley improves token-level attribution in LLMs by combining Shapley values and KNN retrieval, outperforming baselines by 11-23%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sentence-level attribution methods fail for specific keywords in LLM responses, necessitating a finer-grained approach.

Method: TokenShapley integrates Shapley value-based attribution with KNN retrieval, using a precomputed datastore for contextual retrieval.

Result: TokenShapley achieves 11-23% higher accuracy in token-level attribution across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: TokenShapley offers a superior fine-grained attribution method for LLM responses, addressing limitations of prior work.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in in-context
learning, but verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a
challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these
methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the
response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we
propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines
Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques
inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed
datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify
token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution
approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an
11-23% improvement in accuracy.

### [2] [User Behavior Prediction as a Generic, Robust, Scalable, and Low-Cost Evaluation Strategy for Estimating Generalization in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05266)
*Sougata Saha,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes user behavior prediction as a better measure for LLM generalization, testing it on recommendation tasks with GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data contamination makes traditional generalization measures like knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks unreliable for LLMs.

Method: A novel framework for user behavior prediction is introduced and tested on movie and music recommendation datasets.

Result: GPT-4o outperforms GPT-4o-mini and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, but all models show room for improvement.

Conclusion: User behavior prediction is a scalable and robust alternative for measuring LLM generalization.

Abstract: Measuring the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
challenging due to data contamination. As models grow and computation becomes
cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will
become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks
are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for
specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect
of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative.
We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music
recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
Results align with our framework's predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms
GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement,
especially Llama.

### [3] [An Adaptive Supervised Contrastive Learning Framework for Implicit Sexism Detection in Digital Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05271)
*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Aditya Shah,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASCEND introduces adaptive contrastive learning for implicit sexism detection, improving accuracy by refining embeddings and combining multiple features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook implicit sexism in social media, necessitating a more nuanced detection approach.

Method: Uses threshold-based contrastive learning, joint optimization of contrastive and cross-entropy losses, and enhanced textual features with attention and auxiliary features.

Result: Outperforms existing methods with significant F1 improvements (9.86% to 32.51%) on EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets.

Conclusion: ASCEND effectively detects implicit sexism by leveraging adaptive learning and multi-feature integration.

Abstract: The global reach of social media has amplified the spread of hateful content,
including implicit sexism, which is often overlooked by conventional detection
methods. In this work, we introduce an Adaptive Supervised Contrastive lEarning
framework for implicit sexism detectioN (ASCEND). A key innovation of our
method is the incorporation of threshold-based contrastive learning: by
computing cosine similarities between embeddings, we selectively treat only
those sample pairs as positive if their similarity exceeds a learnable
threshold. This mechanism refines the embedding space by robustly pulling
together representations of semantically similar texts while pushing apart
dissimilar ones, thus reducing false positives and negatives. The final
classification is achieved by jointly optimizing a contrastive loss with a
cross-entropy loss. Textual features are enhanced through a word-level
attention module. Additionally, we employ sentiment, emotion, and toxicity
features. Evaluations on the EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets demonstrate that
ASCEND significantly outperforms existing methods, with average Macro F1
improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% across multiple tasks, highlighting
its efficacy in capturing the subtle cues of implicit sexist language.

### [4] [Beyond classical and contemporary models: a transformative ai framework for student dropout prediction in distance learning using rag, prompt engineering, and cross-modal fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05285)
*Miloud Mihoubi,Meriem Zerkouk,Belkacem Chikhaoui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI framework for dropout prediction in distance learning, combining sentiment analysis, prompt engineering, and cross-modal attention fusion to improve accuracy and reduce false negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the societal and economic impact of student dropout by capturing nuanced emotional and contextual factors often missed by traditional models.

Method: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for sentiment analysis, prompt engineering to identify academic stressors, and cross-modal attention fusion to integrate textual, behavioral, and socio-demographic data.

Result: Achieves 89% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false negatives by 21%.

Conclusion: The framework bridges predictive analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering scalable solutions to mitigate dropout risks globally.

Abstract: Student dropout in distance learning remains a critical challenge, with
profound societal and economic consequences. While classical machine learning
models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often
fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in
unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI
framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic
innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment
analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors, and cross-modal
attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and
socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated
knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets
student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized
prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload
anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with
temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk profiles. Evaluated on a
longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and
an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false
negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable
interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship
programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive
analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate
dropout risks in global education systems

### [5] [LCDS: A Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary Generation System Supporting Source Attribution and Expert Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05319)
*Cheng Yuan,Xinkai Rui,Yongqi Fan,Yawei Fan,Boyang Zhong,Jiacheng Wang,Weiyan Zhang,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LCDS is a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary system designed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs by mapping EMRs to summaries and using logical rules for reliable, attributed outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLM hallucination and source attribution challenges in generating discharge summaries from long-form EMRs.

Method: Constructs a source mapping table via textual similarity and applies logical rules to generate reliable summaries with source attribution.

Result: Produces silver summaries for clinical fields, supports expert review, and enables incremental LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LCDS improves reliability and traceability in discharge summary generation, with potential for LLM refinement.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automated discharge summary generation, they still suffer from hallucination
issues, such as generating inaccurate content or fabricating information
without valid sources. In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically
consist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the
generated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS,
a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a
source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and
discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover,
LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate
more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields.
Furthermore, LCDS supports source attribution for generated content, allowing
experts to efficiently review, provide feedback, and rectify errors. The
resulting golden discharge summaries are subsequently recorded for incremental
fine-tuning of LLMs. Our project and demo video are in the GitHub repository
https://github.com/ycycyc02/LCDS.

### [7] [LoRA-Augmented Generation (LAG) for Knowledge-Intensive Language Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05346)
*William Fleshman,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAG (LoRA-Augmented Generation) is a method for efficiently selecting and combining task-specific LoRA adapters without additional training or data, outperforming existing data-free methods and integrating with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient methods to leverage large libraries of task-specific LoRA adapters for language models.

Method: LAG filters, retrieves, and applies LoRA adapters per-token and per-layer without training or data access.

Result: Superior performance on knowledge-intensive tasks compared to data-free methods; compatible with RAG when additional data is available.

Conclusion: LAG is an effective, flexible solution for leveraging task-specific adapters, with potential for integration with other augmentation methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of fine-tuned language model experts for specific tasks and
domains signals the need for efficient selection and combination methods. We
propose LoRA-Augmented Generation (LAG) for leveraging large libraries of
knowledge and task-specific LoRA adapters. LAG requires no additional training
or access to data, and efficiently filters, retrieves, and applies experts on a
per-token and layer basis. We evaluate LAG on various knowledge-intensive
tasks, achieving superior performance over existing data-free methods. We
explore scenarios where additional data is available, demonstrating LAG's
compatibility with alternative solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG).

### [8] [On the Bias of Next-Token Predictors Toward Systematically Inefficient Reasoning: A Shortest-Path Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05362)
*Riccardo Alberghi,Elizaveta Demyanenko,Luca Biggio,Luca Saglietti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs generalize better with inefficient but coherent reasoning traces, not just longer ones, due to easier optimization of training signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how reasoning trace structure and compute allocation affect LLM performance, focusing on systematic and incremental reasoning.

Method: Controlled experiments using shortest-path tasks in layered graphs, training models on optimal vs. inefficient traces with a custom tokenizer.

Result: Models trained on inefficient traces generalize better, linked to higher confidence in next-token prediction, not trace length alone.

Conclusion: Long, coherent, and locally incremental reasoning traces improve generalization by making training signals easier to optimize.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for
improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more
test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces
redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when
reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought
(CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we
introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs.
We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a
custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic
programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving
backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained
on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not
due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails
to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization
correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting
that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal
easier to optimize.

### [9] [EduCoder: An Open-Source Annotation System for Education Transcript Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05385)
*Guanzhong Pan,Mei Tan,Hyunji Nam,Lucía Langlois,James Malamut,Liliana Deonizio,Dorottya Demszky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EduCoder is a specialized tool for annotating educational dialogue, addressing challenges like complex codebooks and contextual features, with features for collaborative coding and annotation comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing general-purpose annotation tools lack support for the complexities of educational dialogue, such as diverse interactions and pedagogical features.

Method: EduCoder provides a platform for defining complex codebooks, supports categorical and open-ended annotations, and includes contextual materials and annotator comparison.

Result: The tool facilitates reliable annotation of educational dialogue by enabling collaborative coding and calibration among annotators.

Conclusion: EduCoder fills a gap in educational dialogue annotation, offering an open-source solution with practical features for researchers and domain experts.

Abstract: We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support
utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text
annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the
complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse
teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining
codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and
categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such
as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder
is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers
and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on
observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types
along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side
comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and
calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability. The system
is open-source, with a demo video available.

### [10] [The Generalization Ridge: Information Flow in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05387)
*Ruidi Chang,Chunyuan Deng,Hanjie Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to study how predictive information flows across transformer layers, revealing a non-monotonic trend where generalization peaks in upper-middle layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer models generalize and memorize information across layers, as prior work lacks clarity on this mechanism.

Method: Proposes InfoRidge to measure mutual information between hidden representations and target outputs, and introduces residual scaling coefficients to probe layer importance.

Result: Predictive information peaks in upper-middle layers (generalization ridge) and declines in final layers, with ridge layers being crucial under distribution shift.

Conclusion: Intermediate layers play a critical role in generalization, offering new insights into transformer mechanisms.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in natural language generation (NLG) tasks, yet their internal mechanisms for
synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While
prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable
representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and
propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,
we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how
predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations
and target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to
trace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during
training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a
consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle
layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,
reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further
investigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling
coefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which
serve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual
transformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,
models downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,
highlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new
insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the
critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.

### [11] [Controlling What You Share: Assessing Language Model Adherence to Privacy Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05391)
*Guillem Ramírez,Alexandra Birch,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes privacy profiles—natural language instructions for controlling data exposure—to balance privacy and performance when using LLMs. A framework with a local model rewrites queries based on these profiles. The PEEP dataset supports this research, showing lightweight LLMs can partially follow instructions but need improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users risk exposing sensitive data when using commercial LLM APIs. The goal is to empower users to control their data via privacy profiles.

Method: A local model rewrites queries using privacy profiles to hide sensitive details before sending to external LLMs. The PEEP dataset, with annotated private content and synthetic profiles, supports experimentation.

Result: Lightweight LLMs can partially follow privacy profiles but struggle with consistent compliance, indicating a need for better models.

Conclusion: Privacy profiles offer a promising approach for data control, but LLMs need improvement to fully understand and comply with user-defined privacy preferences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but
this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this
paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy
profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should
not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these
instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the
user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with
performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual
dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with
synthetic privacy profiles. Our experiments with lightweight LLMs show they can
follow these instructions to some extent, but also face consistent challenges,
highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with
user-defined privacy preferences.

### [12] [Learn Globally, Speak Locally: Bridging the Gaps in Multilingual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05418)
*Jaedong Hwang,Kumar Tanmay,Seok-Jin Lee,Ayush Agrawal,Hamid Palangi,Kumar Ayush,Ila Fiete,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoFact-X, a multilingual benchmark for factual reasoning, and BRIDGE, a training method to improve LLMs' multilingual reasoning fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in multilingual reasoning, especially for low-resource languages, due to biases toward high-resource languages like English. This affects accuracy and trust.

Method: Developed GeoFact-X with annotated reasoning traces in five languages and proposed BRIDGE, a training method using language-consistency rewards for fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: BRIDGE significantly improves multilingual reasoning fidelity, showing the importance of reasoning-aware reinforcement learning for cross-lingual generalization.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for explicit multilingual reasoning training and introduces tools for scalable evaluation beyond surface-level metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like
mathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning
capabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource
languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or
default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource
languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current
multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models
actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce
GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with
annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese,
Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that
guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a
language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language.
Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to
assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning
traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics.
Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning
fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement
learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.

### [13] ["Lost-in-the-Later": Framework for Quantifying Contextual Grounding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05424)
*Yufei Tao,Adam Hiatt,Rahul Seetharaman,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoPE evaluates how LLMs prioritize contextual and parametric knowledge, revealing a 'lost-in-the-later' bias and showing CoT prompting degrades contextual grounding. CK-informed prompting improves factual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs integrate and prioritize contextual (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK), which remains underexplored.

Method: Introduces CoPE, a framework using the MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English, Spanish, and Danish to analyze LLMs' knowledge integration in open-ended QA.

Result: Uncovers 'lost-in-the-later' bias, where LLMs overlook later context. CoT prompting reduces recall and contextual grounding. CK-informed prompting improves factual grounding.

Conclusion: CoPE provides insights into LLMs' knowledge integration, highlighting biases and offering methods to improve contextual grounding.

Abstract: Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and
parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources
remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that
systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK)
across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English,
Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate
context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question
answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where
LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given
context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding.
We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted
with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models
without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting,
in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to
degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based
methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to
summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual
grounding and reduces hallucination.

### [14] [Gendered Divides in Online Discussions about Reproductive Rights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05443)
*Ashwin Rao,Sze Yuh Nina Wang,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes 10M abortion-related tweets, revealing gender and location shape abortion discourse, with a pronounced gender gap in conservative areas. The Dobbs ruling intensified online engagement, especially among pro-abortion women in threatened regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how gender and local sociopolitical contexts interact to shape public discourse on abortion, beyond ideological divides.

Method: Analyzed nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X (Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology, and location.

Result: Gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional expression, especially in conservative regions, creating a pronounced gender gap. The Dobbs leak intensified engagement, mobilizing pro-abortion women in threatened areas.

Conclusion: Abortion discourse is polarized by ideology, gender, and place, emphasizing identity's role in political expression during institutional disruptions.

Abstract: The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
Organization marked a turning point in the national debate over reproductive
rights. While the ideological divide over abortion is well documented, less is
known about how gender and local sociopolitical contexts interact to shape
public discourse. Drawing on nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X
(formerly Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology and location, we
show that gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional
expression, particularly in conservative regions, and independently of
ideology. This creates a gender gap in abortion attitudes that grows more
pronounced in conservative regions. The leak of the Dobbs draft opinion further
intensified online engagement, disproportionately mobilizing pro-abortion women
in areas where access was under threat. These findings reveal that abortion
discourse is not only ideologically polarized but also deeply structured by
gender and place, highlighting the central role of identity in shaping
political expression during moments of institutional disruption.

*Sana Kang,Myeongseok Gwon,Su Young Kwon,Jaewook Lee,Andrew Lan,Bhiksha Raj,Rita Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PhoniTale, a cross-lingual mnemonic system, aids L2 vocabulary learning by generating phonologically similar L1 keyword mnemonics using LLMs, performing comparably to human-authored mnemonics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of L2 vocabulary acquisition, especially for typologically distant languages, and expanding mnemonic research beyond native English speakers.

Method: PhoniTale retrieves L1 keyword sequences based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics, evaluated via automated metrics, human evaluations, and a recall test.

Result: PhoniTale performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics, demonstrating practical effectiveness in aiding vocabulary recall.

Conclusion: PhoniTale shows promise for L2 vocabulary learning, with identified areas for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2)
learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as
English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate
vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's
first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this
research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,
rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel
cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence
based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We
evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,
comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated
approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term
recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale
performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas
for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

### [16] [On the Semantics of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05448)
*Martin Schuele*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLMs like ChatGPT truly understand language, focusing on their semantic capabilities at word and sentence levels using classical theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the extent of LLMs' language understanding, addressing the controversy around their semantic abilities.

Method: Analyzes LLMs' inner workings and language representations, referencing Frege and Russell's semantic theories.

Result: Provides a nuanced understanding of LLMs' potential semantic capabilities.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit some semantic understanding, but the extent and nature of this understanding require further examination.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrated the potential to
replicate human language abilities through technology, ranging from text
generation to engaging in conversations. However, it remains controversial to
what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by
narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence
level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated
representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by
Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic
capabilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MODELCITIZENS, a dataset for toxicity detection, highlighting the subjectivity of toxicity and the need for diverse annotations. It also releases finetuned models (LLAMACITIZEN-8B, GEMMACITIZEN-12B) that outperform existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current toxicity detection models ignore diverse annotator perspectives and context-specific notions of toxicity, leading to biased or incomplete moderation.

Method: The authors create MODELCITIZENS, a dataset with 6.8K posts and 40K annotations, and augment it with LLM-generated conversational context. They finetune LLaMA- and Gemma-based models on this data.

Result: Existing tools underperform on MODELCITIZENS, especially with context-augmented posts. The finetuned models outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5%.

Conclusion: Community-informed annotation and modeling are crucial for inclusive and accurate toxicity detection.

Abstract: Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive
online spaces. However, it is a highly subjective task, with perceptions of
toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing
toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse
diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important
context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language. To address
this, we introduce MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K
toxicity annotations across diverse identity groups. To capture the role of
conversational context on toxicity, typical of social media posts, we augment
MODELCITIZENS posts with LLM-generated conversational scenarios.
State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools (e.g. OpenAI Moderation API,
GPT-o4-mini) underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on
context-augmented posts. Finally, we release LLAMACITIZEN-8B and
GEMMACITIZEN-12B, LLaMA- and Gemma-based models finetuned on MODELCITIZENS,
which outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% on in-distribution evaluations. Our
findings highlight the importance of community-informed annotation and modeling
for inclusive content moderation.

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' performance on underexplored clinical NLP tasks—structured reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction—using private and open-source datasets, proposes an agentic pipeline for data generation, and releases new datasets (SYNUR, SIMORD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and sensitivity in high-impact clinical NLP tasks to reduce healthcare documentation burden and improve patient care focus.

Method: Evaluates open- and closed-weight LLMs on private and open-source datasets, proposes an agentic pipeline for generating non-sensitive nurse dictations.

Result: Performance analysis of LLMs on the tasks, introduction of SYNUR and SIMORD datasets for further research.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for clinical NLP tasks; released datasets support future research in nurse observation and medical order extraction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong
performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple
medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular
reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from
doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and
sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these
real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on
healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we
investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical
datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and
analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose
an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations,
enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further
research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source
datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.

TL;DR: R2-LLMs is a hierarchical retrieval-augmented framework enhancing test-time scaling in LLMs without CoT distillation, improving reasoning accuracy via dual-level retrieval and MCTS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve inference-time generalization in LLMs without relying on distillation from advanced models for CoT training data.

Method: Uses dual-level retrieval (coarse for problem-answer pairs, fine for intermediate steps) and MCTS with a process reward model (PRM) for step-wise refinement.

Result: Achieves up to 16% improvement on MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO datasets with LLaMA-3.1-8B.

Conclusion: R2-LLMs effectively enhances complex reasoning tasks by integrating hierarchical retrieval and step-level refinement.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
leveraging additional computational resources at inference time to enhance
model performance. In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile
hierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve
test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring
distillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating
dual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our
approach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and
retrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context
learning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs
efficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference
mathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a
process reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical
reasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while
seamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods. Utilizing PRM, it
refines both candidate generation and decision-making for improved reasoning
accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO
datasets achieve substantial relative improvement with an increase of up to 16%
using LLaMA-3.1-8B compared to the baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of
our approach in complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: Re5 is a self-evaluation and revision framework for LLMs that improves instruction-following performance while preserving output quality, achieving results comparable to high-performance models with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving LLM adherence to instructions face challenges like high costs, quality degradation, and limited self-evaluation capabilities.

Method: Re5 extracts task and constraint components, performs structural evaluations, and applies fine-grained content evaluations with selective revisions.

Result: Re5 matches GPT-4o-mini performance with less data, maintaining quality (64.24%-win rate over non-revised outputs).

Conclusion: Re5 is an efficient, effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs)
adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective
approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.
However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a
single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have
been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision
iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a
resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage
high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation
capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a
degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed
to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of
the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user
instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,
and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by
selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving
improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,
enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative
refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves
instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data
generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of
data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the
non-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and
effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external
supervision.

### [21] [Flipping Knowledge Distillation: Leveraging Small Models' Expertise to Enhance LLMs in Text Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05617)
*Mingzhe Li,Jing Xiang,Qishen Zhang,Kaiyang Wan,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A flipped knowledge distillation paradigm where a Large Language Model (LLM) learns from a Smaller Language Model (SLM) to combine domain-specific strengths of SLMs with LLMs' semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuned smaller models excel in domain-specific tasks like text matching, but LLMs offer broader semantic understanding. Combining both strengths can enhance performance.

Method: Reinterpret LLMs as encoder-decoder models using LoRA, with the encoder generating compressed representations and the decoder mapping them. Train using Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) to align similarity scores from the SLM teacher.

Result: Improved performance on financial and healthcare benchmarks, with successful real-world deployment.

Conclusion: The flipped distillation paradigm effectively leverages SLMs' domain expertise and LLMs' semantic richness, validated by practical applications.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large
Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such
as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective
domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of
input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the
rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge
distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the
architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by
reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder
generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output
space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their
similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the
teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.
The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and
adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative
samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing
the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and
healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its
effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

TL;DR: SARA improves RAG by balancing fine-grained text snippets and semantic compression vectors, enhancing answer relevance and correctness under tight context budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in RAG like limited context length and redundancy in retrieved documents while preserving factual accuracy.

Method: Combines natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors for efficient context representation and dynamic reranking.

Result: Improves answer relevance (+17.71), correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53) across 9 datasets and 5 LLMs.

Conclusion: Integrating textual and compressed representations is key for robust, context-efficient RAG.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but faces key challenges: restricted effective context
length and redundancy in retrieved documents. Pure compression-based approaches
reduce input size but often discard fine-grained details essential for factual
accuracy. We propose SARA, a unified RAG framework that balances local
precision and global knowledge coverage under tight context budgets. SARA
combines natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors to
jointly enhance context efficiency and answer correctness. It represents
contexts at two complementary levels: 1) fine-grained natural-language spans
that preserve critical entities and numerical values, and 2) compact,
interpretable vectors that summarize high-level semantics. An iterative
evidence-selection module employs the compression vectors for dynamic reranking
of contexts. Across 9 datasets and 5 open-source LLMs spanning 3 model families
(Mistral, Llama, and Gemma), SARA consistently improves answer relevance
(+17.71), answer correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53),
demonstrating the importance of integrating textual and compressed
representations for robust, context-efficient RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG benchmarks for non-English languages like Russian are scarce and static, failing to reflect real-world dynamics.

Method: DRAGON uses a dynamic news corpus, Knowledge Graph-based question generation, and supports retriever and generator evaluation.

Result: A reusable framework with automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, benchmark data, and a public leaderboard is released.

Conclusion: DRAGON addresses the lack of dynamic RAG benchmarks for Russian and encourages community participation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted approach for
improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge at inference time. Although there exist multiple RAG
benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including
Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of
real-world deployments.
  In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first
dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news
corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and
public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever
and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with
the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the
extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns.
We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for
automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially
reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We
also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIRAG, a method to enhance RAG models with hierarchical abilities (filtering, combination, RAG-specific reasoning) using progressive chain-of-thought processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing gaps in RAG systems, such as inconsistent document quality and lack of granular focus on RAG tasks, by improving the model's hierarchical abilities.

Method: Proposes HIRAG, a fine-tuning method incorporating a 'think before answering' strategy with multi-level progressive chain-of-thought.

Result: HIRAG significantly improves performance on datasets like RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

Conclusion: HIRAG enhances RAG models' capabilities, demonstrating effectiveness in handling real-time and domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for
addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time
information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily
rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model
itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG
generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document
quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that
fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG
task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To
address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively
hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant
information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information
across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further
process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new
RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering"
strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by
utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the
HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on
datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of strong correlation in expert choices across layers in traditional MoE methods, aiming for better cooperation and specialization.

Method: Proposes a shared router (Omni-router) across MoE layers to enhance expert collaboration, tested on large-scale ASR datasets.

Result: Achieves lower training loss and reduces word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2% compared to dense and Switch Transformer models.

Conclusion: The Omni-router Transformer improves ASR performance, robustness, and expert usage efficiency.

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling
to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the
Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis
reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly
correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the
cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater
specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call
this model \emph{Omni-router Transformer}. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse,
out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is
able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and
Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%,
respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness
to diverse data.

Method: Transform related documents into multi-turn dialogues (DocTalk) for pre-training.

Result: 40% gain in context memory and understanding for LLMs.

Conclusion: DocTalk enhances LLMs' conversational abilities without degrading base performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in multi-turn
conversational tasks, yet their pre-training data predominantly consists of
continuous prose, creating a potential mismatch between required capabilities
and training paradigms. We introduce a novel approach to address this
discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We
present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into
an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our
pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training
dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that
exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can
enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory
and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during
pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding,
without compromising base performance. DocTalk is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LVLMs' capabilities in understanding and completing occluded objects in texts, a task central to human perception.

Method: Constructed a benchmark using Basic Formal Ontology for systematic classification of amodal completion tasks.

Result: LVLMs show human-comparable performance overall but struggle with specific object types and Japanese prompts, revealing linguistic deficiencies.

Conclusion: LVLMs need improvement in handling linguistic nuances, particularly in non-English contexts, to match human-like amodal completion abilities.

Abstract: One of the main objectives in developing large vision-language models (LVLMs)
is to engineer systems that can assist humans with multimodal tasks, including
interpreting descriptions of perceptual experiences. A central phenomenon in
this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when
parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed
whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions,
the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain
unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic
Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion.
Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance
overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed.
Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking
visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese
prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence
among these models.

### [33] [How to Evaluate Automatic Speech Recognition: Comparing Different Performance and Bias Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05885)
*Tanvina Patel,Wiebke Hutiri,Aaron Yi Ding,Odette Scharenborg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares performance and bias measures for Dutch ASR systems, highlighting the insufficiency of averaged error rates and recommending additional measures for better evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive methods for measuring performance and bias in ASR systems, especially for diverse speaker groups.

Method: Comparison of various performance and bias measures, including literature-based and proposed ones, applied to state-of-the-art Dutch ASR systems with bias mitigation strategies.

Result: Averaged error rates alone are inadequate; supplementary measures are needed to accurately assess performance and bias across diverse speaker groups.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided for improved reporting of ASR performance and bias to ensure fair evaluation for all speaker groups.

Abstract: There is increasingly more evidence that automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems are biased against different speakers and speaker groups, e.g., due to
gender, age, or accent. Research on bias in ASR has so far primarily focused on
detecting and quantifying bias, and developing mitigation approaches. Despite
this progress, the open question is how to measure the performance and bias of
a system. In this study, we compare different performance and bias measures,
from literature and proposed, to evaluate state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR
systems for Dutch. Our experiments use several bias mitigation strategies to
address bias against different speaker groups. The findings reveal that
averaged error rates, a standard in ASR research, alone is not sufficient and
should be supplemented by other measures. The paper ends with recommendations
for reporting ASR performance and bias to better represent a system's
performance for diverse speaker groups, and overall system bias.

*Sungjib Lim,Woojung Song,Eun-Ju Lee,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for virtual respondent simulation using LLMs to validate survey items for large language models, ensuring construct validity efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable survey item generation for LLMs and ensuring construct validity without costly human data collection.

Method: Simulating respondents with diverse mediators to identify robust survey items. Experiments on psychological trait theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA).

Result: LLMs effectively generate plausible mediators and simulate respondent behavior, identifying high-validity items.

Conclusion: The framework offers cost-effective survey development and insights into LLM replication of human-like behavior, with public release of dataset and code.

Abstract: As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large
language models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for
LLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct
validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended
trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.
To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation
using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which
the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By
simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that
robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait
theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and
simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate
the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to
simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,
metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective
survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like
behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.

*Sebastian Pohl,Max Ploner,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the robustness of evaluation methodologies for knowledge editors in model editing, highlighting biases and impacts on model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration into the robustness of evaluation methodologies for knowledge editors and their impact on model capabilities.

Method: Analyzed different metrics, evaluation methodologies, and edit batch sizes, and included manual assessment of string-matching evaluation.

Result: Found that evaluation choices can alter editor rankings and revealed false positives in string-matching methods.

Conclusion: Evaluation methodologies for knowledge editors need refinement to avoid biases and ensure accurate assessment of model impacts.

Abstract: Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years.
For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have
recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the
success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these
methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the
disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a
constant blind spot.
  We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics
and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to
a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect
also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge
editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching
based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently
released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.

### [37] [Remember Past, Anticipate Future: Learning Continual Multimodal Misinformation Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05939)
*Bing Wang,Ximing Li,Mengzhe Ye,Changchun Li,Bo Fu,Jianfeng Qu,Lin Yuanbo Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAEDCMD, a method for continual Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) to address challenges like past knowledge forgetting and evolving social environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation, especially multimodal, spreads widely on social media, causing harm. Existing MMD methods trained on offline data fail in dynamic real-world scenarios.

Method: DAEDCMD isolates event-specific parameters using a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure and learns a continuous-time dynamics model to anticipate future distributions.

Result: DAEDCMD outperforms six MMD baselines and three continual learning methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses challenges in continual MMD, improving detection performance over time.

Abstract: Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely
spread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control
their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active
topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD
methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in
real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models
trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this
issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,
inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by
two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the
detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,
the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the
generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to
remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific
parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and
anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time
dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and
significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and
three continual learning methods.

*Sandeep Mishra,Anubhab Mandal,Bishal Santra,Tushar Abhishek,Pawan Goyal,Manish Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the understudied problem of Chat-Ghosting (auto-completion in chat interfaces), comparing deep learning and non-deep learning methods using four datasets. N-gram models and tries outperform deep learning for seen prefixes, while neural models excel for unseen queries. Conversational context improves results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ghosting enhances user experience in chat interfaces, but Chat-Ghosting lacks research attention, benchmarks, and performance analysis. The study aims to fill this gap.

Method: Evaluated query auto-completion methods (tries, n-gram, deep learning) with/without dialog context on four datasets (human-human and human-bot). Proposed an entropy-based early stopping strategy.

Result: N-gram models and tries perform better for seen prefixes; neural models (T5, Phi-2) excel for unseen queries. Dialog context significantly improves ghosting quality.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into Chat-Ghosting, highlighting the strengths of different methods and the value of conversational context. Code and data are shared for further research.

Abstract: Ghosting, the ability to predict a user's intended text input for inline
query auto-completion, is an invaluable feature for modern search engines and
chat interfaces, greatly enhancing user experience. By suggesting completions
to incomplete queries (or prefixes), ghosting aids users with slow typing
speeds, disabilities, or limited language proficiency. Ghosting is a
challenging problem and has become more important with the ubiquitousness of
chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Despite the increasing
prominence of chat-based systems utilizing ghosting, this challenging problem
of Chat-Ghosting has received little attention from the NLP/ML research
community. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance
analysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods. We address this
through an open and thorough study of this problem using four publicly
available dialog datasets: two human-human (DailyDialog and DSTC7-Ubuntu) and
two human-bot (Open Assistant and ShareGPT). We experiment with various
existing query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep
learning methods, with and without dialog context. We also propose a novel
entropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy. Our analysis finds that
statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in
terms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For
unseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding
conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality,
especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT. We make code and data publicly
available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenFActScore is an open-source version of FActScore for evaluating LLM-generated text factuality, supporting any Hugging Face model. It matches closed-source performance and promotes transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a transparent, reproducible, and cost-effective alternative to the closed-source FActScore framework for evaluating LLM-generated text factuality.

Method: Uses Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract claims and Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify them against trusted sources, replacing closed-source models with Hugging Face-compatible ones.

Result: Open models like Gemma approximate closed-source performance, achieving a 0.99 Pearson correlation with original FActScore results.

Conclusion: OpenFActScore successfully offers a viable open-source alternative for factuality evaluation, enhancing transparency and accessibility.

Abstract: We introduce OpenFActScore, an open-source implementation of the FActScore
framework for evaluating the factuality of text generated by large language
models (LLMs). FActScore evaluates the factual accuracy of long-form text by
using Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract individual factual claims and
Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge
source. While the original FActScore relies on closed-source and commercial
models such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, OpenFActScore enables the use of any
Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV. We provide a detailed
technical overview of our implementation, highlighting design choices and
modifications made to support open models. We evaluate multiple open-source
LLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting
BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our
results show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source
systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup
obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments.
OpenFActScore promotes transparency, reproducibility, and cost-effective
evaluation, and is available at: https://github.com/lflage/OpenFActScore.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The ACL community lacks focus on evaluating the real-world impact of NLP systems, with only 0.1% of ACL Anthology papers addressing it meaningfully.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the gap in evaluating NLP systems' real-world impact and advocate for more practical assessments to enhance adoption and usefulness.

Method: Conducted a structured survey of the ACL Anthology to analyze the prevalence and depth of real-world impact evaluations in NLP papers.

Result: Found minimal focus (0.1%) on real-world impact, with most evaluations being superficial and metric-driven.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the need for serious evaluation of NLP's real-world impact to improve its utility and adoption.

Abstract: The ACL community has very little interest in evaluating the real-world
impact of NLP systems. A structured survey of the ACL Anthology shows that
perhaps 0.1% of its papers contain such evaluations; furthermore most papers
which include impact evaluations present them very sketchily and instead focus
on metric evaluations. NLP technology would be more useful and more quickly
adopted if we seriously tried to understand and evaluate its real-world impact.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RabakBench is a multilingual safety benchmark for low-resource languages in Singapore, addressing LLM safety classifier limitations through a scalable three-stage pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs and safety classifiers perform poorly on low-resource languages due to limited data and benchmarks. RabakBench aims to fill this gap for Singapore's linguistic context.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (i) adversarial example generation, (ii) semi-automated multi-label safety annotation, and (iii) high-fidelity translation.

Result: Over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six categories. Evaluations show significant performance degradation in existing classifiers.

Conclusion: RabakBench provides a robust framework for localized safety evaluation in low-resource settings and is publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their safety classifiers often perform
poorly on low-resource languages due to limited training data and evaluation
benchmarks. This paper introduces RabakBench, a new multilingual safety
benchmark localized to Singapore's unique linguistic context, covering
Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. RabakBench is constructed through a
scalable three-stage pipeline: (i) Generate - adversarial example generation by
augmenting real Singlish web content with LLM-driven red teaming; (ii) Label -
semi-automated multi-label safety annotation using majority-voted LLM labelers
aligned with human judgments; and (iii) Translate - high-fidelity translation
preserving linguistic nuance and toxicity across languages. The final dataset
comprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six
fine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular
open-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant
performance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation
in Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible
framework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments.
The benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and
evaluation code are publicly available.

*Minghang Zhu,Shen Gao,Zhengliang Shi,Jiabao Fang,Pengjie Ren,Zhaochun Ren,Zhumin Chen,Shuo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-evolution method for language models reduces training costs and carbon emissions by using a large-scale model to generate task principles and a smaller model for data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high carbon emissions and data leakage risks in traditional data augmentation methods using closed-source LLMs.

Method: Introduces Multi-level Principle Generation for summarizing task principles and Principle-based Instance Generation for data creation by a smaller model.

Result: Significantly improves model performance and reduces carbon emissions compared to direct data generation by smaller models.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative for language model training.

Abstract: A common training approach for language models involves using a large-scale
language model to expand a human-provided dataset, which is subsequently used
for model training.This method significantly reduces training costs by
eliminating the need for extensive human data annotation. However, it still
faces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the
risk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues,
we propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the
Multi-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to
summarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data.
Then, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a
smaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large
amount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results
show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared
to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data.
Additionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the
task-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the
model are greatly reduced.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction, addressing the scarcity of annotated corpora in zero-shot/few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large, high-quality annotated corpora are scarce for document-level entity and relation extraction, especially in zero-shot or few-shot settings.

Method: The method combines synthetic data generation with retrieval-based in-context learning using a reasoning-optimized language model, avoiding manual annotation.

Result: A synthetic dataset of 5k Wikipedia abstracts with 59k entities and 30k relation triples was produced. Evaluation on the DocIE shared task showed challenges in zero-shot document-level extraction.

Conclusion: In-context joint entity and relation extraction at document-level is challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs, even with synthetic data and retrieval-based learning.

Abstract: Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity
and relation extraction in zero-shot or few-shot settings. In this paper, we
present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and
in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In
contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations
or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation
with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language
model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without
manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference
time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$
Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation
triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE
shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a
zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction
at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large
language models.

TL;DR: A conditional multistage failure recovery framework using zero-shot chain prompting improves task execution for embodied agents, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents often face execution failures, necessitating robust recovery mechanisms.

Method: The framework employs four error-handling stages (three during execution, one post-execution) and leverages LLMs for contextual reasoning and solution generation.

Result: Outperforms baseline by 11.5% and existing models by 19% on the TfD benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses execution failures, enhancing agent performance.

Abstract: Embodied agents performing complex tasks are susceptible to execution
failures, motivating the need for effective failure recovery mechanisms. In
this work, we introduce a conditional multistage failure recovery framework
that employs zero-shot chain prompting. The framework is structured into four
error-handling stages, with three operating during task execution and one
functioning as a post-execution reflection phase. Our approach utilises the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to analyse execution challenges within their
environmental context and devise strategic solutions. We evaluate our method on
the TfD benchmark of the TEACH dataset and achieve state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming a baseline without error recovery by 11.5% and
surpassing the strongest existing model by 19%.

TL;DR: The paper explores how data entropy correlates with memorization difficulty in LLMs, introducing the Entropy-Memorization Law and a method for dataset inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and characterize the memorization difficulty of training data in LLMs, a fundamental but under-explored question.

Method: Empirical experiments on OLMo models to establish the Entropy-Memorization Law, and a case study on memorizing randomized strings.

Result: Data entropy is linearly correlated with memorization score, and randomized strings have unexpectedly low empirical entropy.

Conclusion: The findings enable a simple approach to distinguish training and testing data, facilitating Dataset Inference (DI).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training
data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In
this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the
domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training
data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models,
we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is
linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of
memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such
sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low
empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same
strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective
approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference
(DI).

keeping the model frozen. We classify existing approaches into two categories:
direct prompt learning and transfer learning. Direct prompt learning methods
include: general optimization approaches, encoder-based methods, decomposition
strategies, and mixture-of-experts frameworks. Transfer learning methods
consist of: general transfer approaches, encoder-based methods, and

TL;DR: NeoBabel is a multilingual text-to-image generation framework supporting six languages, outperforming existing models in performance, efficiency, and inclusivity without sacrificing English capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the English-centric bias in text-to-image generation, which creates barriers for non-English speakers and introduces issues like semantic drift and cultural misalignment.

Method: Combines large-scale multilingual pretraining with high-resolution instruction tuning, evaluated using expanded multilingual benchmarks (m-GenEval and m-DPG).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance (0.75 on m-GenEval, 0.68 on m-DPG) and matches leading English-only models while being 2-4x smaller.

Conclusion: Multilingual capability enhances robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI, demonstrated by NeoBabel's open toolkit and inclusive approach.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly
English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating
digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these
introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We
introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a
new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six
languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is
trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and
high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two
English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG.
NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining
strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG.
Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while
outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though
these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending
crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously
assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably,
NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We
release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated
dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual
evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates
that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved
robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Code Triangle framework to evaluate LLMs in code generation, revealing gaps in diversity and robustness compared to humans. It suggests human input and model mixtures can improve LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess LLMs' programming competence and identify limitations in their code generation capabilities.

Method: The Code Triangle framework evaluates LLMs across editorial analysis, code implementation, and test case generation using competitive programming benchmarks.

Result: LLMs show self-consistency but lack diversity and robustness. Human input and model mixtures enhance performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' cognitive gaps and proposes human collaboration and self-improvement as paths to better coding models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code
generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We
introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs
across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation,
and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive
programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent
system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and
robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift
between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to
cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study
demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and
diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially
enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal
both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may
facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential
direction for developing more powerful coding models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance visual reasoning by leveraging text-only LLMs' reasoning skills and improve cross-modal alignment without additional pre-training.

Method: Uses a post-training RL framework to activate reasoning, introduces a connector module for cross-modal alignment, and employs entropy of critical reasoning tokens for checkpoint selection.

Result: Achieves 76.0% on MMMU, matching human entry-level performance, and rivals closed-source VLMs with a 38B parameter model.

Conclusion: Skywork-R1V3 demonstrates RL's power in advancing open-source VLMs and successfully transfers reasoning skills across tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model
(VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies
in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language
Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily
stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively
activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for
additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover
the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal
alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique
indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,
which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.
Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving
from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.
Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B
parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation
successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related
reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and
reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on
multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal
reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CriticLean introduces a critic-guided reinforcement learning framework to improve semantic fidelity in translating natural language math statements to formal code, outperforming baselines and providing a benchmark and dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of focus on the critic phase in automated theorem proving, ensuring generated formalizations accurately reflect the original problem's intent.

Method: Proposes CriticLeanGPT for semantic fidelity assessment and CriticLeanBench for benchmarking, trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: CriticLeanGPT outperforms baselines, and FineLeanCorpus, a dataset of 285K problems, is created with high correctness and diversity.

Conclusion: Optimizing the critic phase is crucial for reliable formalizations, and CriticLean offers insights for future formal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Translating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable
code is a fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work
has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been
paid to the critic phase-the evaluation of whether generated formalizations
truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we
introduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework
that elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active
learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained
via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the
semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench,
a benchmark designed to measure models' ability to distinguish semantically
correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained
CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong open- and
closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct
FineLeanCorpus, a dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich
domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on
human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic
phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations, and we hope our
CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal
mathematical reasoning.

Motivation: To enhance classification of subjective and objective sentences in news text by leveraging transfer-learning and controlled data augmentation.

Method: Fine-tuning pre-trained encoders, transfer-learning fine-tuned transformers, and using GPT-4o for label-consistent stylistic augmentation.

Result: Specialized encoders outperform general-purpose ones, and curated augmentation boosts robustness, especially for subjective content. The team ranked 16th out of 24.

Conclusion: Combining encoder specialization with label-consistent augmentation improves subjectivity detection.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to Task 1, Subjectivity Detection, of the
CheckThat! Lab at CLEF 2025. We investigate the effectiveness of
transfer-learning and stylistic data augmentation to improve classification of
subjective and objective sentences in English news text. Our approach contrasts
fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders and transfer-learning of fine-tuned
transformer on related tasks. We also introduce a controlled augmentation
pipeline using GPT-4o to generate paraphrases in predefined subjectivity
styles. To ensure label and style consistency, we employ the same model to
correct and refine the generated samples. Results show that transfer-learning
of specified encoders outperforms fine-tuning general-purpose ones, and that
carefully curated augmentation significantly enhances model robustness,
especially in detecting subjective content. Our official submission placed us
$16^{th}$ of 24 participants. Overall, our findings underscore the value of
combining encoder specialization with label-consistent augmentation for
improved subjectivity detection. Our code is available at

### [52] [DS@GT at CheckThat! 2025: Evaluating Context and Tokenization Strategies for Numerical Fact Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06195)
*Maximilian Heil,Aleksandar Pramov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates strategies for automated fact-checking of numerical claims, focusing on evidence retrieval and tokenization methods, finding that neither R2L tokenization nor longer context windows improve performance, with evidence quality being the key bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical claims present unique challenges for automated fact-checking, requiring specialized modeling strategies to improve veracity prediction.

Method: The study uses the QuanTemp dataset and an evidence retrieval pipeline to test the impact of longer context windows (ModernBERT), R2L tokenization, and their combination on classification performance.

Result: R2L tokenization and longer context windows did not improve performance, with evidence quality being the limiting factor. The best system achieved a macro-average F1 score of 0.57, ranking Top-4 in CheckThat! 2025 Task 3.

Conclusion: Evidence quality is the dominant bottleneck in numerical claim verification, and neither R2L tokenization nor extended context windows enhance performance significantly.

Abstract: Numerical claims, statements involving quantities, comparisons, and temporal
references, pose unique challenges for automated fact-checking systems. In this
study, we evaluate modeling strategies for veracity prediction of such claims
using the QuanTemp dataset and building our own evidence retrieval pipeline. We
investigate three key factors: (1) the impact of more evidences with longer
input context windows using ModernBERT, (2) the effect of right-to-left (R2L)
tokenization, and (3) their combined influence on classification performance.
Contrary to prior findings in arithmetic reasoning tasks, R2L tokenization does
not boost natural language inference (NLI) of numerical tasks. A longer context
window does also not enhance veracity performance either, highlighting evidence
quality as the dominant bottleneck. Our best-performing system achieves
competitive macro-average F1 score of 0.57 and places us among the Top-4
submissions in Task 3 of CheckThat! 2025. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys latent reasoning in LLMs, a method that performs multi-step inference in hidden states, bypassing natural language bottlenecks. It covers foundational concepts, methodologies, and advanced paradigms like infinite-depth reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of chain-of-thought reasoning's dependence on natural language, which restricts expressive bandwidth, by exploring latent reasoning in LLMs.

Method: Examines neural network layers as reasoning substrates, explores methodologies like activation-based recurrence and hidden state propagation, and discusses advanced paradigms such as masked diffusion models.

Result: Provides a unified overview of latent reasoning, highlighting its potential to enhance LLM cognition beyond explicit reasoning methods.

Conclusion: The survey clarifies the latent reasoning landscape and outlines future research directions, with an associated GitHub repository for further exploration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both
interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning
limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this
bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's
continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent
reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role
of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,
highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.
Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including
activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning
strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we
discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked
diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning
processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual
landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the
frontier of LLM cognition. An associated GitHub repository collecting the

### [56] [Efficiency-Effectiveness Reranking FLOPs for LLM-based Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06223)
*Zhiyuan Peng,Ting-ruen Wei,Tingyu Song,Yilun Zhao,Yi Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces E²R-FLOPs, new metrics for evaluating LLM-based rerankers, addressing inefficiency in existing proxy metrics by focusing on relevance per compute (RPP) and hardware-agnostic throughput (QPP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efficiency metrics for LLM-based rerankers are hardware-dependent and fail to account for model size, making it hard to evaluate the efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff.

Method: Proposes E²R-FLOPs (ranking metrics per PetaFLOP) and an interpretable FLOPs estimator to evaluate rerankers without experiments.

Result: Comprehensive experiments evaluate various LLM-based rerankers, analyzing their efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff.

Conclusion: The new metrics provide a clearer evaluation of LLM-based rerankers, highlighting the efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff for the research community.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in
information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high
computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies
evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as
latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.
However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg
parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,
making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the
efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose
E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per
PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for
hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable
FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even
without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct
comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with
different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and
bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

TL;DR: Agent KB is a hierarchical experience framework improving language agents' error correction and experience reuse via a Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline, boosting success rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language agents struggle with error correction and cross-domain experience reuse, limiting their problem-solving capabilities.

Method: Agent KB uses a Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline and a shared knowledge base to enable cross-agent knowledge transfer.

Result: Agent KB improves success rates by up to 16.28 percentage points on GAIA and SWE-bench tasks, with notable gains for Claude-3 and GPT-4.

Conclusion: Agent KB offers a modular, framework-agnostic solution for agents to learn from past experiences and generalize strategies.

Abstract: As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with
effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce
Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic
problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses
a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's
experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution
logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent
knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success
rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3
improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on
intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to
improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a
modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from
past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.

### [58] [Structured Captions Improve Prompt Adherence in Text-to-Image Models (Re-LAION-Caption 19M)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05300)
*Nicholas Merchant,Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde,Andrei Cristian Popescu,Carlos Garcia Jurado Suarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Structured captions improve text-to-image model alignment by enforcing consistency in training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models struggle with prompt adherence due to noisy datasets, requiring excessive prompt engineering.

Method: Created Re-LAION-Caption 19M with structured captions (subject, setting, aesthetics, camera details) and fine-tuned PixArt-Σ and Stable Diffusion 2.

Result: Structured captions yielded higher text-image alignment scores in VQA evaluations.

Conclusion: Enforcing caption structure enhances model controllability and alignment, reducing reliance on prompt engineering.

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt
adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like
LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit
desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption
structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and
alignment. We introduce Re-LAION-Caption 19M, a high-quality subset of
Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by
a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part
template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune
PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly
shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher
text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The
dataset is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CorrDetail is a visual detail enhanced self-correction framework for interpretable deepfake detection, addressing limitations of existing methods by focusing on authentic forgery details and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of deepfake technology necessitates reliable detection methods, as current approaches lack interpretability or suffer from hallucinations.

Method: CorrDetail uses error-guided questioning to correct forgery details and includes a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module for precision. A fusion decision strategy integrates visual compensation and bias reduction.

Result: CorrDetail outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and generalization, effectively identifying forged details.

Conclusion: CorrDetail offers a robust, interpretable solution for deepfake detection, enhancing reliability and performance.

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread
emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of
security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake
detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be
categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal
approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details,
while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone
to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a
visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for
interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to
rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning,
with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than
yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of
its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated,
supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a
fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's
discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of
visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results
demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying
forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

efficient C3Ghost modules, a novel SimSPPF module for enhanced multi-scale
feature pooling, the Mish activation function for improved optimization, and an
Intelligent Gather & Distribute (IGD) module for superior feature fusion in the
network's neck. The concept of leveraging vehicle steering dynamics for
adaptive region-of-interest processing is also presented. Comprehensive
evaluations on a custom CARLA dataset simulating complex scenarios demonstrate
that YOLO-APD achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy, reaching 77.7%
mAP@0.5:0.95 and exceptional pedestrian recall exceeding 96%, significantly
outperforming baseline models, including YOLOv8. Furthermore, it maintains
real-time processing capabilities at 100 FPS, showcasing a superior balance
between accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies validate the synergistic
contribution of each integrated component. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset
confirms the architecture's potential while highlighting the need for domain
adaptation. This research advances the development of highly accurate,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual staining methods treat all pixels equally, reproducing noise instead of focusing on meaningful cellular structures.

Method: Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss and employs Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware learning.

Result: Applied to a 3D dataset, Spotlight improves morphological representation and preserves pixel-level accuracy, enhancing virtual stains for tasks like segmentation.

Conclusion: Spotlight offers a more effective virtual staining approach by prioritizing biologically relevant signals, benefiting downstream applications.

Abstract: Microscopy enables direct observation of cellular morphology in 3D, with
transmitted-light methods offering low-cost, minimally invasive imaging and
fluorescence microscopy providing specificity and contrast. Virtual staining
combines these strengths by using machine learning to predict fluorescence
images from label-free inputs. However, training of existing methods typically
relies on loss functions that treat all pixels equally, thus reproducing
background noise and artifacts instead of focusing on biologically meaningful
signals. We introduce Spotlight, a simple yet powerful virtual staining
approach that guides the model to focus on relevant cellular structures.
Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss
and to calculate a Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing food security challenges by leveraging foundation models for agricultural monitoring, as current applications in agriculture are under-explored.

Method: Quantitative evaluation of existing foundational models, development of a requirements framework (CropFM), and empirical evaluation of two models in three agricultural tasks.

Result: Existing models show potential but lack specialization for agriculture, emphasizing the need for a tailored foundational model.

Conclusion: A dedicated agricultural foundation model (CropFM) is necessary to effectively address agricultural challenges like crop mapping, phenology, and yield estimation.

Abstract: Food security remains a global concern as population grows and climate change
intensifies, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable agricultural
productivity. Recent advances in foundation models have demonstrated remarkable
performance in remote sensing and climate sciences, and therefore offer new
opportunities for agricultural monitoring. However, their application in
challenges related to agriculture-such as crop type mapping, crop phenology
estimation, and crop yield estimation-remains under-explored. In this work, we
quantitatively evaluate existing foundational models to assess their
effectivity for a representative set of agricultural tasks. From an
agricultural domain perspective, we describe a requirements framework for an
ideal agricultural foundation model (CropFM). We then survey and compare
existing general-purpose foundational models in this framework and empirically
evaluate two exemplary of them in three representative agriculture specific
tasks. Finally, we highlight the need for a dedicated foundational model
tailored specifically to agriculture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve underwater image quality by leveraging deep learning and incorporating human subjective evaluations.

Method: Train a classifier to distinguish image quality, then use GANs with enhancement criteria (e.g., color fidelity, sharpness) to refine low-quality images.

Result: The model improves both perceived and measured image quality, validated by metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM.

Conclusion: Incorporating human assessments and specific enhancement criteria in GANs significantly boosts underwater image quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, particularly neural networks, have
significantly impacted a wide range of fields, including the automatic
enhancement of underwater images. This paper presents a deep learning-based
approach to improving underwater image quality by integrating human subjective
assessments into the training process. To this end, we utilize publicly
available datasets containing underwater images labeled by experts as either
high or low quality. Our method involves first training a classifier network to
distinguish between high- and low-quality images. Subsequently, generative
adversarial networks (GANs) are trained using various enhancement criteria to
refine the low-quality images. The performance of the GAN models is evaluated
using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM, as well as through
qualitative analysis. Results demonstrate that the proposed model --
particularly when incorporating criteria such as color fidelity and image
sharpness -- achieves substantial improvements in both perceived and measured
image quality.

Motivation: Adapting VLMs like CLIP to decentralized, heterogeneous data without sacrificing generalization is challenging.

Method: Uses multi-modal adapters with modality-specific layers and a shared projection, optimized asymmetrically for local personalization and global generalization.

Result: Outperforms federated prompt tuning methods, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs in personalization and generalization.

Conclusion: pFedMMA effectively balances personalization and generalization in federated learning for vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to
decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has
emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated
learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of
personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this
work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework
that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter
contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally
shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization
strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions
while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global
generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared
component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across
eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that
pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and
generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code

TL;DR: LoongX is a hands-free image editing system using neurophysiological signals (EEG, fNIRS, PPG, head motion) to drive generative models, achieving performance comparable to text-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image editing is labor-intensive and inaccessible for some. LoongX aims to make it intuitive and accessible using brain-computer interfaces and generative models.

Method: LoongX integrates cross-scale state space (CS3) and dynamic gated fusion (DGF) modules to process multimodal neuro signals, aligning them with edit semantics via a diffusion transformer (DiT). Pre-training uses contrastive learning.

Result: LoongX matches text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558) and outperforms them with combined neural-speech signals (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549).

Conclusion: LoongX demonstrates the potential of neural-driven generative models for accessible image editing, paving the way for cognitive-driven creative technologies.

Abstract: Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it
labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or
language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing
approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes
state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928
image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography
(EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography
(PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address
the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The
cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific
features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these
features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics
via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train
the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic
intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I:
0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural
signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results
highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling
accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for
cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to
support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.

*Lanqing Guo,Yufei Wang,Hezhen Hu,Yan Zheng,Yeying Jin,Siyu Huang,Zhangyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for precise 3D scene local editing using 2D diffusion and inverse rendering, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a 4× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D semantic parsing underperforms compared to 2D, making targeted 3D edits difficult. The goal is to enhance control and fidelity in local scene edits.

Method: Leverages 2D diffusion for region identification, inverse rendering for 3D localization, and refines views with iterative editing for coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 4× speedup, enabling efficient and effective local edits.

Conclusion: The approach improves 3D scene editing by combining 2D and 3D techniques for better precision and speed.

Abstract: Many 3D scene editing tasks focus on modifying local regions rather than the
entire scene, except for some global applications like style transfer, and in
the context of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), where scenes are represented by a
series of Gaussians, this structure allows for precise regional edits, offering
enhanced control over specific areas of the scene; however, the challenge lies
in the fact that 3D semantic parsing often underperforms compared to its 2D
counterpart, making targeted manipulations within 3D spaces more difficult and
limiting the fidelity of edits, which we address by leveraging 2D diffusion
editing to accurately identify modification regions in each view, followed by
inverse rendering for 3D localization, then refining the frontal view and
initializing a coarse 3DGS with consistent views and approximate shapes derived
from depth maps predicted by a 2D foundation model, thereby supporting an
iterative, view-consistent editing process that gradually enhances structural
details and textures to ensure coherence across perspectives. Experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering up to a $4\times$ speedup, providing a more efficient and effective
approach to 3D scene local editing.

Motivation: To address the challenge of segmenting objects based on diverse and unseen language prompts by grounding textual semantics into precise spatial masks.

Method: Integrates multi-modal embeddings from a lightweight VLM into SAM2, freezing pre-trained components and training only 4.5M parameters. Uses positional tie-breaker embeddings and cross-attention for instance awareness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation across benchmarks like ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.

Conclusion: OpenWorldSAM is a flexible, efficient, and generalizable framework for open-vocabulary segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a
critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise
spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present
OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model
v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings
extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is
guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a
diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language
descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks.
ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we
train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving
remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's
spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and
cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances.
iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities,
generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts
without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic,
instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including
ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.

TL;DR: An AI-driven variable rate sprayer system using YOLO11n models detects weeds and adjusts herbicide spray in real time, showing high precision and adaptability to canopy sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses issues of uniform herbicide use, such as high costs, pollution, and herbicide-resistant weeds, by enabling targeted application.

Method: Integrates YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg models on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for real-time weed detection and canopy segmentation, with Arduino-controlled nozzles.

Result: Achieved high precision (0.99) and recall (~1.0) for detection, with spray coverage adapting to canopy size (16.22% to 21.65%).

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential for selective herbicide application using AI and low-cost hardware, with plans to expand weed detection and validate in field trials.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes
to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of
herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision
guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed
presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation
in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep
learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,
and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated
nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted
using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to
simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean
average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close
to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision
of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water
sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones
where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%
for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,
respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based
on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining
real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide
application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to
include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus
tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed
by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn
production systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using large vision models and naturalistic driving videos to identify cognitive decline in older drivers, enabling early detection and proactive intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diagnostic methods for cognitive decline (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment) are time-consuming and costly. This research aims to provide a scalable, non-invasive alternative by analyzing driving behavior.

Method: Leverages large vision models to analyze naturalistic driving videos, extracting 'digital fingerprints' correlated with cognitive decline. The framework classifies cognitive status and predicts disease progression.

Result: Identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, enabling proactive intervention.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances early detection of cognitive decline, offering a scalable and non-invasive monitoring solution to reduce societal and economic burdens.

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers
from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times,
cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly
nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior
captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital
fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of
MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights
from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive
decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic
driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and
predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between
real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status
of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our
method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to
proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and
supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to
mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the
aging population.

### [71] [Cloud Diffusion Part 1: Theory and Motivation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05496)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes replacing white noise with scale-invariant noise in diffusion models for image generation, arguing for benefits like faster inference and better detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural images exhibit scale-invariant statistical properties, unlike the white noise traditionally used in diffusion models. This mismatch suggests room for improvement.

Method: Introduce scale-invariant noise profiles ("Cloud Diffusion Model") in place of white noise in diffusion models.

Result: Expected benefits include faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and greater controllability.

Conclusion: A follow-up study will validate the proposed Cloud Diffusion Model against traditional white noise diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise
to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise.
The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based
on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is
independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type
of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by
a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable
sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale
correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant
noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white
noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these
models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and
greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud
Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare
it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoomNet is a multi-view diffusion architecture that generates consistent multi-view images from a single input, improving 3D mesh quality by leveraging a shared latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of generating spatially consistent multi-view images from a single image, which often degrades 3D mesh quality in surface reconstruction.

Method: LoomNet applies a diffusion model in parallel across multiple views, fuses encodings from all views into aggregated planes, and processes these to ensure coherence.

Result: LoomNet produces 16 high-quality, coherent views in 15 seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in image quality and reconstruction metrics.

Conclusion: LoomNet effectively addresses multi-view consistency, demonstrating creativity and superior performance in generating diverse, plausible novel views.

Abstract: Generating consistent multi-view images from a single image remains
challenging. Lack of spatial consistency often degrades 3D mesh quality in
surface reconstruction. To address this, we propose LoomNet, a novel multi-view
diffusion architecture that produces coherent images by applying the same
diffusion model multiple times in parallel to collaboratively build and
leverage a shared latent space for view consistency. Each viewpoint-specific
inference generates an encoding representing its own hypothesis of the novel
view from a given camera pose, which is projected onto three orthogonal planes.
For each plane, encodings from all views are fused into a single aggregated
plane. These aggregated planes are then processed to propagate information and
interpolate missing regions, combining the hypotheses into a unified, coherent
interpretation. The final latent space is then used to render consistent
multi-view images. LoomNet generates 16 high-quality and coherent views in just
15 seconds. In our experiments, LoomNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
both image quality and reconstruction metrics, also showing creativity by
producing diverse, plausible novel views from the same input.

ViDoRe V2, placing first on both leaderboards as of June 27, 2025.
  Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM),
modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional

fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this
mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in

Conclusion: The toolkit supports perception research in African contexts without costly data collection or simulation.

Abstract: The scarcity of autonomous vehicle datasets from developing regions,

tailored to challenging African driving scenarios. Our refractive module
simulates optical effects from low-quality lenses and air turbulence, including
lens distortion, Perlin noise, Thin-Plate Spline (TPS), and divergence-free

fog, and lens flare. To establish a benchmark, we provide baseline performance
using three image restoration models. To support perception research in
underrepresented African contexts, without costly data collection, labeling, or

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReLayout improves content-aware layout generation by using relation-CoT to better interpret spatial relationships and introduce structured, recursive layouts, outperforming existing LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods struggle with interpreting spatial relationships among visual themes and design elements, leading to structural and diversity issues in layout generation.

Method: ReLayout enhances layout annotations with explicit relation definitions (e.g., region, salient, margin) and introduces a layout prototype rebalance sampler to address data bias and uniformity issues.

Result: ReLayout generates more structured, diverse, and aesthetically coherent layouts, aligning better with human aesthetics and explainability.

Conclusion: ReLayout addresses key limitations of LLM-based layout generation, offering a more effective and interpretable solution.

Abstract: Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given
canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has
been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts
automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based
methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes
and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout
generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that
leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent
layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we
enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such
as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing
the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling
the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined
relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines
layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct
layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that
arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive
experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can
generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human
aesthetics and more explainable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CTNet, a Cross-modal Transition-guided Network, to improve multi-modal face anti-spoofing by leveraging consistent feature transitions for live samples and inconsistent ones for spoof detection, while addressing missing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal FAS faces challenges like distribution discrepancies and missing modalities. The authors exploit smaller visual differences in live faces and consistent cross-modal transitions to enhance robustness.

Method: CTNet learns consistent cross-modal feature transitions for live samples and inconsistent ones for spoof detection. It also learns complementary IR and depth features from RGB to handle missing modalities.

Result: CTNet outperforms previous multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

Conclusion: CTNet effectively addresses multi-modal FAS challenges by leveraging feature transitions and auxiliary modalities, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by
extracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB,
infrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric
authentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are
typically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental
conditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution
discrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.
Furthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater
challenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this
paper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to
tackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from
that, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are
typically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature
transitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared
to those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose
learning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to
construct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the
inconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to
effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To
further address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning
complementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as
auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet
outperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.

TL;DR: A semi-supervised defect detection framework (DSYM) using conditional diffusion and pseudo-labels improves data efficiency and accuracy in industrial quality inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional defect detection methods are inefficient and costly, prompting the need for a robust, high-precision solution.

Method: DSYM employs a two-stage training mechanism, pseudo-label generation, and conditional diffusion for multi-scale defect synthesis, with noise filtering via CLIP features.

Result: Achieves 78.4% mAP@0.5 with full labeled data and 75.1% with only 40%, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: DSYM offers a high-precision, low-labeling-dependent solution for industrial defect detection, validated on the NEU-DET dataset.

Abstract: In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a
critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors
such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional
methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms,
suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper
introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional
diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a
staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for
initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the
generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes
multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise
filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the
NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled
data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the
labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant
advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision,
low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality
inspection scenarios. The work of this article has been open-sourced at

Method: Proposes GSVR with hybrid deformation fields (tri-plane and polynomial motion), dynamic-aware time slicing, and quantization-aware fine-tuning for compact representation.

Result: Achieves 800+ FPS, 35+ PSNR, and faster convergence (2s/frame training) on Bunny and UVG datasets, outperforming existing methods in speed and compression.

Conclusion: GSVR offers a faster, efficient alternative to convolution-based video representations, with competitive performance in interpolation and compression.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and
promising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to
improving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding
speed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing
methods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video
representation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds
per frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose
GSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS
and 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.
Specifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of
the video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and
the polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object
motion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing
strategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)
based on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion
and non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to
avoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to
compress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the
Bunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than
existing methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other
methods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task
to SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.

TL;DR: Accordion is a framework converting AI-generated graphic designs into editable layered designs, refining text and leveraging vision models for decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated designs lack editability but inspire human designers. Accordion aims to bridge this gap by making AI designs editable.

Method: Uses a vision language model (VLM) in three stages, guided by prompts, and leverages vision experts like SAM for layer decomposition.

Result: Outperforms on tasks like text-to-template and design variation, validated by user studies.

Conclusion: Accordion successfully converts AI designs into editable layers, enhancing usability and creativity.

Abstract: Graphic design is crucial for conveying ideas and messages. Designers usually
organize their work into objects, backgrounds, and vectorized text layers to
simplify editing. However, this workflow demands considerable expertise. With
the rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in
pixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack
editability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers,
influencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the
creation of layered designs. Motivated by this observation, we propose
Accordion, a graphic design generation framework taking the first attempt to
convert AI-generated designs into editable layered designs, meanwhile refining
nonsensical AI-generated text with meaningful alternatives guided by user
prompts. It is built around a vision language model (VLM) playing distinct
roles in three curated stages. For each stage, we design prompts to guide the
VLM in executing different tasks. Distinct from existing bottom-up methods
(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered
designs, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually
harmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.
Additionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element
removal models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our
method using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with
AI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a
customized inpainting model. Experimental results and user studies by designers
show that Accordion generates favorable results on the DesignIntention
benchmark, including tasks such as text-to-template, adding text to background,
and text de-rendering, and also excels in creating design variations.

### [81] [Kernel Density Steering: Inference-Time Scaling via Mode Seeking for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05604)
*Yuyang Hu,Kangfu Mei,Mojtaba Sahraee-Ardakan,Ulugbek S. Kamilov,Peyman Milanfar,Mauricio Delbracio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kernel Density Steering (KDS) improves diffusion models for image restoration by using an ensemble of samples to guide outputs toward high-fidelity regions, reducing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for image restoration often produce inconsistent fidelity and artifacts, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: KDS employs an N-particle ensemble to compute patch-wise kernel density gradients, steering samples toward shared high-density regions for better fidelity.

Result: KDS enhances both quantitative and qualitative performance in super-resolution and inpainting tasks without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: KDS offers a plug-and-play solution to improve diffusion models' robustness and fidelity in image restoration tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for image restoration, but existing methods
often struggle with inconsistent fidelity and undesirable artifacts. To address
this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time
framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local
mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples,
computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective
outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared,
higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local
mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from
spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model
imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows
us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by
simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS
requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with
various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS
substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on
challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenHMC, a generative method to create synthetic HMC images from dome captures, improving avatar animation accuracy and reducing reliance on paired datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in obtaining ground truth facial states for VR/AR avatars due to partial observations from HMC and the expense of paired data collection.

Method: Proposes GenHMC, leveraging unpaired HMC captures to generate synthetic HMC images conditioned on dome capture states, disentangling expression and appearance.

Result: Achieves accurate ground truth, generalizes to unseen identities, and improves data efficiency and accuracy in face encoders.

Conclusion: GenHMC offers a scalable solution for photorealistic avatar animations by reducing dependency on paired datasets and enhancing generalization.

Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality
(VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground
truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images
from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations
in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full
observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on
analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer
from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their
personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)
for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale
datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In
this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),
that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,
to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning
avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly
disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and
viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.
Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the
reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both
evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these
new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and
state-of-the-art accuracy.

*Suoxiang Zhang,Xiaxi Li,Hongrui Chang,Zhuoyan Hou,Guoxin Wu,Ronghua Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptaGen is a hierarchical semantic optimization framework for domain-specific image generation, addressing limitations like semantic deviations and hallucinations by integrating prompt optimization and cross-modal adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to integrate semantic understanding with visual representation and lack domain-specific constraints, leading to poor quality and semantic deviations.

Method: Proposes AdaptaGen with matrix-based prompt optimization, multi-perspective understanding, cross-modal adaptation, and two-phase caption semantic transformation.

Result: Achieves superior performance in image quality, diversity, and semantic consistency across 40 categories with minimal training data.

Conclusion: AdaptaGen effectively addresses domain-specific image generation challenges, ensuring semantic accuracy and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Domain-specific image generation aims to produce high-quality visual content
for specialized fields while ensuring semantic accuracy and detail fidelity.
However, existing methods exhibit two critical limitations: First, current
approaches address prompt engineering and model adaptation separately,
overlooking the inherent dependence between semantic understanding and visual
representation in specialized domains. Second, these techniques inadequately
incorporate domain-specific semantic constraints during content synthesis,
resulting in generation outcomes that exhibit hallucinations and semantic
deviations. To tackle these issues, we propose AdaptaGen, a hierarchical
semantic optimization framework that integrates matrix-based prompt
optimization with multi-perspective understanding, capturing comprehensive
semantic relationships from both global and local perspectives. To mitigate
hallucinations in specialized domains, we design a cross-modal adaptation
mechanism, which, when combined with intelligent content synthesis, enables
preserving core thematic elements while incorporating diverse details across
images. Additionally, we introduce a two-phase caption semantic transformation
during the generation phase. This approach maintains semantic coherence while
enhancing visual diversity, ensuring the generated images adhere to
domain-specific constraints. Experimental results confirm our approach's
effectiveness, with our framework achieving superior performance across 40
categories from diverse datasets using only 16 images per category,
demonstrating significant improvements in image quality, diversity, and
semantic consistency.

*Zhiwei Chen,Yupeng Hu,Zixu Li,Zhiheng Fu,Xuemeng Song,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OFFSET, a method for Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) that addresses feature degradation and visual focus bias by segmenting dominant portions and using text-guided focus revision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CIR is limited by ignoring inhomogeneity in visual data and overlooking textual priority, leading to degraded query features and visual focus bias.

Method: OFFSET includes a focus mapping-based feature extractor (dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping) and a textually guided focus revision module.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets show OFFSET's superiority.

Conclusion: OFFSET effectively improves CIR by addressing key limitations and enhancing feature extraction and focus revision.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is
capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It
enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a
modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding
the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its
nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and
noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation,
and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is
overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two
limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which
consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping.
It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide
the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact
of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus
revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the
text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby
enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features.
The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus
shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method. The

*Junfei Shi,Yu Cheng,Haiyan Jin,Junhuai Li,Zhaolin Xiao,Maoguo Gong,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion model in the Contourlet domain improves PolSAR image classification by preserving phase information and fine structural details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional real-valued diffusion models fail to capture complex-valued phase information and preserve fine structural details in PolSAR data.

Method: Uses Contourlet transform for multiscale/multidirectional representations, extracts statistical/boundary features, and guides diffusion with high-frequency structural information.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in edge detail preservation and region homogeneity on three PolSAR datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses limitations of traditional diffusion models for PolSAR data, enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various
domains due to their ability to model and generate complicated data
distributions. However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued
diffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase
information.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural
details. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform,
which provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited
for PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion
model for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain. Specifically,
the complex Contourlet transform is first applied to decompose the data into
low- and high-frequency subbands, enabling the extraction of statistical and
boundary features. A knowledge-guided complex diffusion network is then
designed to model the statistical properties of the low-frequency components.
During the process, structural information from high-frequency coefficients is
utilized to guide the diffusion process, improving edge preservation.
Furthermore, multiscale and multidirectional high-frequency features are
jointly learned to further boost classification accuracy. Experimental results
on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving edge details and
maintaining region homogeneity in complex terrain.

*Jiahui Wang,Qin Xu,Bo Jiang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a method to enhance generalization in vision-language models by dynamically adjusting feature importance during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for fine-tuning VLMs struggle with maintaining generalization for unseen classes due to equal treatment of all tokens, leading to overfitting on less informative features.

Method: DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on token importance, groups tokens by importance, and introduces a channel response mechanism and L1 regularization.

Result: DRA outperforms existing methods, improving performance on new classes across benchmarks like base-new classes, cross-datasets, and domain generalization.

Conclusion: DRA effectively preserves general knowledge and enhances generalization for novel concepts in VLMs.

Abstract: Pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP demonstrate
impressive generalization ability. Existing prompt-based and adapter-based
works have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the
challenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards
unseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating
all tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting
on less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and
degrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept
recognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a
novel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class
generalization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the
importance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first
employs token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and
group tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to
the importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature
ranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response
mechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels
identified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1
regularization term is introduced to stabilize the training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DRA
over existing works, especially on enhancing the performance of new classes on
various benchmarks, including base-new classes, cross-datasets evaluation and
domain generalization. The source code will be published after the paper is
received.

*Omar Zamzam,Haleh Akrami,Anand Joshi,Richard Leahy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion model-based framework is introduced to segment, reverse deformations, and inpaint brain lesions, improving accuracy in lesion analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lesion segmentation methods fail to distinguish between damaged and deformed brain tissue, limiting clinical and research applications.

Method: The framework segments lesions, reverses tissue deformations to isolate core damage, and inpaints to estimate pre-lesion healthy brain. A forward model simulates lesioned images for validation.

Result: Improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and brain labeling compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust tool for clinical and research applications by reversing lesion growth and estimating pre-lesion brain states.

Abstract: Brain lesions are abnormalities or injuries in brain tissue that are often
detectable using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals structural
changes in the affected areas. This broad definition of brain lesions includes
areas of the brain that are irreversibly damaged, as well as areas of brain
tissue that are deformed as a result of lesion growth or swelling. Despite the
importance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing
lesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as
a single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework
for analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process. Our pipeline first
segments abnormal regions in the brain, then estimates and reverses tissue
deformations by restoring displaced tissue to its original position, isolating
the core lesion area representing the initial damage. Finally, we inpaint the
core lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain.
This proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is
well-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results
demonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and
brain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for
clinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis. Since pre-lesion
healthy versions of abnormal brains are not available in any public dataset for
validation of the reverse process, we simulate a forward model to synthesize
multiple lesioned brain images.

Motivation: Existing GUI agents struggle with precise element grounding due to cluttered screenshots and ineffective loss functions.

Method: Introduces R-VLM, using zoomed-in region proposals and an IoU-aware objective for better localization.

Result: Achieves 13% higher grounding accuracy on benchmarks and 3.2-9.7% improvement in navigation tasks.

Conclusion: R-VLM bridges VLMs and object detection, significantly enhancing GUI automation accuracy.

Abstract: Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by
advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI
automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse
platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large
and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant
information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches
typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives,
which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established
object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these
issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages
zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an
IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU
predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object
detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13%
across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and
AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy
improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.

Motivation: Medical video generation is underexplored despite its importance for clinical training and education, with current models lacking accuracy due to insufficient datasets.

Method: The authors create MedVideoCap-55K, a dataset of 55,000 curated medical clips, and develop MedGen, a model trained on this dataset.

Result: MedGen outperforms open-source models and competes with commercial systems in visual quality and medical accuracy.

Conclusion: The dataset and model aim to advance medical video generation research and serve as a valuable resource.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in
open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely
underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical
training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity
but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce
unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due
to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical
domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first
large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It
comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios,
providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation
models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading
performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across
multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our
dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further
research in medical video generation. Our code and data is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve interaction between text and image branches, addressing structural relationships and balancing base/new class performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods for VLMs often overlook structural relationships between prompts and tokens, and struggle with balancing base and new class performance.

Method: ISP introduces self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model relationships within and across modalities, along with a sample probing module for dynamic loss adjustment.

Result: ISP achieves competitive performance in base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization tasks.

Conclusion: The ISP method enhances VLM performance by improving structural relationships and generalization, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream
tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide
text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works
ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within
and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new
classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an
Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of
information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces
self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural
relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across
modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving
feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that
dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing
the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization
ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings:
base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization
demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiON-LoRA improves video diffusion models by introducing linear scalability, orthogonality, and norm consistency for precise control over camera and object motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with unstable fusion and non-linear scalability in controlling camera trajectories and object motion in video diffusion models.

Method: LiON-LoRA analyzes orthogonality in shallow layers, enforces norm consistency, and integrates a controllable token in the diffusion transformer for linear adjustment of motion amplitudes.

Result: LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy and motion strength adjustment, with superior generalization using minimal data.

Conclusion: LiON-LoRA effectively addresses fusion and scalability challenges, enabling precise and decoupled control in video synthesis.

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing realistic videos by learning from large-scale data. Although
vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal
movement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over
both camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the
unstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose
LiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core
principles: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we
analyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling
decoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced
across layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.
Third, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)
to linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a
modified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we
extend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,
unifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that
LiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy
and motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal
training data. Project Page: https://fuchengsu.github.io/lionlora.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A sensor fusion approach combining RGB and event sensors improves spacecraft pose estimation under harsh lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based pose estimation faces challenges due to lighting artifacts. Event sensors offer resilience but have limitations like low resolution and noise.

Method: A RANSAC-based technique fuses RGB and event data, using a beam-splitter prism for alignment, with dropout uncertainty estimation for robustness.

Result: The method shows efficacy in challenging illumination conditions, supported by a real dataset.

Conclusion: The fusion approach leverages both sensor strengths, and the dataset will be publicly released to aid further research.

Abstract: Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations,
such as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose
estimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling
solution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting
conditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,
blooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic
or event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,
event sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced
signal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work
addresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion
approach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to
achieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique
was developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to
achieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The
pipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme
conditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the
proposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of
RGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under
a variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the
dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further
supports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation. To support
community research on this topic, our dataset will be released publicly.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis.
Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying
and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a
hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid
advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence,
military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant
progress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high
computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation
across diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of
various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,
representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep
learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets
using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to
analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths,
limitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep
learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical
models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to
provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance

### [94] [SenseShift6D: Multimodal RGB-D Benchmarking for Robust 6D Pose Estimation across Environment and Sensor Variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05751)
*Yegyu Han,Taegyoon Yoon,Dayeon Woo,Sojeong Kim,Hyung-Sin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SenseShift6D introduces a new RGB-D dataset to explore the impact of real-world sensor and lighting variations on 6D object-pose estimation, showing that test-time sensor control outperforms data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for 6D object-pose estimation lack real-world variations in illumination and sensor settings, limiting robustness in practical applications.

Method: The dataset captures 101.9k RGB and 10k depth images for three objects under 1,380 unique sensor-lighting permutations, testing state-of-the-art models with sensor control.

Result: Test-time sensor control improves performance more than data augmentation, with joint RGB-D adaptation yielding the best results.

Conclusion: SenseShift6D advances 6D-pose evaluation by emphasizing sensor-aware robustness, enabling adaptive perception systems for uncertain environments.

Abstract: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation has achieved high performance on
representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these
datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving
the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or
depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate
such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,
9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.
For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire
101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting
permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our
dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater
performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance
comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data
quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is
effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even
greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from
data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive,
self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain
real-world environments. Our dataset is available at:

TL;DR: An automatic white balance algorithm for microscopic images outperforms classical photography methods, validated on 200 images of pathomorphology specimens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate color balance in microscopy is challenging; this work aims to automate and improve it.

Method: An automatic white balance mechanism was developed and tested on 200 microscopic images, including hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron and immunohistochemical stains.

Result: The algorithm proved more effective than traditional white balance methods for microscopy.

Conclusion: The proposed automatic white balance solution is superior for microscopic images, especially in pathomorphology.

Abstract: The acquisition of accurately coloured, balanced images in an optical
microscope can be a challenge even for experienced microscope operators. This
article presents an entirely automatic mechanism for balancing the white level
that allows the correction of the microscopic colour images adequately. The
results of the algorithm have been confirmed experimentally on a set of two
hundred microscopic images. The images contained scans of three microscopic
specimens commonly used in pathomorphology. Also, the results achieved were
compared with other commonly used white balance algorithms in digital
photography. The algorithm applied in this work is more effective than the
classical algorithms used in colour photography for microscopic images stained
with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron and for immunohistochemical staining images.

*Ruijie Lu,Yu Liu,Jiaxiang Tang,Junfeng Ni,Yuxiang Wang,Diwen Wan,Gang Zeng,Yixin Chen,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamArt introduces a framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated 3D objects from single-view images, addressing gaps in part decomposition and articulation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation, while neural reconstruction approaches require dense data, limiting scalability.

Method: DreamArt uses a three-stage pipeline: reconstructing part-segmented 3D meshes, fine-tuning a video diffusion model for articulation priors, and optimizing motion and texture.

Result: DreamArt generates high-quality articulated objects with accurate part shapes, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation.

Conclusion: DreamArt provides a scalable solution for articulated asset generation, advancing applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR.

Abstract: Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial
yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR.
Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture,
neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural
reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense
multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we
introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,
interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a
three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D
object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D
segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video
diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable
part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by
occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by
a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to
ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results
demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated
objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and
plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated
asset generation. Our project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual try-on methods lack versatility and flexibility, focusing on single tasks. This paper aims to enable multifunctional try-on via text instructions.

Method: Proposes TalkFashion, leveraging large language models to interpret user instructions and activate task-specific pipelines. Introduces an instruction-based local repainting model for automated edits.

Result: Achieves better semantic consistency and visual quality than current methods.

Conclusion: TalkFashion enhances flexibility and automation in virtual try-on, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Virtual try-on has made significant progress in recent years. This paper
addresses how to achieve multifunctional virtual try-on guided solely by text
instructions, including full outfit change and local editing. Previous methods
primarily relied on end-to-end networks to perform single try-on tasks, lacking
versatility and flexibility. We propose TalkFashion, an intelligent try-on
assistant that leverages the powerful comprehension capabilities of large
language models to analyze user instructions and determine which task to
execute, thereby activating different processing pipelines accordingly.
Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that
eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks. With the help of
multi-modal models, this approach achieves fully automated local editings,
enhancing the flexibility of editing tasks. The experimental results
demonstrate better semantic consistency and visual quality compared to the
current methods.

*Xin Hu,Ke Qin,Guiduo Duan,Ming Li,Yuan-Fang Li,Tao He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPADE improves Panoptic Scene Graph Generation by addressing VLM limitations in spatial reasoning using a diffusion model and spatial-aware transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with spatial relation reasoning, leading to poor relation prediction in PSG.

Method: SPADE uses inversion-guided calibration and spatial-aware context reasoning to enhance relation understanding.

Result: SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in spatial relationship prediction.

Conclusion: SPADE effectively addresses spatial reasoning limitations in PSG, improving performance in open-vocabulary settings.

Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) integrates instance segmentation with
relation understanding to capture pixel-level structural relationships in
complex scenes. Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the
open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs
in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object
relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated
by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial
structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork)
framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two
key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2)
spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general
pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with
cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based
fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation
graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual
information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.
Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate
that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set
scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.

*Xin Li,Mingming Gong,Yunfei Wu,Jianxin Dai,Antai Guo,Xinghua Jiang,Haoyu Cao,Yinsong Liu,Deqiang Jiang,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DREAM, an autoregressive model for end-to-end document reconstruction, addressing limitations of multi-stage and generative models by preserving layout information and achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current document reconstruction methods suffer from error propagation in multi-stage approaches and lack layout preservation in generative models, necessitating a more comprehensive solution.

Method: The authors propose DREAM, an autoregressive model that converts text images into document sequences end-to-end, preserving layout and element information. They also define the task formally and introduce DSM and DocRec1K for evaluation.

Result: DREAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in document reconstruction and performs competitively in subtasks like layout analysis, text recognition, and formula recognition.

Conclusion: DREAM offers a robust, end-to-end solution for document reconstruction, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating versatility across subtasks.

Abstract: Document reconstruction constitutes a significant facet of document analysis
and recognition, a field that has been progressively accruing interest within
the scholarly community. A multitude of these researchers employ an array of
document understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks,
subsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction
format via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies
are hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to
extract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions
in an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the
information related to element layouts, which are vital for document
reconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper
present an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document
reconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end
Autoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence
of document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process,
encapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition,
we establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and
introduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for
assessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our
methodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document
reconstruction. Furthermore, the results on a variety of subtasks, encompassing
document layout analysis, text recognition, table structure recognition,
formula recognition and reading order detection, indicate that our model is
competitive and compatible with various tasks.

*Samed Doğan,Maximilian Hoh,Nico Leuze,Nicolas R. -Peña,Alfred Schöttl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generating synthetic camera sensor data for autonomous driving by introducing solar altitude as a global conditioning variable, reducing reliance on manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data acquisition for autonomous driving is costly and limited by safety and labeling constraints, creating a need for efficient synthetic data generation methods.

Method: The authors propose using solar altitude (derived from latitude, longitude, and time) as a conditioning variable and introduce a normalization approach to handle lighting variations in diffusion models.

Result: The method effectively captures lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent noise in synthetic data.

Conclusion: Solar altitude is a viable solution for reducing labeling effort in synthetic data generation, improving robustness for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily
dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data
acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors
such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage.
Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic
camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime
variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently,
we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily
computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the
need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored
normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small
numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture
lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context
of diffusion models.

TL;DR: A framework for generating synthetic 3D bridge point clouds with annotations and realistic incompleteness to improve segmentation and completion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses inefficiencies in manual bridge inspections and limitations of real-world 3D point cloud data due to missing labels and occlusions.

Method: Proposes a systematic framework to generate synthetic 3D bridge data with complete point clouds, annotations, and realistic incompleteness.

Result: Achieves 84.2% mIoU in real-world bridge segmentation and superior performance in component completion using synthetic data.

Conclusion: Provides a novel methodology and dataset for 3D bridge analysis, enhancing automated infrastructure management.

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges
from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods
suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new
data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the
incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and
scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization
in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework
for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring
component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal
vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and
physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training
of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate
that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic
segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance
on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for
the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications
for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for 2D image editing lack consistency and object identity preservation due to pixel-level manipulations.

Method: The proposed "2D-3D-2D" framework lifts 2D objects into 3D, edits them in a physically plausible 3D space, and reprojects them back into 2D.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods like DragGAN and DragDiffusion, ensuring consistent edits and robust identity preservation.

Conclusion: The "2D-3D-2D" approach effectively addresses limitations of 2D editing by incorporating 3D manipulation, enhancing realism and consistency.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved significant progress in advancing 2D image
editing, demonstrating exceptional precision and realism. However, they often
struggle with consistency and object identity preservation due to their
inherent pixel-manipulation nature. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel "2D-3D-2D" framework. Our approach begins by lifting 2D objects into 3D
representation, enabling edits within a physically plausible,
rigidity-constrained 3D environment. The edited 3D objects are then reprojected
and seamlessly inpainted back into the original 2D image. In contrast to
existing 2D editing methods, such as DragGAN and DragDiffusion, our method
directly manipulates objects in a 3D environment. Extensive experiments
highlight that our framework surpasses previous methods in general performance,
delivering highly consistent edits while robustly preserving object identity.

TL;DR: A novel framework combines Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance video understanding, enabling advanced reasoning and prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video models lack commonsense knowledge for high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future prediction.

Method: The framework fuses a VFM for visual perception with an LLM for reasoning, using a Q-Former-inspired fusion module to align visual features with language. Training involves large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning on reasoning-focused datasets.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, with strong zero-shot generalization and validated contributions of each component.

Conclusion: The work advances machine perception from recognition to cognitive understanding, benefiting AI applications in robotics and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening
but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future
prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge.
To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically
fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with
a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our
key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the
Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric
visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables
the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual
evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with
large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted
instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced
reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks.
Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning
tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of
each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine
perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding,
paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces I²R, a novel few-shot segmentation method addressing inter- and intra-image discrepancies to improve segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation and limitations of current few-shot segmentation methods, such as semantic gaps and visually similar yet distinct regions, drive the need for better solutions.

Method: I²R uses category-specific high-level representations for precise inter-image region localization and a directional masking strategy to suppress inconsistent pixel pairs.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 1.9% and 2.1% mIoU improvements on PASCAL-5ⁱ and COCO-20ⁱ benchmarks under 1-shot settings.

Conclusion: I²R effectively addresses key limitations in few-shot segmentation, demonstrating superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: The annotation bottleneck in semantic segmentation has driven significant
interest in few-shot segmentation, which aims to develop segmentation models
capable of generalizing rapidly to novel classes using minimal exemplars.
Conventional training paradigms typically generate query prior maps by
extracting masked-area features from support images, followed by making
predictions guided by these prior maps. However, current approaches remain
constrained by two critical limitations stemming from inter- and intra-image
discrepancies, both of which significantly degrade segmentation performance: 1)
The semantic gap between support and query images results in mismatched
features and inaccurate prior maps; 2) Visually similar yet semantically
distinct regions within support or query images lead to false negative or false
positive predictions. We propose a novel FSS method called \textbf{I$^2$R}: 1)
Using category-specific high level representations which aggregate global
semantic cues from support and query images, enabling more precise inter-image
region localization and address the first limitation. 2) Directional masking
strategy that suppresses inconsistent support-query pixel pairs, which exhibit
high feature similarity but conflicting mask, to mitigate the second issue.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving improvements of 1.9\% and 2.1\% in mIoU under the 1-shot
setting on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ benchmarks, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USIGAN, a novel method for IHC virtual staining, addresses spatial heterogeneity in weakly paired conditions by leveraging unbalanced self-information feature transport, improving pathological semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of spatial heterogeneity in weakly paired conditions for IHC virtual staining leads to inaccurate mappings and inconsistent results, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: USIGAN uses unbalanced self-information feature transport, UOT-CTM, and PC-SCM mechanisms to mitigate weak pairing effects and enhance consistency.

Result: Superior performance on clinical metrics (IoD, Pearson-R) across two datasets, demonstrating better clinical relevance.

Conclusion: USIGAN effectively improves pathological semantic consistency and content accuracy in IHC virtual staining under weakly paired conditions.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) virtual staining is a task that generates virtual
IHC images from H\&E images while maintaining pathological semantic consistency
with adjacent slices. This task aims to achieve cross-domain mapping between
morphological structures and staining patterns through generative models,
providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for pathological analysis.
However, under weakly paired conditions, spatial heterogeneity between adjacent
slices presents significant challenges. This can lead to inaccurate one-to-many
mappings and generate results that are inconsistent with the pathological
semantics of adjacent slices. To address this issue, we propose a novel
unbalanced self-information feature transport for IHC virtual staining, named
USIGAN, which extracts global morphological semantics without relying on
positional correspondence.By removing weakly paired terms in the joint marginal
distribution, we effectively mitigate the impact of weak pairing on joint
distributions, thereby significantly improving the content consistency and
pathological semantic consistency of the generated results. Moreover, we design
the Unbalanced Optimal Transport Consistency (UOT-CTM) mechanism and the
Pathology Self-Correspondence (PC-SCM) mechanism to construct correlation
matrices between H\&E and generated IHC in image-level and real IHC and
generated IHC image sets in intra-group level.. Experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance across multiple clinically significant metrics, such as IoD and
Pearson-R correlation, demonstrating better clinical relevance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for remote sensing-based crop yield prediction struggle with limited spatial modeling and weak generalization across crop types and years.

Method: DFYP includes three components: Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA), Adaptive Operator Learning Network (AOL-Net), and a dual-branch architecture with learnable fusion.

Result: DFYP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different resolutions, crop types, and time periods.

Conclusion: DFYP is effective and robust for real-world agricultural monitoring, demonstrating superior performance in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate remote sensing-based crop yield prediction remains a fundamental
challenging task due to complex spatial patterns, heterogeneous spectral
characteristics, and dynamic agricultural conditions. Existing methods often
suffer from limited spatial modeling capacity, weak generalization across crop
types and years. To address these challenges, we propose DFYP, a novel Dynamic
Fusion framework for crop Yield Prediction, which combines spectral channel
attention, edge-adaptive spatial modeling and a learnable fusion mechanism to
improve robustness across diverse agricultural scenarios. Specifically, DFYP
introduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA)
module that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input
channels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator
Learning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional
kernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop
and temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable
fusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global
contextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop
generalization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and
multi-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different
spatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness
and robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-FCGS introduces a feedforward framework for compressing dynamic Gaussian Splatting sequences, using GoF structure and dual prior-aware entropy for efficient rate-distortion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient compression of dynamic 3D representations like Free-viewpoint video (FVV) is challenging, and existing methods lack generalizability due to coupling reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding.

Method: The framework uses Group-of-Frames (GoF) with I-P frame coding, extracts inter-frame motions via sparse control points, and compresses motion tensors with a dual prior-aware entropy model. Reconstruction involves motion compensation and refinement.

Result: D-FCGS achieves over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds, matching optimization-based methods in rate-distortion performance while preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: D-FCGS advances feedforward compression for dynamic 3DGS, enabling scalable FVV transmission and storage for immersive applications.

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient
compression of dynamic 3D representations remains a major challenge. Recent
advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have
enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple
scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits
generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic
Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing
temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a
Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame
motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors
are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model
that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate
estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion
compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent
fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS
generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that
it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods,
achieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual
quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for
dynamic 3DGS, paving the way for scalable FVV transmission and storage in
immersive applications.

*Xianzhi Ma,Jianhui Li,Changhua Pei,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoMag is a new framework for remote sensing image understanding, addressing limitations of existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by dynamically adjusting attention and resolution for multi-granularity tasks, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RS-VLMs struggle with pixel-level tasks, small-object recognition, and high computational costs for high-resolution images, limiting their practicality.

Method: GeoMag introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC) to adaptively focus on relevant regions, reducing redundancy and computational costs.

Result: GeoMag outperforms existing RS-VLMs on 10 benchmarks, excelling in pixel-level tasks while maintaining performance across other granularities.

Conclusion: GeoMag is a versatile and efficient solution for remote sensing image parsing, overcoming key limitations of current RS-VLMs.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) image
understanding has achieved notable progress, demonstrating the basic ability to
recognize and describe geographical entities. However, existing RS-VLMs are
mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to
handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition
scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when
processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical
applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an
end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically
focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform
remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method
introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and
Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the
spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual
representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's
perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and
reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery.
Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not
only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive
performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.

*Yuedong Tan,Jiawei Shao,Eduard Zamfir,Ruanjun Li,Zhaochong An,Chao Ma,Danda Paudel,Luc Van Gool,Radu Timofte,Zongwei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking, addressing performance degradation in existing trackers due to temporally incomplete multimodal data. The proposed method dynamically adapts to missing modalities and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trackers struggle with temporally incomplete multimodal data due to rigid architectures, leading to performance degradation. This paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes a flexible framework with a Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion mechanism and video-level masking for adaptive handling of missing modalities.

Result: The model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks, adapting to varying missing rates and scene complexity.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles missing modalities, outperforming existing trackers in both complete and incomplete data settings.

Abstract: Multimodal data is known to be helpful for visual tracking by improving
robustness to appearance variations. However, sensor synchronization challenges
often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where
shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on
tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly,
under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance
degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to
effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker
should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates.
This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion
mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy
that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is
critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts
to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive
experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks,
excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code
and benchmark will be publicly available at

*Jonas Klotz,Tom Burgert,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the suitability of explainable AI (xAI) methods and metrics for remote sensing (RS) scene classification, identifying limitations and providing guidelines for method and metric selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most xAI methods and metrics are developed for natural images in computer vision, and their direct application to RS may not be appropriate. This study investigates their effectiveness in RS.

Method: Analyzes ten explanation metrics across five categories, applied to five feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, DeepLIFT) on three RS datasets.

Result: Identifies limitations in methods (e.g., perturbation-based methods depend on baselines, gradient-based struggle with multi-label images) and metrics (e.g., localization metrics unreliable for large classes). Robustness and randomization metrics are more stable.

Conclusion: Provides guidelines for selecting xAI methods, metrics, and hyperparameters tailored to RS scene classification.

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for
scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing
(RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially
developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their
direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,
we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the
context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and
experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories
(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to
five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,
and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies
key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of
perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on
perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based
approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same
image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance
disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we
find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same
problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity
metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,
robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater
stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings.
Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods,
metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

*Xinyu Huang,Yuhao Dong,Weiwei Tian,Bo Li,Rui Feng,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGPO is an RL framework for LMMs to iteratively focus on key visual regions via multi-turn grounding, outperforming SFT and other models on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs struggle with high-resolution images due to irrelevant visual tokens; MGPO aims to improve grounding without costly annotations.

Method: Uses RL with a binary reward function, multi-turn conversational templates, and policy loss computation to stabilize training.

Result: MGPO improves performance by 5.4% on MME-Realworld and 5.2% on V* Bench, surpassing GPT-4o on OOD tasks.

Conclusion: MGPO effectively enhances LMM grounding capabilities without additional annotations, demonstrating strong performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art large multi-modal models (LMMs) face challenges when
processing high-resolution images, as these inputs are converted into enormous
visual tokens, many of which are irrelevant to the downstream task. In this
paper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to
iteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,
based on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation
framework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly
additional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge
robust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a
binary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.
Additionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual
grounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we
design a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss
computation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby
promoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when
trained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding
annotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared
to GRPO, leading to 5.4\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and
5.2\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.
Notably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses
OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench. Codes are available at

*Quanzhu Niu,Yikang Zhou,Shihao Chen,Tao Zhang,Shunping Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces geometric awareness via monocular depth estimation to improve Video Instance Segmentation (VIS), addressing challenges like occlusions and motion blur. Three integration methods are tested, with EDC and SV showing significant robustness improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VIS struggles with occlusions, motion blur, and appearance changes. The work aims to enhance VIS robustness by incorporating depth cues.

Method: Three paradigms are explored: Expanding Depth Channel (EDC), Sharing ViT (SV), and Depth Supervision (DS). EDC adds depth maps as input, SV shares a ViT backbone, and DS uses depth prediction for feature learning.

Result: EDC and SV notably improve VIS robustness. EDC with Swin-L backbone achieves 56.2 AP, setting a new state-of-the-art on OVIS.

Conclusion: Depth cues are critical for robust video understanding, with EDC and SV proving effective.

Abstract: Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive
challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations
during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work
introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically
leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three
distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method
concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing
ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and
segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as
an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited
effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly
enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets
56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work
conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video
understanding.

*Aoxiang Fan,Corentin Dumery,Nicolas Talabot,Hieu Le,Pascal Fua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A sparse representation method for neural surface reconstruction improves memory efficiency and enables higher resolution reconstructions without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense 3D feature volumes limit reconstruction quality due to poor scalability with increasing voxel resolutions.

Method: A two-stage approach: predict voxel occupancies from images and depth maps, then compute features and render only in high-occupancy voxels. Custom algorithms handle sparse volumes efficiently.

Result: Reduces storage by 50x, enables 512^3 resolution (vs. 128^3), and achieves superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The sparse representation method significantly enhances reconstruction quality and efficiency, outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: Generalizable neural surface reconstruction has become a compelling technique
to reconstruct from few images without per-scene optimization, where dense 3D
feature volume has proven effective as a global representation of scenes.
However, the dense representation does not scale well to increasing voxel
resolutions, severely limiting the reconstruction quality. We thus present a
sparse representation method, that maximizes memory efficiency and enables
significantly higher resolution reconstructions on standard hardware. We
implement this through a two-stage approach: First training a network to
predict voxel occupancies from posed images and associated depth maps, then
computing features and performing volume rendering only in voxels with
sufficiently high occupancy estimates. To support this sparse representation,
we developed custom algorithms for efficient sampling, feature aggregation, and
querying from sparse volumes-overcoming the dense-volume assumptions inherent
in existing works. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach
reduces storage requirements by more than 50 times without performance
degradation, enabling reconstructions at $512^3$ resolution compared to the
typical $128^3$ on similar hardware, and achieving superior reconstruction
accuracy over current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Tora2 enhances Tora with improved appearance and motion customization, introducing a decoupled personalization extractor, gated self-attention, and contrastive loss for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance motion-guided video generation by enabling simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion.

Method: Introduces a decoupled personalization extractor, gated self-attention mechanism, and contrastive loss for joint optimization.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods and advanced motion control.

Conclusion: Tora2 marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformer models for motion-guided video
generation, such as Tora, have shown significant progress. In this paper, we
present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design
improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion
customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor
that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set
entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous
methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to
integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each
entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal
conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that
jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit
mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best
knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization
of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate
that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization
methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a
critical advancement in multi-condition video generation. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-LoRA introduces a timestep-dependent low-rank adaptation framework for fine-tuning diffusion models with limited data, addressing overfitting and improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting in diffusion model fine-tuning with limited samples compromises generalization and diversity. Single-image customization is highly practical but challenging.

Method: T-LoRA uses a dynamic fine-tuning strategy adjusting rank-constrained updates by timestep and a weight parametrization technique with orthogonal initialization.

Result: T-LoRA outperforms standard LoRA and other methods, balancing concept fidelity and text alignment better.

Conclusion: T-LoRA is effective for data-limited scenarios, offering improved performance and potential for practical applications.

Abstract: While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing
pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from
overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization
capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most
impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image,
as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We
introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework
specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. In our work we show
that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones,
necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates
two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts
rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight
parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components
through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments show that T-LoRA and
its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model
personalization techniques. They achieve a superior balance between concept
fidelity and text alignment, highlighting the potential of T-LoRA in
data-limited and resource-constrained scenarios. Code is available at

*Haiwen Li,Delong Liu,Zhaohui Hou,Zhicheng Zhao,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable pipeline for automatic triplet generation and a synthetic dataset (CIRHS) to improve Composed Image Retrieval (CIR). It introduces Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a framework for robust CIR, achieving strong zero-shot and supervised performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods rely on costly manual triplet labeling, limiting scalability and zero-shot capability. The goal is to automate triplet generation and enhance CIR performance.

Method: The pipeline uses a large language model (LLM) to generate prompts for a text-to-image model, creating image pairs for the CIRHS dataset. CoAlign combines global alignment and local reasoning for robust CIR.

Result: CoAlign achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on benchmarks and outperforms state-of-the-art supervised CIR methods.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility of training CIR models on synthetic data and validates the effectiveness of CoAlign.

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR)
aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although
many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance
on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot
capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic
triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image
Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a
large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a
text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements
in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS
dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a
novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning
within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and
informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign
achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks,
demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a
fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method
outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the
effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS
dataset will be released soon.

TL;DR: SCINet is a novel framework for partial multi-label learning, leveraging multimodal models and semantic augmentation to improve label-instance relationships, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ambiguous label-instance relationships in incompletely annotated data by focusing on co-occurrence patterns.

Method: Proposes SCINet with a bi-dominant prompter module for text-image correlation, cross-modality fusion for interdependencies, and semantic augmentation for data understanding.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SCINet effectively tackles partial multi-label learning by enhancing semantic alignment and interdependencies, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely
annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels,
and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the
ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we
emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is
key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic
Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for
partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant
prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture
text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce
instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module
that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and
co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose
an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's
understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image
transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label
confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the performance drop of deepfake detection models on out-of-distribution data.

Method: Combining prediction probabilities from state-of-the-art asymmetric models in an ensemble framework.

Result: Ensemble predictions provide stable and reliable performance across diverse datasets, unlike single models.

Conclusion: Asymmetric ensembling is a robust and scalable solution for real-world deepfake detection.

Abstract: Machine learning-based Deepfake detection models have achieved impressive
results on benchmark datasets, yet their performance often deteriorates
significantly when evaluated on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we
investigate an ensemble-based approach for improving the generalization of
deepfake detection systems across diverse datasets. Building on a recent
open-source benchmark, we combine prediction probabilities from several
state-of-the-art asymmetric models proposed at top venues. Our experiments span
two distinct out-of-domain datasets and demonstrate that no single model
consistently outperforms others across settings. In contrast, ensemble-based
predictions provide more stable and reliable performance in all scenarios. Our
results suggest that asymmetric ensembling offers a robust and scalable
solution for real-world deepfake detection where prior knowledge of forgery

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for geo-registering LiDAR point clouds in GNSS-denied urban areas by aligning them with satellite images, improving accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNSS/IMU-based methods fail in dense urban areas due to signal denial and unstable positioning, necessitating a reliable alternative.

Method: Uses a Point Transformer model to segment roads, extracts road skeletons and intersection points, aligns them globally and refines locally with RBF interpolation, and corrects elevation using SRTM data.

Result: Achieved 55.3% and 77.4% planimetric alignment improvements on KITTI and Perth datasets, respectively, with notable elevation correlation gains.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses GNSS-denied geo-registration challenges, offering robust alignment and elevation correction for urban 3D mapping.

Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant
challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and
bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that
require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.
However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in
localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration
and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite
images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of
city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach
employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and
then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as
well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is
performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied
to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve
vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI
benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the
KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard
deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a
55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks
GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the
GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\%
improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation
correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth
dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCDA improves text rendering in diffusion models by integrating glyph conditioning and character-aware attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance in readability and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models struggle with generating readable and correctly spelled text, limiting practical applications.

Method: GCDA extends diffusion models with a dual-stream text encoder, character-aware attention, and OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning.

Result: GCDA outperforms benchmarks in text rendering (lower error rates) and maintains high image fidelity (FID: 14.3).

Conclusion: GCDA addresses text rendering limitations in diffusion models, enabling practical use in advertising, learning, and design.

Abstract: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in
digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to
produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics
of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these
models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled
text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical
purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces
a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware
Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three
well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder
that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph
representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input
text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of
the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to
limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to
avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning
phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be
legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,
such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new
state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text
rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error
Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality
on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

TL;DR: VisualSpeaker improves 3D facial animation using photorealistic rendering and perceptual lip-reading loss, outperforming prior methods by 56.1% in Lip Vertex Error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity 3D facial animations are needed for expressive avatars, but mesh-based methods lag behind 2D innovations.

Method: Uses photorealistic differentiable rendering supervised by visual speech recognition, with a perceptual lip-reading loss derived from 3D Gaussian Splatting and a pre-trained VASR model.

Result: Achieves 56.1% improvement in Lip Vertex Error and better perceptual quality on the MEAD dataset.

Conclusion: VisualSpeaker enhances 3D facial animation quality and controllability, particularly benefiting sign language avatars.

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive
avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior
methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their
ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer
vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this
gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech
recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual
lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting
avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model
during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker
improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual
quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of
mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate
mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign
language avatars.

Conclusion: MEDTalk advances emotional facial animation by enabling independent control and realistic, personalized expressions.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation aims to generate synchronized lip
movements and vivid facial expressions. However, most existing approaches focus
on static and predefined emotion labels, limiting their diversity and
naturalness. To address these challenges, we propose MEDTalk, a novel framework
for fine-grained and dynamic emotional talking head generation. Our approach
first disentangles content and emotion embedding spaces from motion sequences
using a carefully designed cross-reconstruction process, enabling independent
control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional
audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text,
predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static
emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to
enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including
text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of
user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our
generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production
pipeline.

*Tongtong Cheng,Rongzhen Li,Yixin Xiong,Tao Zhang,Jing Wang,Kai Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCAM is a novel model for autonomous driving video understanding, addressing shallow causality and spurious correlations by using multimodal causal analysis with DAGs and vision-language transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for driving behavior recognition lack deep causality modeling and fail to handle spurious correlations across modalities.

Method: MCAM uses a multi-level feature extractor, a causal analysis module with DAGs, and a vision-language transformer for feature alignment.

Result: MCAM achieves SOTA performance on BDD-X and CoVLA datasets, excelling in causal relationship learning and video sequence analysis.

Conclusion: MCAM effectively addresses limitations in existing methods, proving robust for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior recognition and reasoning are critical for
autonomous driving video understanding. However, existing methods often tend to
dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across
modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM)
that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language
modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture
long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that
dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align
critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions.
Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM
achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning.
Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal
characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for
autonomous driving applications. The code is available at

*Francesco Milano,Manuel López-Antequera,Naina Dhingra,Roland Siegwart,Robert Thiel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for 3D surface recovery from normal maps, explicitly handling depth discontinuities and supporting generic central cameras, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normal integration methods inadequately address depth discontinuities and are limited to specific camera models, necessitating a more versatile and accurate approach.

Method: The proposed method uses a local planarity assumption, modeling constraints between surface normals and ray directions to improve accuracy and handle generic central cameras.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and is the first to directly support generic central camera models.

Conclusion: This method advances normal integration by explicitly addressing discontinuities and broadening applicability to diverse camera models.

Abstract: Recovering a 3D surface from its surface normal map, a problem known as
normal integration, is a key component for photometric shape reconstruction
techniques such as shape-from-shading and photometric stereo. The vast majority
of existing approaches for normal integration handle only implicitly the
presence of depth discontinuities and are limited to orthographic or ideal
pinhole cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that allows
modeling discontinuities explicitly and handling generic central cameras. Our
key idea is based on a local planarity assumption, that we model through
constraints between surface normals and ray directions. Compared to existing
methods, our approach more accurately approximates the relation between depth
and surface normals, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal
integration benchmark, and is the first to directly handle generic central
camera models.

### [125] [ScoreAdv: Score-based Targeted Generation of Natural Adversarial Examples via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06078)
*Chihan Huang,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScoreAdv introduces a diffusion model-based method for generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs) with high success rates and image quality, outperforming GANs and other diffusion-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing methods often rely on unnatural perturbation constraints. The goal is to generate more natural UAEs that align with human perception.

Method: ScoreAdv uses an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism and saliency maps to shift the sampling distribution toward adversarial examples, leveraging diffusion models' denoising capabilities.

Result: ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, attacking both classification and retrieval models.

Conclusion: ScoreAdv demonstrates robust performance under defensive measures, offering a dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation for effective UAE generation.

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack
methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm
perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual
capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward
generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based
approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to
instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed
for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation
injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on
diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable
adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution
towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map
to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated
samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of
natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but
also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA
datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in
both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore,
the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables
ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.

*Joaquim Comas,Alexander Joel Vera,Xavier Vives,Eleonora De Filippi,Alexandre Pereda,Federico Sukno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAST-Phys, a dataset for remote multi-modal emotion recognition, addressing the lack of contactless affective datasets and the limitations of contact-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of non-invasive, multi-modal datasets for emotion recognition and the influence of contact-based devices on genuine emotional responses motivate the creation of CAST-Phys.

Method: The authors developed CAST-Phys, a dataset combining facial videos and physiological signals (PPG, EDA, RR) for remote emotion recognition, and evaluated modality fusion.

Result: The dataset enables remote signal recovery and demonstrates the importance of physiological signals when facial expressions are insufficient for emotion recognition.

Conclusion: CAST-Phys advances contactless emotion recognition by validating the effectiveness of multi-modal fusion in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, affective computing and its applications have become a
fast-growing research topic. Despite significant advancements, the lack of
affective multi-modal datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing
accurate emotion recognition systems. Furthermore, the use of contact-based
devices during emotion elicitation often unintentionally influences the
emotional experience, reducing or altering the genuine spontaneous emotional
response. This limitation highlights the need for methods capable of extracting
affective cues from multiple modalities without physical contact, such as
remote physiological emotion recognition. To address this, we present the
Contactless Affective States Through Physiological Signals Database
(CAST-Phys), a novel high-quality dataset explicitly designed for multi-modal
remote physiological emotion recognition using facial and physiological cues.
The dataset includes diverse physiological signals, such as
photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and respiration rate
(RR), alongside high-resolution uncompressed facial video recordings, enabling
the potential for remote signal recovery. Our analysis highlights the crucial
role of physiological signals in realistic scenarios where facial expressions
alone may not provide sufficient emotional information. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the potential of remote multi-modal emotion recognition by
evaluating the impact of individual and fused modalities, showcasing its
effectiveness in advancing contactless emotion recognition technologies.

*Jiayi Song,Zihan Ye,Qingyuan Zhou,Weidong Yang,Ben Fei,Jingyi Xu,Ying He,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ref-Unlock is a geometry-aware reflection modeling framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting to disentangle reflections from geometry, improving scene rendering accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NeRF and 3DGS misinterpret reflections as geometry, causing degraded reconstructions. Ref-Unlock aims to address this by explicitly modeling reflections.

Method: Uses a dual-branch representation with spherical harmonics for reflection details, a reflection removal module, pseudo-depth maps, and geometry-aware constraints.

Result: Outperforms GS-based methods and competes with NeRF models, enabling flexible reflection editing.

Conclusion: Ref-Unlock provides an efficient, generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes.

Abstract: Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant
challenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections
as physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods
rely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to
misalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene
geometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the
accumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in
blurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose
Ref-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected
components to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric
consistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch
representation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency
reflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo
reflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we
incorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness
constraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms
classical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with
NeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)
driven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and
generalizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code

TL;DR: Omni-Video is a unified framework for video understanding, generation, and editing, leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and diffusion decoders with lightweight architecture and efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundational models focus on images, leaving a gap in unified video understanding and generation. Omni-Video aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The framework integrates MLLMs to produce visual clues for diffusion decoders, using a lightweight architecture and multi-stage training.

Result: The model shows strong generalization across video generation, editing, and understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Omni-Video successfully unifies video tasks, demonstrating efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Notable breakthroughs in unified understanding and generation modeling have
led to remarkable advancements in image understanding, reasoning, production
and editing, yet current foundational models predominantly focus on processing
images, creating a gap in the development of unified models for video
understanding and generation. This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and
effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as
instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used
as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos
conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system
for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a
lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on
the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the
former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens
to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage
training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion
decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically
demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities
across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.

*Haoyu Wang,Lei Zhang,Wei Wei,Chen Ding,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image augmentation addresses text-condition deviation and lack of diversity by using local-global semantic fusion and LoRA knowledge injection, with a counting loss for improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-object image generation either deviate from original data due to text reliance or lack diversity from over-reliance on original images, limiting downstream task utility.

Method: Proposes a local-global semantic fusion strategy to replace text, injects knowledge via LoRA, and uses a counting loss alongside reconstruction loss for training.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, showing strong downstream task gains and out-of-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates deviation and diversity issues, enhancing dataset augmentation for computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation
in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating
multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely
entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated
objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images,
resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited
help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose
a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image
augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion
strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge
into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation
between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a
reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss
for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead
of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the
generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the
generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and
showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization
capabilities. Code is available at

consisting of two convolutional layers, max pooling, and fully connected layers
was implemented. SoftReMish was evaluated against popular activation functions
including ReLU, Tanh, and Mish by replacing the activation function in all

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a class of smoothing operators for irregular data, normalized to mimic Laplacian properties using a symmetric Sinkhorn algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing smoothing methods rely on structured domains or simple kernels, which are biased and lack theoretical guarantees for irregular data.

Method: Proposes a symmetric Sinkhorn algorithm to normalize general similarity/adjacency matrices into diffusion-like operators, retaining Laplacian properties.

Result: Operators approximate heat diffusion and preserve spectral information, applicable to irregular data like point clouds or sparse grids.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between Laplacian-based smoothing and practical, irregular data processing, with applications in shape analysis.

Abstract: Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in
machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as
vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential
geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with
strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a
carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most
practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing
layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this
gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general
similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized
into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from
Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn
algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural
behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing
and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or
mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate
heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself,
with applications to shape analysis and matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative methods produce monolithic 3D shapes, limiting utility for interactive applications requiring editable part structures.

Method: OmniPart uses an autoregressive structure planning module for part bounding boxes and a spatially-conditioned rectified flow model for part synthesis.

Result: OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting user-defined part granularity and precise localization.

Conclusion: OmniPart advances interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D content generation.

Abstract: The creation of 3D assets with explicit, editable part structures is crucial
for advancing interactive applications, yet most generative methods produce
only monolithic shapes, limiting their utility. We introduce OmniPart, a novel
framework for part-aware 3D object generation designed to achieve high semantic
decoupling among components while maintaining robust structural cohesion.
OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1)
an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable,
variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by
flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition
without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a
spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a
pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and
consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part
granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in visual question answering (VQA) for scientific data, presenting an approach for SciVQA 2025 using large models and ensemble techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA methods lack precision in interpreting scientific figures, especially for numerical values and multi-step reasoning.

Method: Experiments with 5B to 8B parameter models, including InternVL3 and ensemble VLMs, using prompt optimization and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: InternVL3 achieved ROUGE-1/L F1 scores of 0.740 and BERTScore of 0.983; ensemble models improved performance but InternVL3 was the strongest standalone.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning, and ensemble modeling enhance VQA performance for scientific figures.

Abstract: Technical reports and articles often contain valuable information in the form
of semi-structured data like charts, and figures. Interpreting these and using
the information from them is essential for downstream tasks such as question
answering (QA). Current approaches to visual question answering often struggle
with the precision required for scientific data interpretation, particularly in
handling numerical values, multi-step reasoning over visual elements, and
maintaining consistency between visual observation and textual reasoning. We
present our approach to the SciVQA 2025 shared task, focusing on answering
visual and non-visual questions grounded in scientific figures from scholarly
articles.
  We conducted a series of experiments using models with 5B to 8B parameters.
Our strongest individual model, InternVL3, achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L F1
scores of \textbf{0.740} and a BERTScore of \textbf{0.983} on the SciVQA test
split. We also developed an ensemble model with multiple vision language models
(VLMs). Through error analysis on the validation split, our ensemble approach
improved performance compared to most individual models, though InternVL3
remained the strongest standalone performer. Our findings underscore the
effectiveness of prompt optimization, chain-of-thought reasoning and ensemble

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CultureCLIP, a fine-tuned version of CLIP, to address its limitations in distinguishing culturally distinct but visually similar concepts. It uses a synthetic dataset, CulTwin, and customized contrastive learning to improve fine-grained cultural recognition while maintaining generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like CLIP struggle with fine-grained cultural distinctions due to lack of culture-specific datasets and contextual knowledge.

Method: A synthetic dataset (CulTwin) is created using VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models. CLIP is fine-tuned on this dataset with customized contrastive learning to create CultureCLIP.

Result: CultureCLIP outperforms CLIP by up to 5.49% in fine-grained cultural recognition tasks while preserving generalization.

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures subtle cultural distinctions, validating the data synthesis and training paradigm.

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal
understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual
features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally
distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality
culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the
absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these
challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages
open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a
synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired
concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but
represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to
create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced
captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling
finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.
Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms
the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained
concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original
generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and
VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

TL;DR: SceneDINO introduces an unsupervised method for semantic scene completion (SSC) using self-supervised learning and multi-view consistency, achieving state-of-the-art results without ground-truth annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior SSC methods rely on expensive ground-truth annotations; SceneDINO aims to eliminate this dependency by leveraging unsupervised techniques.

Method: SceneDINO adapts self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding to SSC, using multi-view consistency self-supervision and a novel 3D feature distillation approach.

Result: SceneDINO achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy in 3D and 2D unsupervised scene understanding, matching supervised SSC performance via linear probing.

Conclusion: SceneDINO advances unsupervised SSC, demonstrating strong domain generalization and multi-view consistency, paving the way for single-image 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to infer both the 3D geometry and
semantics of a scene from single images. In contrast to prior work on SSC that
heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an
unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from
self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding
to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency
self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given
a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO
features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation
approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised
scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.
Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current
supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization
and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a
strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.

### [137] [RSRefSeg 2: Decoupling Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation with Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06231)
*Keyan Chen,Chenyang Liu,Bowen Chen,Jiafan Zhang,Zhengxia Zou,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSRefSeg 2 is a decoupling paradigm for remote sensing image segmentation, improving accuracy and semantic interpretation by separating coarse localization and fine segmentation using CLIP and SAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with complex semantic relationships and cross-modal alignment due to coupled processing, limiting generalizability and interpretability.

Method: RSRefSeg 2 uses a dual-stage framework: CLIP for coarse localization and SAM for fine segmentation, with a cascaded second-order prompter to enhance precision.

Result: Outperforms contemporary methods by ~3% gIoU in segmentation accuracy and handles complex semantics better.

Conclusion: The decoupling approach with foundation model collaboration (CLIP + SAM) significantly improves remote sensing image segmentation.

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation provides a flexible and
fine-grained framework for remote sensing scene analysis via vision-language
collaborative interpretation. Current approaches predominantly utilize a
three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,
and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in
managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal
alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates
target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling
amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model
generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose
RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow
into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine
segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with
SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model
collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to
activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate
localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in
multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order
prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via
decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These
optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level
refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive
experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2
surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex

*Inès Hyeonsu Kim,Seokju Cho,Jahyeok Koo,Junghyun Park,Jiahui Huang,Joon-Young Lee,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnthroTAP automates pseudo-labeled training data generation for point tracking using the SMPL model, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal data and compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human motion is complex and rich for supervision but manual annotation is laborious. AnthroTAP aims to automate training data generation.

Method: Fits SMPL to humans in videos, projects 3D vertices to 2D, handles occlusions with ray-casting, and filters tracks using optical flow consistency.

Result: Achieves SOTA on TAP-Vid benchmark with 10,000x less data and 1 day on 4 GPUs vs. 256 GPUs in prior work.

Conclusion: AnthroTAP provides an efficient, scalable solution for training robust point trackers.

Abstract: Human motion, with its inherent complexities, such as non-rigid deformations,
articulated movements, clothing distortions, and frequent occlusions caused by
limbs or other individuals, provides a rich and challenging source of
supervision that is crucial for training robust and generalizable point
trackers. Despite the suitability of human motion, acquiring extensive training
data for point tracking remains difficult due to laborious manual annotation.
Our proposed pipeline, AnthroTAP, addresses this by proposing an automated
pipeline to generate pseudo-labeled training data, leveraging the Skinned
Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. We first fit the SMPL model to detected
humans in video frames, project the resulting 3D mesh vertices onto 2D image
planes to generate pseudo-trajectories, handle occlusions using ray-casting,
and filter out unreliable tracks based on optical flow consistency. A point
tracking model trained on AnthroTAP annotated dataset achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the TAP-Vid benchmark, surpassing other models trained on real
videos while using 10,000 times less data and only 1 day in 4 GPUs, compared to
256 GPUs used in recent state-of-the-art.

*Young Hun Kim,Seungyeon Kim,Yonghyeon Lee,Frank Chongwoo Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamGrasp uses generative models for partial-view 3D recognition, improving accuracy in cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in cluttered, occluded settings due to reliance on symmetry or curated datasets.

Method: Combines coarse 3D reconstruction, contrastive learning for segmentation, and text-guided refinement.

Result: Accurate geometry recovery and high success in tasks like decluttering and retrieval.

Conclusion: DreamGrasp is robust for 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments.

Abstract: Partial-view 3D recognition -- reconstructing 3D geometry and identifying
object instances from a few sparse RGB images -- is an exceptionally
challenging yet practically essential task, particularly in cluttered, occluded
real-world settings where full-view or reliable depth data are often
unavailable. Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or
supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios.
In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the
imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to
infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction,
instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise
refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables
robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments
show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also
supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval
with high success rates.

*Haitao Lu,Haijier Chen,Haoze Liu,Shoujian Zhang,Bo Xu,Ziao Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 3DGS-LSR is a relocalization framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting for precise, monocular RGB-based localization in urban environments, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS positioning is unreliable in urban areas due to signal issues, and traditional mapping methods are inefficient for resource-constrained robots.

Method: Combines multi-sensor data for high-accuracy 3DGS maps and uses SuperPoint/SuperGlue for feature matching with iterative optimization for real-time localization.

Result: Achieves average accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in different urban scenarios on KITTI dataset.

Conclusion: 3DGS-LSR enables reliable, centimeter-level localization in GNSS-challenged urban environments with minimal hardware requirements.

Abstract: In autonomous robotic systems, precise localization is a prerequisite for
safe navigation. However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often
suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable
absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage
requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to
resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose
3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single
monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to
construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side
localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and
SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an
iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through
step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation.
Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves
average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads,
boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly
outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB
input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization
capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.

*He Wang,Linhan Ma,Dake Guo,Xiong Wang,Lei Xie,Jin Xu,Junyang Lin*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContextASR-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating contextual speech recognition, leveraging advancements in LLMs and LALMs to address limitations of traditional ASR models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior ASR evaluations lacked context modeling, prompting the need for a benchmark to assess both generality and intelligence in ASR systems.

Method: The authors propose ContextASR-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 40,000 data entries across 10 domains, evaluating performance with and without contextual information, including named entity recognition.

Result: LALMs, with superior world knowledge and context learning, significantly outperform traditional ASR models.

Conclusion: ContextASR-Bench fills a critical gap in ASR evaluation, demonstrating the advantages of LALMs in contextual speech recognition.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively investigated, yet
prior evaluative efforts have largely been restricted to contextless paradigms.
This constraint stems from the limited proficiency of conventional ASR models
in context modeling and their deficiency in memory and reasoning based on world
knowledge. Recent breakthroughs in the development of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and corresponding Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have markedly
enhanced the visibility of general artificial intelligence capabilities.
Consequently, there exists a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate
both the generality and intelligence of ASR systems. To address this gap, we
propose ContextASR-Bench: a comprehensive, large-scale benchmark designed to
assess contextual speech recognition. This benchmark encompasses up to 40,000
data entries across over 10 domains, enabling a thorough evaluation of model
performance in scenarios that omit or incorporate coarse-grained or
fine-grained contextual information. Moreover, diverging from conventional ASR
evaluations, our benchmark includes an analysis of model efficacy in
recognizing named entities mentioned within the auditory input. Our extensive
evaluation highlights that LALMs, with strong world knowledge and context
learning capabilities, outperform conventional ASR models by a large margin.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SQLBarber is an LLM-based system for generating customized and realistic SQL workloads, eliminating manual template crafting and scaling efficiently to match user-defined cost distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of acquiring real-world SQL queries due to privacy concerns and limitations of existing SQL generation methods.

Method: Uses LLMs with a self-correction module and Bayesian Optimizer to generate SQL templates and queries matching target cost distributions.

Result: Reduces query generation time significantly and improves alignment with target cost distributions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SQLBarber is effective for generating customized SQL workloads efficiently and realistically.

Abstract: Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries
for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is
challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are
limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address
this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i)
eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while
providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to
constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of
queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and
execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift
and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost
distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber
introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate
customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a
self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based
on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different
predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost
distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty
levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from
Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show
that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates.
It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and
significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared
with existing methods.

Motivation: Accurate segmentation of wounds and scale markers is crucial for wound management and automated assessment, but remains challenging due to class imbalance and variability in medical images.

Method: The study integrates channel-wise (SCSE) and spatial attention mechanisms into a U-Net++ architecture, using EfficientNet-B7 as the encoder backbone.

Conclusion: The dual-attention U-Net++ architecture is effective for complex medical segmentation tasks, addressing class imbalance and variability.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of wounds and scale markers in clinical images remainsa
significant challenge, crucial for effective wound management and
automatedassessment. In this study, we propose a novel dual-attention U-Net++
archi-tecture, integrating channel-wise (SCSE) and spatial attention mechanisms
toaddress severe class imbalance and variability in medical images
effectively.Initially, extensive benchmarking across diverse architectures and
encoders via 5-fold cross-validation identified EfficientNet-B7 as the optimal
encoder backbone.Subsequently, we independently trained two class-specific
models with tailoredpreprocessing, extensive data augmentation, and Bayesian
hyperparameter tun-ing (WandB sweeps). The final model ensemble utilized Test
Time Augmentationto further enhance prediction reliability. Our approach was
evaluated on a bench-mark dataset from the NBC 2025 & PCBBE 2025 competition.
Segmentationperformance was quantified using a weighted F1-score (75% wounds,
25% scalemarkers), calculated externally by competition organizers on
undisclosed hard-ware. The proposed approach achieved an F1-score of 0.8640,
underscoring itseffectiveness for complex medical segmentation tasks.

*Yi Liu,Yiyang Wen,Zekun Zhou,Junqi Ma,Linghang Wang,Yucheng Yao,Liu Shi,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A fast sampling diffusion model (PWD) is proposed for limited-angle CT reconstruction, combining prior information embedding and wavelet feature fusion to improve efficiency and preserve details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models for medical imaging are computationally intensive, and skip-sampling methods often lose fine structural details.

Method: PWD maps LACT images to fully sampled targets during training, uses LACT images as priors during inference, and performs wavelet-domain feature fusion.

Result: PWD achieves 1.7 dB PSNR and 10% SSIM improvement with only 50 sampling steps.

Conclusion: PWD efficiently reconstructs high-quality LACT images while preserving fine details, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have received increasing attention in medical
imaging, particularly in limited-angle computed tomography (LACT). Standard
diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large
number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial
computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to
improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To
address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet
feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD
enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT,
and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by
skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the
distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling
the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference,
the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory,
allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In
addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain,
effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both
low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate
that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using
only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and
10% gain in SSIM.

TL;DR: HA2HA is a self-supervised denoising framework for ultrasound microvascular imaging (UMI) that improves SNR and CNR by over 15 dB, validated across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low SNR in UMI, especially in contrast-free or deep tissue scenarios, hinders vascular quantification and disease diagnosis.

Method: HA2HA constructs training pairs from complementary angular subsets of RF blood flow data, leveraging consistent vascular signals and varying noise.

Result: Achieved >15 dB improvement in CNR and SNR, enhancing image quality and microvascular flow visualization in CDI.

Conclusion: HA2HA provides a label-free, generalizable, and clinically applicable solution for robust vascular imaging in UMI.

Abstract: Ultrasound microvascular imaging (UMI) is often hindered by low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially in contrast-free or deep tissue
scenarios, which impairs subsequent vascular quantification and reliable
disease diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose
Half-Angle-to-Half-Angle (HA2HA), a self-supervised denoising framework
specifically designed for UMI. HA2HA constructs training pairs from
complementary angular subsets of beamformed radio-frequency (RF) blood flow
data, across which vascular signals remain consistent while noise varies. HA2HA
was trained using in-vivo contrast-free pig kidney data and validated across
diverse datasets, including contrast-free and contrast-enhanced data from pig
kidneys, as well as human liver and kidney. An improvement exceeding 15 dB in
both contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and SNR was observed, indicating a
substantial enhancement in image quality. In addition to power Doppler imaging,
denoising directly in the RF domain is also beneficial for other downstream
processing such as color Doppler imaging (CDI). CDI results of human liver
derived from the HA2HA-denoised signals exhibited improved microvascular flow
visualization, with a suppressed noisy background. HA2HA offers a label-free,
generalizable, and clinically applicable solution for robust vascular imaging
in both contrast-free and contrast-enhanced UMI.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-Super, a report-supervision loss method to improve tumor segmentation in CT scans by leveraging radiology reports as additional supervision, achieving up to 16% F1 score improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tumor segmentation masks are scarce due to the time and expertise required for their creation, while radiology reports are abundant. Leveraging reports can scale segmentation AI.

Method: Proposed R-Super, a method converting radiology reports into voxel-wise supervision. Used a dataset of 6,718 CT-Report pairs from UCSF Hospital and merged it with public CT-Mask datasets.

Result: R-Super improved tumor segmentation significantly, with F1 score increasing by up to 16% compared to using masks alone, even with limited training masks (e.g., 50).

Conclusion: R-Super effectively leverages radiology reports to enhance tumor segmentation AI, demonstrating strong performance improvements in both low and high mask availability scenarios.

Abstract: Tumor segmentation in CT scans is key for diagnosis, surgery, and prognosis,
yet segmentation masks are scarce because their creation requires time and
expertise. Public abdominal CT datasets have from dozens to a couple thousand
tumor masks, but hospitals have hundreds of thousands of tumor CTs with
radiology reports. Thus, leveraging reports to improve segmentation is key for
scaling. In this paper, we propose a report-supervision loss (R-Super) that
converts radiology reports into voxel-wise supervision for tumor segmentation
AI. We created a dataset with 6,718 CT-Report pairs (from the UCSF Hospital),
and merged it with public CT-Mask datasets (from AbdomenAtlas 2.0). We used our
R-Super to train with these masks and reports, and strongly improved tumor
segmentation in internal and external validation--F1 Score increased by up to
16% with respect to training with masks only. By leveraging readily available
radiology reports to supplement scarce segmentation masks, R-Super strongly
improves AI performance both when very few training masks are available (e.g.,
50), and when many masks were available (e.g., 1.7K).

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) addresses noise and missing data by treating it as a sinogram inpainting task, using MR-SDE and RNSD+ for robust reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LACT suffers from incomplete sinograms and artifacts due to missing angular projections, and existing methods ignore measurement noise.

Method: Proposes a diffusion-based framework with MR-SDE for sinogram inpainting and RNSD+ for noise-aware rectification.

Result: Outperforms baselines in data consistency and perceptual quality, generalizing well across noise levels and scenarios.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles noise and missing data in LACT, offering reliable and robust reconstruction.

Abstract: Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) is a challenging inverse problem
where missing angular projections lead to incomplete sinograms and severe
artifacts in the reconstructed images. While recent learning-based methods have
demonstrated effectiveness, most of them assume ideal, noise-free measurements
and fail to address the impact of measurement noise. To overcome this
limitation, we treat LACT as a sinogram inpainting task and propose a
diffusion-based framework that completes missing angular views using a
Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equation (MR-SDE) formulation. To
improve robustness under realistic noise, we propose RNSD$^+$, a novel
noise-aware rectification mechanism that explicitly models inference-time
uncertainty, enabling reliable and robust reconstruction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses baseline models in data
consistency and perceptual quality, and generalizes well across varying noise
intensity and acquisition scenarios.

TL;DR: ADPv2 is a new dataset for gastrointestinal histopathology, offering granular annotations for 32 histological tissue types. A VMamba-based model achieves high accuracy (mAP 0.88) and reveals insights into colon cancer pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack granular annotations for specific organ diseases, limiting in-depth studies. ADPv2 addresses this gap for gastrointestinal histopathology.

Method: A two-stage training procedure on ADPv2 dataset using VMamba architecture for multilabel classification.

Result: Achieved mAP of 0.88 in classifying colon HTTs and identified statistical patterns in colon cancer pathways.

Conclusion: ADPv2 enables organ-specific studies and biomarker discovery, with potential applications in colon cancer research.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CoPath) leverages histopathology images to enhance
diagnostic precision and reproducibility in clinical pathology. However,
publicly available datasets for CoPath that are annotated with extensive
histological tissue type (HTT) taxonomies at a granular level remain scarce due
to the significant expertise and high annotation costs required. Existing
datasets, such as the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP), address this by
offering diverse HTT annotations generalized to multiple organs, but limit the
capability for in-depth studies on specific organ diseases. Building upon this
foundation, we introduce ADPv2, a novel dataset focused on gastrointestinal
histopathology. Our dataset comprises 20,004 image patches derived from healthy
colon biopsy slides, annotated according to a hierarchical taxonomy of 32
distinct HTTs of 3 levels. Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation
learning model following a two-stage training procedure on our ADPv2 dataset.
We leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision
(mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification of colon HTTs. Finally, we show that
our dataset is capable of an organ-specific in-depth study for potential
biomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues
affected by different colon diseases, which reveals statistical patterns that
confirm the two pathological pathways of colon cancer development. Our dataset
is publicly available here: Part 1 at https://zenodo.org/records/15307021, Part

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive nature of creating foundation models in computational pathology by introducing a supervised, efficient alternative.

Method: Uses supervised, end-to-end multitask learning on slide-level labels, requiring fewer training resources than self-supervised methods.

Result: Outperforms self-supervised models in cancer subtyping benchmarks and is trained on freely available data. Includes an explainable attention module.

Conclusion: TCv2 provides a practical, high-performing, and explainable solution for computational pathology, reducing resource demands.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are transforming the field of computational pathology
by offering new approaches to analyzing histopathology images. Typically
relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a
resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the
extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide
images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for
whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end
multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the
training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model
shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping
benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared
trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across
different tasks.

TL;DR: A DL framework automates co-registration of IVUS and OCT images, achieving high accuracy and speed comparable to expert analysts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fully automated, efficient co-registration of IVUS and OCT images for large-scale research on plaque composition.

Method: DL solutions trained on expert-annotated data (61,655 NIRS-IVUS and 62,334 OCT frames) for feature extraction, combined with dynamic time warping and dynamic programming for co-registration.

Result: High concordance (CCC >0.99 longitudinal, >0.90 circumferential) and Williams Index (0.96 longitudinal, 0.97 circumferential) comparable to experts, processing time <90s per vessel.

Conclusion: The DL framework is fast, accurate, and useful for large-scale multimodality imaging studies.

Abstract: Aims: To develop a deep-learning (DL) framework that will allow fully
automated longitudinal and circumferential co-registration of intravascular
ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Methods and
results: Data from 230 patients (714 vessels) with acute coronary syndrome that
underwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-IVUS and OCT imaging in their
non-culprit vessels were included in the present analysis. The lumen borders
annotated by expert analysts in 61,655 NIRS-IVUS and 62,334 OCT frames, and the
side branches and calcific tissue identified in 10,000 NIRS-IVUS frames and
10,000 OCT frames, were used to train DL solutions for the automated extraction
of these features. The trained DL solutions were used to process NIRS-IVUS and
OCT images and their output was used by a dynamic time warping algorithm to
co-register longitudinally the NIRS-IVUS and OCT images, while the
circumferential registration of the IVUS and OCT was optimized through dynamic
programming. On a test set of 77 vessels from 22 patients, the DL method showed
high concordance with the expert analysts for the longitudinal and
circumferential co-registration of the two imaging sets (concordance
correlation coefficient >0.99 for the longitudinal and >0.90 for the
circumferential co-registration). The Williams Index was 0.96 for longitudinal
and 0.97 for circumferential co-registration, indicating a comparable
performance to the analysts. The time needed for the DL pipeline to process
imaging data from a vessel was <90s. Conclusion: The fully automated, DL-based

### [152] [Enhancing Synthetic CT from CBCT via Multimodal Fusion and End-To-End Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06067)
*Maximilian Tschuchnig,Lukas Lamminger,Philipp Steininger,Michael Gadermayr*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance synthetic CT (sCT) generation from CBCT by integrating a learnable registration module to address misalignment between CBCT and preoperative CT, improving sCT quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT images suffer from artifacts and lower quality compared to CT. Synthetic CT generation can bridge this gap, but misalignment between CBCT and preoperative CT data poses a challenge.

Method: An end-to-end learnable registration module is introduced within the sCT pipeline to align CBCT and preoperative CT data. The model is tested on synthetic and real-world clinical datasets.

Result: The integrated registration improves sCT quality, outperforming baseline methods in 79 out of 90 cases, especially when CBCT quality is low and preoperative CT is misaligned.

Conclusion: Jointly leveraging CBCT and preoperative CT with a registration module significantly enhances sCT generation, particularly in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for intraoperative
imaging due to its rapid acquisition and low radiation dose. However, CBCT
images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to
conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this
work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly
leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the
inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable
registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a
controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and
alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability
on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality,
outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings.
Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low
and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.

### [153] [LangMamba: A Language-driven Mamba Framework for Low-dose CT Denoising with Vision-language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06140)
*Zhihao Chen,Tao Chen,Chenhui Wang,Qi Gao,Huidong Xie,Chuang Niu,Ge Wang,Hongming Shan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework, uses vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance LDCT denoising by leveraging semantic guidance, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose CT (LDCT) reduces radiation but degrades image quality, and current deep learning methods lack high-level semantic guidance.

Method: Two-stage learning: pre-train a Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) for semantic mapping, then combine it with SEED for denoising and LangDA loss for alignment.

Result: LangMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improves detail preservation, and generalizes well to unseen datasets.

Conclusion: Language can effectively guide LDCT denoising, enhancing quality and explainability while reducing training costs.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but often
degrades image quality, potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy. Existing
deep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings,
overlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent
advances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a
powerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new
opportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce
LangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages
VLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT).
LangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a
Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT
images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we
synergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:
Semantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local
semantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and
Language-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that
denoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba
outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving
detail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong
generalizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.
Furthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided
insights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our
findings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to
advance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TuneShield is a defense framework for mitigating toxicity in chatbot fine-tuning, using LLM-based toxicity classification and synthetic 'healing data' to preserve conversational quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of toxicity in chatbot customization, especially with untrusted training data.

Method: Leverages LLM-based toxicity classification and generates synthetic 'healing data' to mitigate toxicity during fine-tuning, followed by an alignment process.

Result: Effectively mitigates toxicity injection attacks, preserves conversational quality, and resists adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: TuneShield is a robust solution for reducing toxicity in chatbot fine-tuning while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models, such as LLMs, have revolutionized
conversational AI. Chatbots are increasingly being developed by customizing
LLMs on specific conversational datasets. However, mitigating toxicity during
this customization, especially when dealing with untrusted training data,
remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce TuneShield, a
defense framework designed to mitigate toxicity during chatbot fine-tuning
while preserving conversational quality. TuneShield leverages LLM-based
toxicity classification, utilizing the instruction-following capabilities and
safety alignment of LLMs to effectively identify toxic samples, outperforming
industry API services. TuneShield generates synthetic conversation samples,
termed 'healing data', based on the identified toxic samples, using them to
mitigate toxicity while reinforcing desirable behavior during fine-tuning. It
performs an alignment process to further nudge the chatbot towards producing
desired responses. Our findings show that TuneShield effectively mitigates
toxicity injection attacks while preserving conversational quality, even when
the toxicity classifiers are imperfect or biased. TuneShield proves to be
resilient against adaptive adversarial and jailbreak attacks. Additionally,
TuneShield demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating adaptive toxicity injection
attacks during dialog-based learning (DBL).

*Aiur Nanzatov,Lourdes Peña-Castillo,Oscar Meruvia-Pastor*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: NRXR-ID enables 2FA in VR using smartphones without removing HMDs, testing four challenge types. Checkers-style was most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2FA is challenging in VR due to HMDs blocking real-world visibility. NRXR-ID addresses this gap.

Method: Implemented NRXR-ID with four challenge types (including checkers-style) and tested in a 4X3 within-subjects design with 30 participants.

Result: Checkers-style challenge was most effective, followed by digital PIN entry via smartphone.

Conclusion: NRXR-ID successfully enables 2FA in VR, with checkers-style challenges being optimal.

Abstract: Two-factor authentication (2FA) has become widely adopted as an efficient and
secure way to validate someone's identity online. Two-factor authentication is
difficult in virtual reality (VR) because users are usually wearing a
head-mounted display (HMD) which does not allow them to see their real-world
surroundings. We present NRXR-ID, a technique to implement two-factor
authentication while using extended reality systems and smartphones. The
proposed method allows users to complete an authentication challenge using
their smartphones without removing their HMD. We performed a user study where
we explored four types of challenges for users, including a novel
checkers-style challenge. Users responded to these challenges under three
different configurations, including a technique that uses the smartphone to
support gaze-based selection without the use of VR controllers. A 4X3
within-subjects design allowed us to study all the variations proposed. We
collected performance metrics and performed user experience questionnaires to
collect subjective impressions from 30 participants. Results suggest that the
checkers-style visual matching challenge was the most appropriate option,
followed by entering a digital PIN challenge submitted via the smartphone and
answered within the VR environment.

*Lorenzo Lee Solano,Charles Koutcheme,Juho Leinonen,Alexandra Vassar,Jake Renzella*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Smaller, specialized language models fine-tuned with domain-specific data outperform large models like ChatGPT for educational tools, offering comparable quality at lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLMs like ChatGPT are impractical for widespread educational use due to high computational costs and over-assistance. Smaller, fine-tuned models offer a viable alternative.

Method: Fine-tuned three open-source models (Qwen3-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-32B) using 40,000 C compiler error explanations. Evaluated via expert reviews and automated LLM-as-judge analysis.

Result: SFT significantly improves smaller models' pedagogical quality, matching larger models' performance. Trade-offs between size and quality favor compact, fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning smaller models on domain-specific data is effective for educational tools, providing a replicable methodology for broader AI adoption in education.

Abstract: Frontier Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini can decipher
cryptic compiler errors for novice programmers, but their computational scale,
cost, and tendency to over-assist make them problematic for widespread
pedagogical adoption. This work demonstrates that smaller, specialised language
models, enhanced via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), present a more viable
alternative for educational tools. We utilise a new dataset of 40,000 C
compiler error explanations, derived from real introductory programming (CS1/2)
student-generated programming errors, which we used to fine-tune three
open-source models: Qwen3-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen3-32B. We performed a dual
evaluation, combining expert human reviews with a large-scale automated
analysis of 8,000 responses using a validated LLM-as-judge ensemble. Our
results show that SFT significantly boosts the pedagogical quality of smaller
models, achieving performance comparable to much larger models. We analyse the
trade-offs between model size and quality, confirming that fine-tuning compact,
efficient models on high-quality, domain-specific data is a potent strategy for
creating specialised models to drive educational tools. We provide a replicable
methodology to foster broader access to generative AI capabilities in
educational contexts.

### [157] [Hidden Prompts in Manuscripts Exploit AI-Assisted Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06185)
*Zhicheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Hidden prompts in arXiv manuscripts manipulated AI peer review, revealing vulnerabilities in automated academic systems and prompting calls for better policies and screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the unethical practice of embedding hidden prompts in manuscripts to manipulate AI-assisted peer review and highlight systemic risks in automated academic evaluation.

Method: Examined 18 arXiv manuscripts with concealed prompts, categorized four types of hidden instructions, and evaluated defenses and publisher policies.

Result: Discovered self-serving intent behind prompts, inconsistent publisher policies, and broader vulnerabilities in automated academic systems.

Conclusion: Urges coordinated technical screening and harmonized policies for GenAI use in academic evaluation to prevent manipulation.

Abstract: In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were
found to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate
AI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as "GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY"
were concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses
varied: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the
practice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes
this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique
of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of
hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed
evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as "honeypots" to detect
reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently
self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate.
Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer
review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure
requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond
peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including
plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need
for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized
policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), a BCI algorithm that improves cross-subject adaptability by extracting common features from EEG data, achieving a 3.28% performance boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BCI models struggle with inter-individual variability, limiting generalizability. The goal is to enhance adaptability across subjects.

Method: 1) Train personalized models; 2) Transform models into relation spectrums; 3) Identify common features statistically; 4) Build a universal model.

Result: CSDD outperforms existing methods by 3.28% on the BCIC IV 2a dataset.

Conclusion: CSDD introduces a novel way to extract common features, enabling broader BCI applications.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables direct
control of external devices by decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG)
generated in the brain during imagined movements. However, due to
inter-individual variability in brain activity, existing BCI models exhibit
poor adaptability across subjects, thereby limiting their generalizability and
widespread application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a
universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific
methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2)
transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common
features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject
universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV
2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for
training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding
performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results
demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves
a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a
novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal
cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI
technology.

TL;DR: ECORE is a framework for optimizing energy and accuracy in edge-based object detection by dynamically routing tasks to suitable edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices face challenges in balancing energy efficiency and detection accuracy for real-time vision tasks.

Method: ECORE integrates dynamic routing strategies (estimation-based techniques and greedy selection) to direct tasks to optimal edge device-model pairs.

Result: ECORE reduces energy consumption by 45% and latency by 49%, with only a 2% accuracy loss compared to accuracy-centric methods.

Conclusion: ECORE effectively balances energy efficiency and detection performance for edge-based object detection.

Abstract: Edge computing enables data processing closer to the source, significantly
reducing latency an essential requirement for real-time vision-based analytics
such as object detection in surveillance and smart city environments. However,
these tasks place substantial demands on resource constrained edge devices,
making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy
critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that
integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies including estimation based
techniques and a greedy selection algorithm to direct image processing requests
to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy
efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We
evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on real-world datasets,
comparing the proposed routers against widely used baseline techniques. The
evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD,
EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry
Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators. Results demonstrate that our proposed
context-aware routing strategies can reduce energy consumption and latency by
45% and 49%, respectively, while incurring only a 2% loss in detection accuracy
compared to accuracy-centric methods.

TL;DR: 3DGeoMeshNet is a GCN-based framework using anisotropic convolutions to learn global and local features directly from 3D meshes, outperforming previous methods in reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending CNNs to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to their non-Euclidean nature. Existing GCN methods often fail to capture both local and global features effectively.

Method: Introduces 3DGeoMeshNet, a GCN framework with anisotropic convolution layers and a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure to preserve the original mesh format and capture both global and local features.

Result: Demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy on the COMA dataset, particularly for human face meshes.

Conclusion: 3DGeoMeshNet effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by directly processing 3D meshes and capturing multi-scale features, leading to more accurate reconstructions.

Abstract: 3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex
geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like
images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a
solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing
methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their
ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we
introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework
that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and
local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that
convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point
clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the
reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our
architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate
global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and
fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset
containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of
reconstruction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods require meticulously captured images, limiting accessibility. LighthouseGS aims to enable high-fidelity rendering with simple handheld camera panoramas.

Method: LighthouseGS uses rough geometric priors (camera poses, monocular depth), planar structures, and introduces plane scaffold assembly for initialization, pruning, and corrections for motion drift and auto-exposure.

Result: LighthouseGS achieves photorealistic rendering in indoor scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

Conclusion: LighthouseGS demonstrates practical high-fidelity novel view synthesis with handheld cameras, expanding accessibility for general users.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel
view synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However,
achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images
covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to
develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion
with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this
rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D
point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To
address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired
by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS
leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and
monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in
indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane
scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures,
followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization
stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to
resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices.
Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers
photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating
the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs lack diversity, complexity, and reliability in evaluating real-world software engineering workflows.

Method: CorePipe converts repositories into test cases, and CoreCodeBench offers configurable multi-scenario benchmarks with atomic and composite questions.

Result: Experiments with 16 LLMs show varying capabilities, providing insights into their performance in engineering contexts.

Conclusion: CoreCodeBench is a comprehensive tool for evaluating LLMs in real-world engineering projects, with open-source code and data available.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly sophisticated code
processing capabilities, evaluating their performance on engineering-level code
remains challenging. Existing repository-level benchmarks primarily focus on
single scenarios, such as code generation or bug fixing, without adequately
capturing the diversity and complexity of real-world software or project
engineering workflows. Furthermore, these benchmarks suffer from limited
controllability in question positioning and reliability issues in their
generated test cases. To address these limitations, we present CorePipe, a
fully automated pipeline that converts repositories into comprehensive test
cases, and introduce CoreCodeBench, a configurable multi-scenario
repository-level benchmark. To simulate real engineering scenarios, CorePipe
generates three types of atomic questions (Development, BugFix, and Test-Driven
Development) specifically targeting core code segments. These atomic questions
are further combined into three types of composite questions, with difficulty
levels flexibly adjusted through hyperparameter tuning. CoreCodeBench provides
a comprehensive and extensive repository-level benchmark to investigate the
applicability of LLMs in real-world engineering projects. Experiments with 16
LLMs across diverse scenarios reveal varying capabilities and offer
multi-dimensional insights into LLM performance in engineering contexts. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual data collection for traffic light detection in ADSs is labor-intensive and limited in diversity, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: TigAug uses metamorphic relations and transformations based on weather, camera, and traffic light properties to augment images for testing and retraining.

Result: Experiments show TigAug effectively tests models, efficiently synthesizes images, and produces natural-looking results.

Conclusion: TigAug addresses the limitations of manual data collection, enhancing the reliability of traffic light detection in ADSs.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle technology has been developed in the last decades with
recent advances in sensing and computing technology. There is an urgent need to
ensure the reliability and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs).
Despite the recent achievements in testing various ADS modules, little
attention has been paid on the automated testing of traffic light detection
models in ADSs. A common practice is to manually collect and label traffic
light data. However, it is labor-intensive, and even impossible to collect
diverse data under different driving environments.
  To address these problems, we propose and implement TigAug to automatically
augment labeled traffic light images for testing traffic light detection models
in ADSs. We construct two families of metamorphic relations and three families
of transformations based on a systematic understanding of weather environments,
camera properties, and traffic light properties. We use augmented images to
detect erroneous behaviors of traffic light detection models by
transformation-specific metamorphic relations, and to improve the performance
of traffic light detection models by retraining. Large-scale experiments with
four state-of-the-art traffic light detection models and two traffic light
datasets have demonstrated that i) TigAug is effective in testing traffic light
detection models, ii) TigAug is efficient in synthesizing traffic light images,
and iii) TigAug generates traffic light images with acceptable naturalness.

TL;DR: Chat2SPaT uses LLMs to convert semi-structured traffic signal control descriptions into exact SPaT results, achieving over 94% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual traffic signal plan management is tedious and repetitive, especially with multiple time-of-day or day-of-week plans.

Method: Leverages LLMs to understand and reformat user descriptions into JSON, then uses Python scripts to assemble complete signal plans.

Result: Achieves over 94% accuracy in generating plans from English and Chinese descriptions.

Conclusion: Chat2SPaT offers an easy-to-use, accurate solution for traffic signal plan management, showcasing LLMs' potential in ITS.

Abstract: Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized
intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for
signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans
are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading
to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a
user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study
proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous
descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)
results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or
ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)
software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first
leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan
descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and
phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python
scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic
signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.
Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan
editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of
over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300
plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of
understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an
easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,
serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile
application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test
dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the application of VLMs in AR training and address gaps in fine-grained vision-language alignment, especially for equitable AI-driven learning.

Method: Created a dataset for AR training, systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluated nine state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o.

Result: Advanced VLMs struggle with fine-grained tasks, achieving only 40.54% F1 score on state detection, indicating a need for improved datasets and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work underscores the need for enhanced vision-language alignment and has social implications for equitable AI access, especially for visually impaired users.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart
assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their
application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training,
featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine
state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models,
including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a
maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight
the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve
fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our
work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and
visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning
opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source
code, and evaluation results, to support the research community.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CROP, a Chinese dataset for ROP risk prediction, and Affective-ROPTester, a framework to evaluate LLMs' predictive capabilities and affective biases using three prompting strategies. Results show LLMs improve with external knowledge and exhibit affective biases, mitigated by positive emotional framing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' unexplored capacity in predicting ROP risk and investigate affective biases in their predictions.

Method: Proposed Affective-ROPTester framework with three prompting strategies (Instruction-based, CoT, ICL) and emotional elements to assess LLMs' performance and biases.

Result: LLMs perform poorly with intrinsic knowledge but improve with external inputs. Affective biases exist, with positive framing reducing bias.

Conclusion: Affect-sensitive prompt engineering is crucial for reliable diagnostics, and Affective-ROPTester is effective for evaluating and mitigating biases in clinical LLMs.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across
various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel
Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records
annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the
predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk
stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation
framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme
assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and
ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate
how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP
and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield
two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP
risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit
marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.
Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent
inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared
to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating
predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of
affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and
emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and
mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MusiScene, a model for Music Scene Imagination (MSI), which generates scene descriptions for music by leveraging cross-modal video-audio data. It outperforms MU-LLaMA and enhances Video Background Music Generation (VBMG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable AI models to imagine scenes from music, similar to humans, by integrating cross-modal information from video and audio, improving upon music captioning models that focus only on musical elements.

Method: 1) Build a dataset of 3,371 video-audio caption pairs. 2) Finetune Music Understanding LLaMA (MU-LLaMA) for MSI to create MusiScene. 3) Evaluate MusiScene's performance in generating contextually relevant captions.

Result: MusiScene outperforms MU-LLaMA in generating scene descriptions for music and enhances VBMG by providing better text-based inputs.

Conclusion: MusiScene successfully bridges music and scene imagination, proving effective for MSI and improving VBMG, demonstrating the value of cross-modal training.

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music,
envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow,
melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies
suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g.
MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI),
which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To
improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical
elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine
scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a
large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music
Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct
comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of
generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the
generated MSI captions to enhance Video Background Music Generation (VBMG) from
text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static tools like PHQ-9 lack interactivity and adaptability, prompting the development of HopeBot to enhance user experience and scalability in depression screening.

Method: HopeBot uses retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification to administer PHQ-9. A within-subject study with 132 adults compared self-administered and chatbot versions.

Result: Scores showed strong agreement (ICC=0.91). 71% of participants trusted the chatbot more due to clearer structure and supportive tone. Comfort and clarity ratings were high (8.4 and 7.7 out of 10). 87.1% would reuse or recommend HopeBot.

Conclusion: Voice-based LLM chatbots like HopeBot are feasible, scalable, and low-burden adjuncts for routine depression screening.

Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively
screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed
HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the
PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a
within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both
self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement
(ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative
feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer
structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10)
were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics,
and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by
employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall,
87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings
demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden
adjuncts for routine depression screening.

TL;DR: Proactive defense framework for LLM-generated misinformation, improving prevention by 63% over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address societal risks of LLM-generated misinformation, which is self-reinforcing and hard to detect with traditional methods.

Method: Three Pillars framework: Knowledge Credibility, Inference Reliability, and Input Robustness.

Result: 63% improvement in misinformation prevention, though with computational overhead and generalization challenges.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on robust knowledge, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces for LLMs.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across critical
domains has amplified the societal risks posed by algorithmically generated
misinformation. Unlike traditional false content, LLM-generated misinformation
can be self-reinforcing, highly plausible, and capable of rapid propagation
across multiple languages, which traditional detection methods fail to mitigate
effectively. This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm, shifting from
passive post hoc detection to anticipatory mitigation strategies. We propose a
Three Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of
training and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding
self-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness,
enhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks.
Through a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative
meta-analysis, we demonstrate that proactive defense strategies offer up to
63\% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention,
despite non-trivial computational overhead and generalization challenges. We
argue that future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge
foundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure
LLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes citation patterns in AI-powered search systems, revealing a concentration of news citations among a few outlets with a liberal bias, though low-credibility sources are rarely cited. User satisfaction is unaffected by the political leaning or quality of cited sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the citation behavior of AI search systems, which are increasingly influential but poorly studied in this regard.

Method: Analysis of data from the AI Search Arena, including 24,000 conversations and 65,000 responses from models by OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google, examining 366,000 citations.

Result: 9% of citations reference news sources, with concentration among a few outlets and a liberal bias. Low-credibility sources are rarely cited, and user satisfaction is unaffected by political leaning or source quality.

Conclusion: The findings highlight challenges in AI search systems and implications for their design and governance.

Abstract: AI-powered search systems are emerging as new information gatekeepers,
fundamentally transforming how users access news and information. Despite their
growing influence, the citation patterns of these systems remain poorly
understood. We address this gap by analyzing data from the AI Search Arena, a
head-to-head evaluation platform for AI search systems. The dataset comprises
over 24,000 conversations and 65,000 responses from models across three major
providers: OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google. Among the over 366,000 citations
embedded in these responses, 9% reference news sources. We find that while
models from different providers cite distinct news sources, they exhibit shared
patterns in citation behavior. News citations concentrate heavily among a small
number of outlets and display a pronounced liberal bias, though low-credibility
sources are rarely cited. User preference analysis reveals that neither the
political leaning nor the quality of cited news sources significantly
influences user satisfaction. These findings reveal significant challenges in
current AI search systems and have important implications for their design and
governance.

paper presents the methodologies and results from our participation in this
challenge where we built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can
answer biomedical questions by retrieving relevant PubMed documents and
snippets to generate answers. For the retrieval task, we generated dense
embeddings from biomedical articles for initial retrieval, and applied an
ensemble of finetuned cross-encoders and large language models (LLMs) for
re-ranking to identify top relevant documents. Our solution achieved an MAP@10
of 0.1581, placing 10th on the leaderboard for the retrieval task. For answer
generation, we employed few-shot prompting of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our
system achieved macro-F1 score of 0.95 for yes/no questions (rank 12), Mean
Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.64 for factoid questions (rank 1), mean-F1 score of

Abstract: Vector retrieval systems exhibit significant performance variance across
queries due to heterogeneous embedding quality. We propose a lightweight
framework for predicting retrieval performance at the query level by combining
quantization robustness and neighborhood density metrics. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that high-quality embeddings occupy geometrically
stable regions in the embedding space and exhibit consistent neighborhood
structures. We evaluate our method on 4 standard retrieval datasets, showing
consistent improvements of 9.4$\pm$1.2\% in Recall@10 over competitive
baselines. The framework requires minimal computational overhead (less than 5\%
of retrieval time) and enables adaptive retrieval strategies. Our analysis
reveals systematic patterns in embedding quality across different query types,
providing insights for targeted training data augmentation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) in continual post-training (CPT), finding RFT better preserves prior knowledge and general capabilities, while SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of learning paradigms (SFT vs. RFT) on knowledge retention in CPT, an area previously overlooked.

Method: Comparative analysis of SFT and RFT on seven multimodal tasks using Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with experiments and a rollout-based filtering algorithm for RFT.

Result: RFT preserves prior knowledge and general capabilities, outperforming SFT, which causes catastrophic forgetting. Implicit regularization in RFT is key.

Conclusion: RFT is superior for CPT due to its robustness in knowledge retention and enhancement of general capabilities.

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for
adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific
and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily
concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter
regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two
core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge
retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising
seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base
model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant
findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to
catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT
inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to
multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the
model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).
Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis
shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought
reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit
regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.
Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the
stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the
superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the risks and behaviors associated with LLM memorization, including privacy concerns and the distinction between learning and memorization.

Method: Synthesizes studies on memorization drivers (e.g., data duplication, training dynamics) and evaluates detection techniques like prefix-based extraction and adversarial prompting.

Result: Identifies key factors influencing memorization and assesses detection/mitigation methods, highlighting challenges in balancing privacy and utility.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive review of LLM memorization, emphasizing the need for future work to address ethical, legal, and technical challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training
data. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy
risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these
concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape
of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and
mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication,
training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization.
In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction,
membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness
in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we
also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and
ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data
cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while
highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful
memorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and
performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.

TL;DR: AutoTriton is a reinforcement learning (RL)-based model for automating Triton programming, achieving performance comparable to large models like Claude-4-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1-0528.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning of Triton programming parameters is time-consuming and limits optimal performance. AutoTriton aims to automate this process using RL.

Method: AutoTriton uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for Triton expertise and RL with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for further optimization.

Result: AutoTriton matches the performance of mainstream large models in TritonBench and KernelBench evaluations.

Conclusion: AutoTriton demonstrates RL's potential for automating high-performance kernel generation, advancing efficient AI systems.

Abstract: Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units
across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and
hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although
domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting
low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such
as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,
creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In
this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton
programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming
expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based
reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming
ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of
TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves
performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet
and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial
role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,
and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for
automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance
kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an
important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code
will be available at https://github.com/AI9Stars/AutoTriton.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents trained offline suffer from scalability issues, overfitting, and brittleness in unseen environments.

Method: MobileGUI-RL trains agents online with self-exploration for task synthesis and adapts GRPO with trajectory-aware advantages and composite rewards.

Result: Experiments on mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent performance gains.

Conclusion: MobileGUI-RL effectively improves GUI agent training by addressing offline limitations and enhancing adaptability.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of vision-based GUI agents designed to
automate everyday mobile and web tasks. These agents interpret raw GUI
screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which
bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing
methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected
trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific
UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment.
We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online
environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a
curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii)
adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite
rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on
three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to
irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This
degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and
retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that
differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their
effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether
these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to
Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that
achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a
naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires
careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel
differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling
benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior
performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that
our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based
models. Our code is publicly available.

TL;DR: A novel data-driven model (cGNN) predicts soft tissue deformation and interaction forces, trained on experimental and simulated data, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft tissue simulation is crucial for medical applications but faces challenges due to high deformability and the need for precise haptic feedback.

Method: Uses a conditional graph neural network (cGNN) trained on experimental and simulated data (mass-spring simulations) with transfer learning to address data scarcity.

Result: Predicts deformations with 0.35±0.03 mm error (up to 30 mm) and forces with 0.37±0.05 N error (up to 7.5 N).

Conclusion: The data-driven approach offers a promising solution for realistic soft tissue simulations, applicable beyond medical fields.

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly
important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft
tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,
meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the
integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a
more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a
conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model
takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically
designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on
them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of
a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity
by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with
the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of
the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and
corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can
predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations
up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces
up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the
intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments.
Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the
potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are
required.

*Sofiia Chorna,Kateryna Tarelkina,Eloïse Berthier,Gianni Franchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework and tool (BAGEL) for global mechanistic interpretability of neural networks, analyzing concept emergence and interactions across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend local interpretability methods to global mechanistic understanding of model behavior, focusing on semantic concepts and their propagation.

Method: Systematically quantify concept representation across layers, visualize insights via a structured knowledge graph (BAGEL).

Result: Reveals latent circuits and information flow, identifies spurious correlations, and enhances model trustworthiness.

Conclusion: The framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and improves understanding of model generalization and dataset biases.

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on
local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework
and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic
interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by
analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge,
interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work
that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically
quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing
latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key
innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis
with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a
structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class
relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model
trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to
a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in
the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at

### [184] [Fair Domain Generalization: An Information-Theoretic View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05823)
*Tangzheng Lian,Guanyu Hu,Dimitrios Kollias,Xinyu Yang,Oya Celiktutan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairDG, a framework combining domain generalization and algorithmic fairness, and proposes PAFDG to optimize utility-fairness trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between domain generalization (focusing on risk) and fairness methods (ignoring domain shifts) by unifying both objectives.

Method: Derives mutual information-based bounds for risk and fairness, then designs PAFDG using Pareto optimization for trade-offs.

Result: PAFDG outperforms existing methods in balancing utility and fairness on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: FairDG and PAFDG effectively bridge domain generalization and fairness, offering practical solutions for unseen domains.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical
challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on
minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering
algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for
domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to
unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem
of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected
risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual
information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in
multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These
bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic
perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal
Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the
FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto
optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that
PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing
methods.
