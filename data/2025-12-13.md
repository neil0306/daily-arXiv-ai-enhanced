### [1] [What Kind of Reasoning (if any) is an LLM actually doing? On the Stochastic Nature and Abductive Appearance of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10080)
*Luciano Floridi,Jessica Morley,Claudio Novelli,David Watson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs appear to perform abductive reasoning but actually generate text based on learned patterns from human texts, lacking true reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how token-completion LLMs work, their stochastic nature, and their superficial similarity to human abductive reasoning, revealing that they don't actually perform reasoning but mimic it from training data.

Method: Analyzes LLMs' token-completion mechanism, compares their output to human abductive reasoning, uses examples to demonstrate how they produce plausible ideas without true reasoning, and addresses objections to these findings.

Result: LLMs generate text based on learned patterns from human-generated texts containing reasoning structures, producing outputs that appear abductive but lack grounding in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding.

Conclusion: LLMs have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, requiring critical assessment of outputs since they cannot identify truth or verify explanations. They can assist with idea generation but must be used with awareness of their limitations.

Abstract: This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation.

### [2] [Generate-Then-Validate: A Novel Question Generation Approach Using Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10110)
*Yumou Wei,John Stamper,Paulo F. Carvalho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs can generate high-quality educational questions using a "generate-then-validate" pipeline with probabilistic reasoning, achieving results comparable to human/LLM evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore small language models (SLMs) as an alternative to large language models for automatic question generation in learning analytics, leveraging their specific strengths in a cost-effective way.

Method: A novel question generation pipeline using SLMs with "generate-then-validate" strategy: first expansive generation of candidate questions, then selective validation through probabilistic reasoning to refine quality.

Result: Two evaluation studies (human experts and LLM) showed most judges agreed generated questions had clear answers and aligned well with learning objectives, demonstrating SLMs can produce high-quality questions.

Conclusion: SLMs can effectively generate high-quality educational questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages their text generation and probabilistic reasoning capabilities, offering a viable complement to LLMs.

Abstract: We explore the use of small language models (SLMs) for automatic question generation as a complement to the prevalent use of their large counterparts in learning analytics research. We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a "generate-then-validate" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.

### [3] [Workflow is All You Need: Escaping the "Statistical Smoothing Trap" via High-Entropy Information Foraging and Adversarial Pacing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10121)
*Zhongjie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepNews Framework addresses LLM limitations in financial journalism by modeling expert cognitive processes to achieve low hallucination, logical coherence, and personalization simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs face an "impossible trinity" in vertical domains like financial journalism: they struggle to simultaneously achieve low hallucination, deep logical coherence, and personalized expression due to the Statistical Smoothing Trap that overlooks expert cognitive processes.

Method: DeepNews Framework models expert journalist cognition with three modules: 1) dual-granularity retrieval with 10:1 saturated information input ratio, 2) schema-guided strategic planning using narrative schemas and Atomic Blocks, and 3) adversarial constraint prompting with techniques like Rhythm Break and Logic Fog.

Result: Experiments reveal a Knowledge Cliff where truthfulness collapses below 15,000 characters of retrieved context, while high-redundancy input (>30,000 chars) stabilizes Hallucination-Free Rate above 85%. In blind tests with a top Chinese tech media outlet, DeepNews achieved 25% acceptance rate vs. 0% for SOTA GPT-5 zero-shot generation.

Conclusion: The DeepNews Framework successfully addresses the "impossible trinity" by explicitly modeling expert cognitive processes, demonstrating that structured workflows can overcome LLM limitations in specialized domains like financial journalism.

Abstract: Central to long-form text generation in vertical domains is the "impossible trinity" confronting current large language models (LLMs): the simultaneous achievement of low hallucination, deep logical coherence, and personalized expression. This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%. In an ecological validity blind test conducted with a top-tier Chinese technology media outlet, the DeepNews system--built on a previous-generation model (DeepSeek-V3-0324)-achieved a 25% submission acceptance rate, significantly outperforming the 0% acceptance rate of zero-shot generation by a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model (GPT-5).

### [4] [PARAN: Persona-Augmented Review ANswering system on Food Delivery Review Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10148)
*Moonsoo Park,Jeongseok Yun,Bohyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage prompting framework that infers explicit and implicit personas from short reviews to generate personalized responses using LLMs without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized review response generation is challenging when user information is limited (e.g., food delivery platforms). LLMs produce generic responses without contextual user data, reducing engagement and effectiveness.

Method: Two-stage prompting framework: 1) Infer both explicit (user-stated preferences) and implicit (demographic/stylistic cues) personas from short review texts, 2) Incorporate inferred persona attributes into response generation prompt. Adjust decoding temperature during inference to encourage diverse yet faithful generations.

Result: Evaluated on real-world dataset from Korean food delivery app, showing effectiveness in enhancing precision, diversity, and semantic consistency of responses.

Conclusion: Persona-augmented prompting effectively enhances relevance and personalization of automated responses without requiring model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Personalized review response generation presents a significant challenge in domains where user information is limited, such as food delivery platforms. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful text generation capabilities, they often produce generic responses when lacking contextual user data, reducing engagement and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a two-stage prompting framework that infers both explicit (e.g., user-stated preferences) and implicit (e.g., demographic or stylistic cues) personas directly from short review texts. These inferred persona attributes are then incorporated into the response generation prompt to produce user-tailored replies. To encourage diverse yet faithful generations, we adjust decoding temperature during inference. We evaluate our method using a real-world dataset collected from a Korean food delivery app, and assess its impact on precision, diversity, and semantic consistency. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of persona-augmented prompting in enhancing the relevance and personalization of automated responses without requiring model fine-tuning.

### [5] [Unforgotten Safety: Preserving Safety Alignment of Large Language Models with Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10150)
*Lama Alssum,Hani Itani,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CL approaches effectively mitigate safety degradation during LLM fine-tuning, with DER performing best across various tasks and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety alignment of LLMs is crucial as they become more democratized, but fine-tuning for new tasks causes safety degradation due to catastrophic forgetting, especially in fine-tuning-as-a-service scenarios with potential poisoned data.

Method: Frame safety preservation as a continual learning problem, adapt CL approaches (regularization-based, memory-based, model merging), evaluate in two scenarios (benign and poisoned user data) across three tasks and three model families.

Result: CL approaches consistently achieve lower attack success rates than standard fine-tuning. DER outperforms other CL methods and existing safety-preserving baselines while maintaining task utility.

Conclusion: Continual learning provides a practical solution to preserve safety during LLM fine-tuning, with DER being particularly effective across diverse scenarios, tasks, and model families.

Abstract: The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important with their democratization. In this paper, we study the safety degradation that comes with adapting LLMs to new tasks. We attribute this safety compromise to catastrophic forgetting and frame the problem of preserving safety when fine-tuning as a continual learning (CL) problem. We consider the fine-tuning-as-a-service setup where the user uploads their data to a service provider to get a customized model that excels on the user's selected task. We adapt several CL approaches from the literature and systematically evaluate their ability to mitigate safety degradation. These include regularization-based, memory-based, and model merging approaches. We consider two scenarios, (1) benign user data and (2) poisoned user data. Our results demonstrate that CL approaches consistently achieve lower attack success rates than standard fine-tuning. Among these, DER outperforms both other CL methods and existing safety-preserving baselines while maintaining task utility. These findings generalize across three downstream tasks (GSM8K, SST2, Code) and three model families (LLaMA2-7B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2B), establishing CL as a practical solution to preserve safety.

### [6] [AutoMedic: An Automated Evaluation Framework for Clinical Conversational Agents with Medical Dataset Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10195)
*Gyutaek Oh,Sangjoon Park,Byung-Hoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoMedic is a multi-agent simulation framework that automatically evaluates LLMs as clinical conversational agents by transforming static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles for realistic multi-turn dialogues, assessed via the CARE metric covering accuracy, efficiency, empathy, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation in medicine relies on static QA benchmarks, which fail to assess dynamic, interactive clinical conversations and multi-faceted evaluation beyond simple accuracy. The vast combinatorial space of patient states and interaction trajectories makes formal evaluation of clinical conversations difficult to standardize and measure quantitatively.

Method: AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. It uses a multi-agent simulation framework where LLMs act as clinical conversational agents, with performance assessed via the CARE metric (Clinical conversational Accuracy, Efficiency/strategy, Empathy, and Robustness).

Result: The framework demonstrates validity as an automated evaluation system for clinical conversational agents, with findings validated by human experts. It provides practical guidelines for effective LLM development in conversational medical applications.

Conclusion: AutoMedic addresses critical gaps in LLM evaluation for medical applications by enabling automated, standardized assessment of clinical conversational abilities through simulated multi-turn dialogues and comprehensive multi-faceted metrics, validated by expert human evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a critical issue for safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in the medical domain. Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy. However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness. Our findings, validated by human experts, demonstrate the validity of AutoMedic as an automated evaluation framework for clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for the effective development of LLMs in conversational medical applications.

### [7] [Multilingual VLM Training: Adapting an English-Trained VLM to French](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10336)
*Jules Lahmi,Alexis Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual adaptation of English-trained Vision-Language Models faces challenges, with dataset translation being a major bottleneck limiting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Model advancements are primarily limited to English, reducing accessibility for non-English speakers, necessitating extension to broader language support.

Method: Compared three adaptation approaches: translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and two-stage finetuning separating vision and language adaptation. Evaluated using translated multimodal benchmarks and native expert assessments.

Result: Dataset translation emerged as the primary bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limitations affecting both training effectiveness and evaluation accuracy.

Conclusion: Future efforts should prioritize native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies rather than focusing solely on model adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made great progress in recent years, particularly in the development of Vision--Language Models (VLMs) that understand both visual and textual data. However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies.

*Zhaodong Wang,Zhenting Qi,Sherman Wong,Nathan Hu,Samuel Lin,Jun Ge,Erwin Gao,Yining Yang,Ben Maurer,Wenlin Chen,David Recordon,Yilun Du,Minlan Yu,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Confucius Code Agent (CCA) is an open-source AI software engineer that achieves state-of-the-art performance on industrial-scale software engineering tasks, built on the Confucius SDK platform with hierarchical memory, persistent note-taking, and automated agent configuration refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source coding agents lack industrial-scale capabilities, while proprietary agents lack transparency and extensibility. There's a need for AI software engineers that can handle massive repositories, maintain memory across sessions, and coordinate complex toolchains at industrial scale while being open and extensible.

Method: Built on Confucius SDK with three perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). Features include: 1) Unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, 2) Persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, 3) Modular extension module for robust tool use, and 4) Meta-agent that automates synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through build-test-improve loops.

Result: CCA achieves state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3% on SWE-Bench-Pro, substantially improving over prior coding agents. The system provides transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents that bridges research prototypes and production-grade systems.

Conclusion: Confucius SDK and CCA provide a comprehensive solution for industrial-scale AI software engineering that combines the transparency of open-source with the practical performance of proprietary systems, enabling rapid agent development and deployment at scale.

Abstract: Real-world AI software engineering demands coding agents that can reason over massive repositories, maintain durable memory across and within long sessions, and robustly coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.

### [9] [Sliding Window Attention Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10411)
*Yijiong Yu,Jiale Liu,Qingyun Wu,Huazheng Wang,Ji Pei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FA-pretrained LLMs can be adapted to sliding window attention (SWA) for efficient long-context inference using SWAA recipes combining five methods, recovering original performance without pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention in Transformers scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention reduces cost to linear complexity, but naively applying SWA to FA-pretrained models causes severe performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch.

Method: Proposes Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA) with five practical methods: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving "sink" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning.

Result: SWA adaptation is feasible but non-trivial: no single method suffices, but specific synergistic combinations effectively recover original long-context performance. The paper analyzes performance-efficiency trade-offs and provides recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: FA-pretrained LLMs can be successfully adapted to SWA without pretraining using carefully designed SWAA recipes, offering efficient long-context inference while maintaining performance.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving "sink" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

### [10] [Cooperative Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Question Answering: Mutual Information Exchange and Ranking by Contrasting Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10422)
*Youmin Ko,Sungjong Seo,Hyunjoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoopRAG is a novel retrieval-augmented generation framework where retriever and LLM cooperate through knowledge exchange, and retriever layers cooperate to rank documents, achieving state-of-the-art performance on QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods for question answering still suffer from incorrect retrievals and hallucinations, despite being designed to mitigate LLMs' factual inaccuracies. There's a need for better coordination between retrieval and generation components.

Method: CoopRAG features cooperative work between retriever and LLM through knowledge exchange, and between retriever layers for document ranking. The framework: (1) unrolls questions into sub-questions with masked reasoning chains, (2) retrieves documents using augmented queries, (3) reranks documents by contrasting retriever layers, and (4) reconstructs reasoning chains by filling masked positions via LLM.

Result: CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets and one simple QA dataset, achieving superior performance in both retrieval and QA metrics.

Conclusion: The cooperative framework between retriever and LLM, and between retriever layers, effectively addresses limitations of existing RAG methods, leading to improved performance on both simple and multi-hop question answering tasks.

Abstract: Since large language models (LLMs) have a tendency to generate factually inaccurate output, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained significant attention as a key means to mitigate this downside of harnessing only LLMs. However, existing RAG methods for simple and multi-hop question answering (QA) are still prone to incorrect retrievals and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances. Our code is available.\footnote{https://github.com/meaningful96/CoopRAG}

*Agniva Maiti,Prajwal Panth,Suresh Chandra Satapathy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRAP framework detects adversarial plagiarism using semantic reconstruction to recover original terminology from obfuscated scientific text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific integrity is threatened by automated paraphrasing tools that generate "tortured phrases" to mask plagiarism. Existing detection methods fail with novel obfuscations and can't identify source documents.

Method: Two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection using SciBERT with token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using FAISS for dense vector retrieval and SBERT for sentence alignment.

Result: Achieves 23.67% restoration accuracy vs. 0.00% for zero-shot baselines. Shows static decision boundaries outperform dynamic thresholding in scientific text. Enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated phrases to source documents.

Conclusion: SRAP provides effective detection and source recovery for adversarial plagiarism in scientific literature, addressing limitations of existing methods through semantic reconstruction.

Abstract: The integrity and reliability of scientific literature is facing a serious threat by adversarial text generation techniques, specifically from the use of automated paraphrasing tools to mask plagiarism. These tools generate "tortured phrases", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. "counterfeit consciousness" for "artificial intelligence"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance. SRAP enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents.

TL;DR: A multimodal AI system combining LLMs, KG-BERT, and LSTM with attention to classify students' cognitive/affective states in real-time, improving learning outcomes and emotional well-being.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a conversational agent that addresses both learning performance and emotional well-being in education, overcoming limitations of prior chatbots that focus only on tutoring OR affective support.

Method: Combines Large Language Models (LLMs), knowledge graph-enhanced BERT (KG-BERT), and bidirectional LSTM with attention to analyze multimodal data (text semantics, prosodic speech features, temporal behavioral trends) for real-time classification of engagement, stress, and conceptual understanding.

Result: Pilot study with university students showed improved motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic gains compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Integration of semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling shows promise for adaptive, student-centered educational interventions that support both cognitive and affective needs.

Abstract: This paper presents a psychologically-aware conversational agent designed to enhance both learning performance and emotional well-being in educational settings. The system combines Large Language Models (LLMs), a knowledge graph-enhanced BERT (KG-BERT), and a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with attention to classify students' cognitive and affective states in real time. Unlike prior chatbots limited to either tutoring or affective support, our approach leverages multimodal data-including textual semantics, prosodic speech features, and temporal behavioral trends-to infer engagement, stress, and conceptual understanding. A pilot study with university students demonstrated improved motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic gains compared to baseline methods. These results underline the promise of integrating semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling to support adaptive, student-centered educational interventions.

*Lars G. B. Johnsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs trained only on surface forms can distinguish grammatical vs ungrammatical syntactic constructions, suggesting they develop implicit sensitivity to hierarchical structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether large language models, trained only on surface forms without explicit syntactic knowledge, can reproduce systematic grammaticality contrasts that traditionally serve as evidence for hierarchical syntactic structure in generative grammar.

Method: Focus on two classic syntactic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion (testing subject boundary recognition) and parasitic gap licensing (testing abstract dependency structure). Evaluate models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 using prompts eliciting acceptability ratings for grammatical vs ungrammatical variants.

Result: LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants in both constructions, showing sensitivity to structure beyond just linear order. Models support structural generalizations distinct from cognitive knowledge.

Conclusion: Structural generalizations emerge from predictive training on surface forms, suggesting LLMs develop functional sensitivity to syntax without explicit encoding of grammatical rules.

Abstract: What counts as evidence for syntactic structure? In traditional generative grammar, systematic contrasts in grammaticality such as subject-auxiliary inversion and the licensing of parasitic gaps are taken as evidence for an internal, hierarchical grammar. In this paper, we test whether large language models (LLMs), trained only on surface forms, reproduce these contrasts in ways that imply an underlying structural representation.

### [16] [XDoGE: Multilingual Data Reweighting to Enhance Language Inclusivity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10545)
*Iñaki Lacunza,José Javier Saiz,Alexander Shvets,Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre,Marta Villegas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes XDoGE algorithm to optimize language distribution for multilingual LLMs, addressing over-reliance on high-resource languages by reweighting data for mid/low-resource languages, and releases IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are trained primarily on high-resource languages (like English), which hampers their performance in mid- and low-resource languages. There's a need to improve multilingual capabilities by addressing language imbalance in training data.

Method: 1) Extend DoGE algorithm to XDoGE for multilingual setup to optimize language distribution using a small proxy model. 2) Rescale data and train full-size models with established language weights, either from scratch or via continual pre-training (CPT). 3) Experiment with Salamandra-2b on six languages with varying resource levels (English/Spanish high, Portuguese/Catalan mid, Galician/Basque low). 4) Investigate effects of data repetition for minor languages and under-sampling for dominant languages using IberoBench framework.

Result: Developed XDoGE algorithm for multilingual language distribution optimization and released IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model focused on Iberian languages and English, pretrained from scratch and improved via CPT with XDoGE weights.

Conclusion: The proposed XDoGE approach effectively addresses language imbalance in multilingual LLM training, enabling better performance across resource levels. The released IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model demonstrates practical application of this methodology for Iberian languages.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive amounts of text data, primarily from a few dominant languages. Studies suggest that this over-reliance on high-resource languages, such as English, hampers LLM performance in mid- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we propose to (i) optimize the language distribution by training a small proxy model within a domain-reweighing DoGE algorithm that we extend to XDoGE for a multilingual setup, and (ii) rescale the data and train a full-size model with the established language weights either from scratch or within a continual pre-training phase (CPT). We target six languages possessing a variety of geographic and intra- and inter-language-family relations, namely, English and Spanish (high-resource), Portuguese and Catalan (mid-resource), Galician and Basque (low-resource). We experiment with Salamandra-2b, which is a promising model for these languages. We investigate the effects of substantial data repetition on minor languages and under-sampling on dominant languages using the IberoBench framework for quantitative evaluation. Finally, we release a new promising IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model centering on Iberian languages and English that we pretrained from scratch and further improved using CPT with the XDoGE weights.

### [17] [Causal Reasoning Favors Encoders: On The Limits of Decoder-Only Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10561)
*Amartya Roy,Elamparithy M,Kripabandhu Ghosh,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,Adrian de Wynter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning; encoder/encoder-decoder models with fine-tuning outperform decoder-only models for cost-effective robust causal reasoning, especially at smaller scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The role and performance of in-context learning (ICL) in causal reasoning remains unclear, despite ICL underpinning recent LLM advances. Causal reasoning requires multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations could lead to misleading results.

Method: Compared fine-tuned versions of encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures with zero and few-shot ICL in both natural language and non-natural language scenarios. Evaluated their performance on causal reasoning tasks requiring multihop conjunctive reasoning.

Result: ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. Decoder-only models are brittle to distributional shifts, while fine-tuned encoder and encoder-decoder models generalize more robustly across tests, including non-natural language splits. Decoder-only architectures only match or surpass them at large scales.

Conclusion: For cost-effective, short-horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder-decoder architectures with targeted fine-tuning are preferable over decoder-only models, especially at smaller scales.

Abstract: In context learning (ICL) underpins recent advances in large language models (LLMs), although its role and performance in causal reasoning remains unclear. Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales. We conclude by noting that for cost effective, short horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder decoder architectures with targeted finetuning are preferable.

TL;DR: RoleRMBench: First systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, revealing gaps in existing models and proposing RoleRM with Continuous Implicit Preferences for better subjective alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models fail in subjective, open-ended domains like role play, struggling to capture nuanced persona-grounded human judgments. There's a need for specialized evaluation and improvement in these areas.

Method: 1) Created RoleRMBench benchmark covering 7 fine-grained capabilities for role-playing dialogue evaluation. 2) Proposed RoleRM reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies.

Result: Evaluation shows large gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, especially in narrative/stylistic dimensions. RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, with substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity.

Conclusion: Continuous preference representation and annotation consistency are crucial for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems. RoleRMBench establishes a foundation for improving reward modeling in role-playing and other subjective domains.

Abstract: Reward modeling has become a cornerstone of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet, when extended to subjective and open-ended domains such as role play, existing reward models exhibit severe degradation, struggling to capture nuanced and persona-grounded human judgments. To address this gap, we introduce RoleRMBench, the first systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, covering seven fine-grained capabilities from narrative management to role consistency and engagement. Evaluation on RoleRMBench reveals large and consistent gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, particularly in narrative and stylistic dimensions. We further propose RoleRM, a reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies. Comprehensive experiments show that RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, demonstrating substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity. Our findings highlight the importance of continuous preference representation and annotation consistency, establishing a foundation for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems.

TL;DR: AgriGPT-Omni is an agricultural omni-framework integrating speech, vision, and text to address multilingual and multimodal challenges in agriculture through data synthesis, unified model training, and comprehensive benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural AI applications face three key constraints: lack of multilingual speech data, absence of unified multimodal architectures, and missing comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for agricultural tasks.

Method: 1) Construct scalable data synthesis pipeline converting agricultural texts/images to training data; 2) Train agricultural omni-model via three-stage paradigm (textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, GRPO-based RL); 3) Create AgriBench-Omni-2K tri-modal benchmark with standardized protocols.

Result: Created largest agricultural speech dataset (492K synthetic + 1.4K real samples across 6 languages); AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual/multimodal reasoning and real-world speech understanding.

Conclusion: AgriGPT-Omni addresses critical gaps in agricultural AI through unified multimodal framework, comprehensive data synthesis, and standardized evaluation, promoting reproducible research and inclusive agricultural intelligence for low-resource regions.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the lack of multilingual speech data, unified multimodal architectures, and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. To address these challenges, we present AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural omni-framework that integrates speech, vision, and text in a unified framework. First, we construct a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline that converts agricultural texts and images into training data, resulting in the largest agricultural speech dataset to date, including 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples across six languages. Second, based on this, we train the first agricultural omni-model via a three-stage paradigm: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, enabling unified reasoning across languages and modalities. Third, we propose AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark for agriculture, covering diverse speech-vision-text tasks and multilingual slices, with standardized protocols and reproducible tools. Experiments show that AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding. All models, data, benchmarks, and code will be released to promote reproducible research, inclusive agricultural intelligence, and sustainable AI development for low-resource regions.

### [20] [From Data Scarcity to Data Care: Reimagining Language Technologies for Serbian and other Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10630)
*Smiljana Antonijevic Ubois*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines challenges in developing language technologies for low-resource languages like Serbian, revealing how historical destruction, contemporary engineering-first approaches, and reliance on English-trained models create cultural and linguistic biases. It proposes a Data Care framework based on CARE principles to build more inclusive and culturally grounded language technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that large language models are predominantly trained on dominant languages like English, leading to cultural and linguistic biases in their representation of low-resource languages. Using Serbian as a case study, the authors aim to understand the structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors that shape language technology development for such languages in the AI age.

Method: The study employs qualitative research methods, conducting semi-structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners including linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers. This approach allows for tracing challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage and contemporary issues driving reductive, engineering-first approaches.

Result: The research identifies several key challenges: historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage, superficial transliteration practices, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. These factors lead to language technologies that prioritize functionality over linguistic nuance and reproduce existing power imbalances.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by proposing Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics). This framework reframes bias mitigation from a post-hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, offering a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies.

Abstract: Large language models are commonly trained on dominant languages like English, and their representation of low resource languages typically reflects cultural and linguistic biases present in the source language materials. Using the Serbian language as a case, this study examines the structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors shaping language technology development for low resource languages in the AI age. Drawing on semi structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners, including linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers, it traces challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage, intensified by contemporary issues that drive reductive, engineering first approaches prioritizing functionality over linguistic nuance. These include superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. To address these challenges, the study proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), that reframes bias mitigation from a post hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, and positions Data Care as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces existing power imbalances and cultural blind spots.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a comprehensive pipeline for detecting and mitigating two types of data bias (representation bias and explicit stereotypes) in LLM training data, with evaluation showing successful data debiasing but inconsistent model bias reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulations like the European AI Act require bias mitigation against protected groups, but practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. There's a need for systematic approaches to identify and mitigate biases in LLM training data to prevent unfair model outputs.

Method: Four-component pipeline: 1) LLM-generated word lists for group label detection, 2) Demographic Representation Score for quantifying representation bias, 3) Sociolinguistically informed filtering for stereotype detection/mitigation, 4) Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation for representation bias compensation. Evaluated on gender, religion, and age attributes.

Result: Successfully reduces representation bias and explicit stereotypes in text datasets through human validation and baseline comparison. However, LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data show inconsistent improvement on bias benchmarks, revealing gaps in current evaluation methodologies.

Conclusion: While the pipeline effectively debiases data, data debiasing alone doesn't consistently reduce model bias, highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation and improved evaluation methods to address manifested model bias.

Abstract: Textual data used to train large language models (LLMs) exhibits multifaceted bias manifestations encompassing harmful language and skewed demographic distributions. Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.

TL;DR: OPV (Outcome-based Process Verifier) combines outcome and process verification to efficiently detect errors in long reasoning chains, using active learning and expert annotations to reduce labeling costs while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current verifiers have limitations: outcome-based verifiers (OVs) can't inspect unreliable intermediate steps in long reasoning chains, while process-based verifiers (PVs) struggle with reliable error detection due to high annotation costs and scarcity of high-quality training data.

Method: Proposes OPV that verifies rationale process from summarized outcomes of long CoTs. Uses iterative active learning with expert annotations, where most uncertain cases are annotated and used to train new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR in each iteration.

Result: Achieves SOTA results on their benchmark (F1 score 83.1 vs 76.3 for Qwen3-Max-Preview). Effectively detects false positives in synthetic datasets and aligns with expert assessment. When collaborating with policy models, significantly improves performance (e.g., raising DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B accuracy from 55.2% to 73.3% on AIME2025).

Conclusion: OPV provides accurate and efficient verification for long reasoning chains, enabling large-scale annotation with reduced costs, and demonstrates superior performance and broad applicability across various benchmarks and model collaborations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in solving complex reasoning tasks by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \textbf{O}utcome-based \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out \textsc{\thisbench}, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3. Furthermore, OPV effectively detects false positives within synthetic dataset, closely align with expert assessment. When collaborating with policy models, OPV consistently yields performance gains, e.g., raising the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 55.2\% to 73.3\% on AIME2025 as the compute budget scales.

### [23] [TRIDENT: A Redundant Architecture for Caribbean-Accented Emergency Speech Triage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10741)
*Elroy Galbraith,Chadwick Sutherland,Donahue Morgan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRIDENT is a three-layer dispatcher-support system for Caribbean emergency calls that uses accent-tuned ASR, LLM entity extraction, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide structured inputs for human triage protocols when ASR fails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency speech recognition systems show systematic performance degradation on non-standard English varieties, creating critical service gaps for Caribbean populations who need equitable access to established national triage protocols.

Method: Three-layer architecture: 1) Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR with transcription confidence signals, 2) local entity extraction via large language models for structured clinical information, 3) bio-acoustic distress detection for vocal stress indicators. Key insight: low ASR confidence serves as queue prioritization signal when combined with vocal distress markers.

Result: The paper presents a theoretical framework and architectural design for accent-resilient emergency AI, grounded in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching. The system enables dispatchers to apply established triage protocols (ESI for routine, START for mass casualty) even when ASR fails. Empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work.

Conclusion: TRIDENT establishes a framework for equitable emergency response that ensures Caribbean voices receive access to established national triage protocols by treating ASR limitations as valuable signals rather than failures, combining multiple complementary data streams for dispatcher decision support.

Abstract: Emergency speech recognition systems exhibit systematic performance degradation on non-standard English varieties, creating a critical gap in services for Caribbean populations. We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.
  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.
  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios. This work establishes a framework for accent-resilient emergency AI that ensures Caribbean voices receive equitable access to established national triage protocols. Empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Scaling English base models is more data-efficient for language adaptation than continued pretraining, reduces catastrophic forgetting, and enables better model merging for multilingual systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual models underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially for medium- and lower-resource languages at smaller scales. Need efficient strategies to adapt pretrained models to new languages while preserving original capabilities.

Method: Comprehensive scaling ablations with FLOP-matched models, comparing upscaling English base models vs. standard continued pretraining. Testing whether larger models can adapt more efficiently with less target-language data. Exploring merging of scaled language-specific models to build multilingual systems.

Result: Larger upscaled models match/surpass smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, showing scaling benefits for data efficiency. Scaling reduces catastrophic forgetting of English capabilities. Merging scaled models performs better than smaller merges but still less effective than joint multilingual training, with large performance differences across merging methods.

Conclusion: Scaling is an effective strategy for language adaptation, offering data efficiency and reduced forgetting. Model merging shows promise for modular multilingual systems but needs specialized approaches for language-level integration to reach joint training effectiveness.

Abstract: Achieving high-performing language models which include medium- and lower-resource languages remains a challenge. Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones. We observe large performance differences across merging methods, suggesting potential for improvement through merging approaches specialized for language-level integration.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show significant performance degradation (5-12 F1 points) when processing romanized Indian language text vs native scripts in maternal healthcare triage, potentially causing millions of errors in real-world deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes clinical applications in India where speakers often use romanized text instead of native scripts, but existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation with real-world data.

Method: Benchmarked leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali, comparing performance between romanized and native script inputs in maternal and newborn healthcare triage.

Result: Consistent performance degradation for romanized messages (5-12 F1 points lower than native scripts), potentially causing nearly 2 million excess triage errors at partner organizations. LLMs can infer semantic intent but classification outputs remain brittle to orthographic noise.

Conclusion: Reveals a critical safety blind spot: LLMs that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably, highlighting the need for better handling of orthographic variations in clinical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes clinical applications in India. In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably.

TL;DR: The FACTS Leaderboard is a comprehensive benchmark suite that evaluates language models' factuality across four scenarios: multimodal image questions, parametric knowledge, search-based information seeking, and document-grounded long-form responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a holistic, robust evaluation of language models' ability to generate factually accurate text across diverse real-world scenarios, addressing the need for comprehensive factuality assessment beyond single metrics.

Method: Creates a leaderboard suite with four sub-leaderboards: FACTS Multimodal (image-based questions), FACTS Parametric (closed-book factoid questions), FACTS Search (search API usage), and FACTS Grounding v2 (document-grounded long-form responses). Uses automated judge models to score responses and averages the four components for final suite score.

Result: Developed an actively maintained online leaderboard suite with public/private splits, available at https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks/google/facts, providing balanced assessment of model factuality across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The FACTS Leaderboard Suite offers comprehensive, automated evaluation of language model factuality across multiple dimensions, enabling robust comparison while maintaining integrity through public/private splits.

Abstract: We introduce The FACTS Leaderboard, an online leaderboard suite and associated set of benchmarks that comprehensively evaluates the ability of language models to generate factually accurate text across diverse scenarios. The suite provides a holistic measure of factuality by aggregating the performance of models on four distinct sub-leaderboards: (1) FACTS Multimodal, which measures the factuality of responses to image-based questions; (2) FACTS Parametric, which assesses models' world knowledge by answering closed-book factoid questions from internal parameters; (3) FACTS Search, which evaluates factuality in information-seeking scenarios, where the model must use a search API; and (4) FACTS Grounding (v2), which evaluates whether long-form responses are grounded in provided documents, featuring significantly improved judge models. Each sub-leaderboard employs automated judge models to score model responses, and the final suite score is an average of the four components, designed to provide a robust and balanced assessment of a model's overall factuality. The FACTS Leaderboard Suite will be actively maintained, containing both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding its integrity.

*Michael Schlee,Christoph Weisser,Timo Kivimäki,Melchizedek Mashiku,Benjamin Saefken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LabelFusion is an ensemble method that combines transformer-based classifiers with LLMs for text classification, using a fusion MLP to integrate embeddings and LLM scores for accurate, cost-aware predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage complementary strengths of traditional transformer classifiers and LLMs for robust text classification while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.

Method: Concatenates transformer embeddings with LLM-derived per-class scores (from structured prompt engineering), then feeds this joint representation into a compact multi-layer perceptron (FusionMLP) for final prediction.

Result: Achieves 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification, demonstrating robust performance across domains.

Conclusion: LabelFusion provides an effective fusion ensemble that captures complementary strengths of different model types, offering a practical solution for accurate and cost-aware text classification.

Abstract: LabelFusion is a fusion ensemble for text classification that learns to combine a traditional transformer-based classifier (e.g., RoBERTa) with one or more Large Language Models (LLMs such as OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or DeepSeek) to deliver accurate and cost-aware predictions across multi-class and multi-label tasks. The package provides a simple high-level interface (AutoFusionClassifier) that trains the full pipeline end-to-end with minimal configuration, and a flexible API for advanced users. Under the hood, LabelFusion integrates vector signals from both sources by concatenating the ML backbone's embeddings with the LLM-derived per-class scores -- obtained through structured prompt-engineering strategies -- and feeds this joint representation into a compact multi-layer perceptron (FusionMLP) that produces the final prediction. This learned fusion approach captures complementary strengths of LLM reasoning and traditional transformer-based classifiers, yielding robust performance across domains -- achieving 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification -- while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.

### [29] [Quantifying Emotional Tone in Tolkien's The Hobbit: Dialogue Sentiment Analysis with RegEx, NRC-VAD, and Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10865)
*Lilin Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Computational analysis of emotional tone in Tolkien's The Hobbit reveals a generally positive, calm dialogue with increasing agency, showing how tension and comfort cycles shape the story's emotional rhythm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the emotional structure of dialogue in Tolkien's The Hobbit using computational methods to uncover subtle emotional patterns and rhythms in the storytelling.

Method: Extracted dialogue using regular expressions, preprocessed text, and scored emotional dimensions using the NRC-VAD lexicon to quantify valence, arousal, and dominance.

Result: Dialogue maintains positive valence and low arousal (calm tone) with gradually increasing agency/dominance; emotional trajectory shows cycles between tension and comfort through humor and camaraderie.

Conclusion: Computational text analysis combined with literary interpretation can reveal subtle emotional structures in literature, demonstrating how Tolkien's emotional modulation shapes The Hobbit's storytelling rhythm.

Abstract: This study analyzes the emotional tone of dialogue in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit (1937) using computational text analysis. Dialogue was extracted with regular expressions, then preprocessed, and scored using the NRC-VAD lexicon to quantify emotional dimensions. The results show that the dialogue maintains a generally positive (high valence) and calm (low arousal) tone, with a gradually increasing sense of agency (dominance) as the story progresses. These patterns reflect the novel's emotional rhythm: moments of danger and excitement are regularly balanced by humor, camaraderie, and relief. Visualizations -- including emotional trajectory graphs and word clouds -- highlight how Tolkien's language cycles between tension and comfort. By combining computational tools with literary interpretation, this study demonstrates how digital methods can uncover subtle emotional structures in literature, revealing the steady rhythm and emotional modulation that shape the storytelling in The Hobbit.

### [30] [Computational emotion analysis with multimodal LLMs: Current evidence on an emerging methodological opportunity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10882)
*Hauke Licht*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal AI shows promise for emotion analysis in politics but has limitations in real-world settings - works well under ideal conditions but fails in actual parliamentary debates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in video-based emotion analysis for political communication, addressing the gap in evidence about their performance despite their promising potential.

Method: Evaluated current multimodal LLMs using two complementary datasets of human-labeled video recordings: one under ideal circumstances and another with real-world parliamentary debate recordings.

Result: Under ideal conditions, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable with minimal demographic bias. However, in real-world parliamentary debates, their arousal ratings fail to deliver accurate results, potentially affecting downstream statistical inferences.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and provides a replicable framework for such evaluations.

Abstract: Emotions are central to politics and analyzing their role in political communication has a long tradition. As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze the display of emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative AI promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about the effectiveness of multimodal AI in emotion analysis. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in video-based analysis of emotional arousal in two complementary data sets of human-labeled video recordings. I find that under ideal circumstances, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable and show little to know indication of demographic bias. However, in recordings of speakers in real-world parliamentary debates, mLLMs' arousal ratings fail to deliver on this promise with potential negative consequences for downstream statistical inferences. This study therefore underscores the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and contributes a suitable replicable framework.

### [31] [Neuromorphic Eye Tracking for Low-Latency Pupil Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09969)
*Paul Hueber,Luca Peres,Florian Pitters,Alejandro Gloriani,Oliver Rhodes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neuromorphic SNN eye-tracking models achieve near-state-of-the-art accuracy (3.7-4.1px error) with 20x smaller models and 850x less compute than ANNs, enabling 3.9-4.9 mW power and 3 ms latency for wearable AR/VR applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable eye tracking for AR/VR requires low latency and milliwatt-level power, but conventional frame-based approaches suffer from motion blur, high compute cost, and limited temporal resolution. Neuromorphic sensors and SNNs offer promise but existing SNN approaches are either too specialized or underperform compared to modern ANNs.

Method: Developed neuromorphic versions of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models by replacing recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire) layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity.

Result: Models achieved 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching Retina's 3.24px accuracy (application-specific neuromorphic system). Reduced model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x compared to closest ANN variant. Projected to operate at 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz.

Conclusion: High-performing event-based eye-tracking architectures can be successfully redesigned as SNNs with substantial efficiency gains while maintaining accuracy suitable for real-time wearable deployment in AR/VR applications.

Abstract: Eye tracking for wearable systems demands low latency and milliwatt-level power, but conventional frame-based pipelines struggle with motion blur, high compute cost, and limited temporal resolution. Such capabilities are vital for enabling seamless and responsive interaction in emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), where understanding user gaze is key to immersion and interface design. Neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative, yet existing SNN approaches are either too specialized or fall short of the performance of modern ANN architectures. This paper presents a neuromorphic version of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models, replacing their recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity. Our models obtain 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the accuracy of the application-specific neuromorphic system, Retina (3.24px), while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x, compared to the closest ANN variant of the proposed model. These efficient variants are projected to operate at an estimated 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz. The present results indicate that high-performing event-based eye-tracking architectures can be redesigned as SNNs with substantial efficiency gains, while retaining accuracy suitable for real-time wearable deployment.

### [32] [ABBSPO: Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling and Symmetric Prior based Orientation Prediction for Detecting Aerial Image Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10031)
*Woojin Lee,Hyugjae Chang,Jaeho Moon,Jaehyup Lee,Munchurl Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABBSPO is a weakly supervised oriented object detection framework that improves scale estimation using adaptive bounding box scaling and leverages object symmetry for self-supervised angle prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous HBox-supervised OOD methods directly compare GT horizontal boxes with predicted rotated boxes' circumscribed rectangles, leading to inaccurate scale estimation. Also, existing methods suffer from learning collapse when predictions for all augmented views are consistently wrong.

Method: Proposes two key components: (1) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS) that appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for each predicted RBox size, and (2) Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits aerial object symmetry for self-supervised learning to prevent learning collapse.

Result: Extensive experiments show ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing weakly supervised oriented object detection methods.

Conclusion: ABBSPO effectively addresses scale estimation inaccuracies and learning collapse issues in previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, providing a robust framework for weakly supervised oriented object detection.

Abstract: Weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing both efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.

### [33] [Diffusion Is Your Friend in Show, Suggest and Tell](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10038)
*Jia Cheng Hu,Roberto Cavicchioli,Alessandro Capotondi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SST combines diffusion models with autoregressive generation for image captioning, using diffusion to suggest improvements to autoregressive captions, achieving SOTA on COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have shown promise in CV but underperform autoregressive models in discrete domains like language. The authors want to leverage diffusion's bidirectional/refining capabilities while maintaining autoregressive models' strong linguistic structure.

Method: Show, Suggest and Tell (SST) - uses diffusion models to provide suggestions to autoregressive generation rather than replacing it. Combines bidirectional refinement of diffusion with linguistic structure of autoregressive models.

Result: Achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on COCO without RL, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion SOTA by 1.5 and 2.5 points. Extensive experiments show positive correlation between suggestion quality and caption quality.

Conclusion: Combining diffusion suggestions with autoregressive generation is a promising underexplored direction that yields SOTA results, demonstrating the value of hybrid approaches over pure diffusion or autoregressive methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Denoising models demonstrated impressive results across generative Computer Vision tasks, but they still fail to outperform standard autoregressive solutions in the discrete domain, and only match them at best. In this work, we propose a different paradigm by adopting diffusion models to provide suggestions to the autoregressive generation rather than replacing them. By doing so, we combine the bidirectional and refining capabilities of the former with the strong linguistic structure provided by the latter. To showcase its effectiveness, we present Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), which achieves State-of-the-Art results on COCO, among models in a similar setting. In particular, SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on the COCO dataset without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model State-of-the-Art results by 1.5 and 2.5 points. On top of the strong results, we performed extensive experiments to validate the proposal and analyze the impact of the suggestion module. Results demonstrate a positive correlation between suggestion and caption quality, overall indicating a currently underexplored but promising research direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaVoxel is a joint diffusion model that learns the complete distribution over brain MRI scans and clinical metadata, enabling unified zero-shot inference for multiple medical AI tasks without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for medical imaging are typically trained for specific predictive tasks with fixed input-output directions, requiring separate models for different applications. This limits flexibility and clinical applicability.

Method: MetaVoxel uses a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that learns a single diffusion process spanning all variables (imaging data and clinical metadata). It models the joint distribution rather than conditional distributions, enabling flexible inference.

Result: A single MetaVoxel model trained on >10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans with clinical metadata from nine datasets performs image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction with performance comparable to established task-specific baselines.

Conclusion: Joint multimodal diffusion modeling offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models, enabling flexible zero-shot inference and broader clinical applicability without task-specific retraining.

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods have achieved impressive results across tasks from disease classification, estimating continuous biomarkers, to generating realistic medical images. Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference.Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.

*Jiahao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Independent Density Estimation (IDE) method for compositional generalization in vision-language models by learning connections between individual words and image features, with two model variants and entropy-based inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale vision-language models struggle with compositional generalization despite success in tasks like image captioning and generation. Current models lack human-like ability to generalize to unseen compositions of concepts.

Method: Independent Density Estimation (IDE) learns connections between individual words and corresponding image features. Two models: 1) uses fully disentangled visual representations, 2) uses Variational Auto-Encoder for partially disentangled features from raw images. Also proposes entropy-based compositional inference to combine word predictions.

Result: Models demonstrate superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models across various datasets.

Conclusion: IDE approach effectively addresses compositional generalization challenge in vision-language models through disentangled feature learning and entropy-based inference, enabling better handling of novel concept combinations.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language models have achieved remarkable results in various domains, such as image captioning and conditioned image generation. Nevertheless, these models still encounter difficulties in achieving human-like compositional generalization. In this study, we propose a new method called Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to tackle this challenge. IDE aims to learn the connection between individual words in a sentence and the corresponding features in an image, enabling compositional generalization. We build two models based on the philosophy of IDE. The first one utilizes fully disentangled visual representations as input, and the second leverages a Variational Auto-Encoder to obtain partially disentangled features from raw images. Additionally, we propose an entropy-based compositional inference method to combine predictions of each word in the sentence. Our models exhibit superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models when evaluated on various datasets.

Motivation: The paper addresses two key challenges in rendering dynamic specular scenes: precise reflection direction estimation and physically accurate reflection modeling, which are difficult for existing methods to handle effectively.

Method: Proposes Residual Material-Augmented 2D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic geometry/material modeling, Dynamic Environment Gaussian, and a hybrid rendering pipeline that decomposes rendering into diffuse/specular components using rasterization and ray tracing with coarse-to-fine training.

Conclusion: TraceFlow successfully addresses the challenges of dynamic specular scene rendering through its novel representation and hybrid rendering approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality and physical accuracy.

Abstract: We present TraceFlow, a novel framework for high-fidelity rendering of dynamic specular scenes by addressing two key challenges: precise reflection direction estimation and physically accurate reflection modeling. To achieve this, we propose a Residual Material-Augmented 2D Gaussian Splatting representation that models dynamic geometry and material properties, allowing accurate reflection ray computation. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Environment Gaussian and a hybrid rendering pipeline that decomposes rendering into diffuse and specular components, enabling physically grounded specular synthesis via rasterization and ray tracing. Finally, we devise a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve optimization stability and promote physically meaningful decomposition. Extensive experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks demonstrate that TraceFlow outperforms prior methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, producing sharper and more realistic specular reflections in complex dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tracking tasks focus on flat instance tracking without considering hierarchical relationships between objects and their parts. There's a need to track instances while maintaining their part-whole relationships, which is important for understanding complex scenes and object compositions.

Method: Introduces a new hierarchical instance tracking task and creates the first benchmark dataset for it. The dataset contains 2,765 unique entities tracked across 552 videos, belonging to 40 categories spanning both objects and parts. Seven variants of four different models are evaluated on this dataset.

Result: Evaluation shows the new dataset is challenging for current models, indicating that hierarchical instance tracking is a difficult problem that existing approaches struggle with. The dataset is publicly available for research use.

Conclusion: Hierarchical instance tracking is a novel and challenging computer vision task that requires tracking objects and their parts while maintaining hierarchical relationships. The proposed benchmark dataset provides a foundation for future research in this area, highlighting the limitations of current tracking models.

Abstract: We propose a novel task, hierarchical instance tracking, which entails tracking all instances of predefined categories of objects and parts, while maintaining their hierarchical relationships. We introduce the first benchmark dataset supporting this task, consisting of 2,765 unique entities that are tracked in 552 videos and belong to 40 categories (across objects and parts).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using topological data analysis (wavelet persistence) to improve breast cancer detection model generalization across different mammography scanners and populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer screening suffers from false positives/negatives and model performance degradation when deployed across different scanners, modalities, and patient populations.

Method: Propose wavelet-based vectorization of persistent homology to create stable spatial multi-scale maps of image structure. Integrate these topological maps into a two-stage detection pipeline via input channel concatenation.

Result: On INbreast dataset, augmenting ConvNeXt Tiny with wavelet persistence channels increased patient-level AUC from 0.55 to 0.75 under limited training budget. Model trained on US CBIS DDSM and evaluated on Portuguese (INbreast) and Chinese (CMMD) datasets.

Conclusion: Topological data analysis through wavelet persistence provides effective conditioning signals that improve model generalization across different mammography systems and populations.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Screening mammography reduces mortality, yet interpretation still suffers from substantial false negatives and false positives, and model accuracy often degrades when deployed across scanners, modalities, and patient populations. We propose a simple conditioning signal aimed at improving external performance based on a wavelet based vectorization of persistent homology. Using topological data analysis, we summarize image structure that persists across intensity thresholds and convert this information into spatial, multi scale maps that are provably stable to small intensity perturbations. These maps are integrated into a two stage detection pipeline through input level channel concatenation. The model is trained and validated on the CBIS DDSM digitized film mammography cohort from the United States and evaluated on two independent full field digital mammography cohorts from Portugal (INbreast) and China (CMMD), with performance reported at the patient level. On INbreast, augmenting ConvNeXt Tiny with wavelet persistence channels increases patient level AUC from 0.55 to 0.75 under a limited training budget.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FCTM (Feature Coding Test Model) achieves ~85% bitrate reduction for compressing DNN intermediate features, enabling efficient edge-cloud split inference while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are compute-heavy for edge deployment; full on-device or cloud-only inference have latency/bandwidth/privacy trade-offs; edge-cloud split inference needs efficient feature compression to reduce bandwidth overhead.

Method: MPEG's FCM standard defines bitstream syntax and codec pipeline for compressing intermediate features; FCTM implements this standard with optimized compression techniques.

Result: FCTM achieves average 85.14% bitrate reduction across multiple vision tasks while maintaining accuracy, enabling efficient edge-cloud split inference.

Conclusion: FCM/FCTM provides scalable, interoperable solution for bandwidth-limited, privacy-sensitive applications requiring intelligent feature deployment.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) drive modern machine vision but are challenging to deploy on edge devices due to high compute demands. Traditional approaches-running the full model on-device or offloading to the cloud face trade-offs in latency, bandwidth, and privacy. Splitting the inference workload between the edge and the cloud offers a balanced solution, but transmitting intermediate features to enable such splitting introduces new bandwidth challenges. To address this, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) initiated the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, establishing a bitstream syntax and codec pipeline tailored for compressing intermediate features. This paper presents the design and performance of the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), showing significant bitrate reductions-averaging 85.14%-across multiple vision tasks while preserving accuracy. FCM offers a scalable path for efficient and interoperable deployment of intelligent features in bandwidth-limited and privacy-sensitive consumer applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCDrive introduces latent chain-of-thought reasoning for autonomous driving, using action-aligned latent tokens instead of natural language to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models use natural language for chain-of-thought reasoning, but text may not be the most efficient representation for driving decision-making. There's a need for more efficient reasoning representations that better align with driving actions.

Method: Proposes Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive) that uses latent language for reasoning: (1) action-proposal tokens using the same vocabulary as output actions, and (2) world model tokens grounded in learned latent world models representing future outcomes. Uses cold-start supervision with ground-truth future rollouts, then post-trains with closed-loop reinforcement learning.

Result: On large-scale end-to-end driving benchmarks, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.

Conclusion: Latent chain-of-thought reasoning in action-aligned spaces is more effective than natural language reasoning for autonomous driving, offering better performance, efficiency, and reinforcement learning improvements.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving explore inference-time reasoning as a way to improve driving performance and safety in challenging scenarios. Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FCM (Feature Coding for Machines) compresses neural features instead of pixels for machine-to-machine communication, reducing bandwidth, preserving privacy, and maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while enabling use of existing codec hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine-to-machine systems inefficiently stream pixel-based video using human-optimized codecs, consuming excessive bandwidth, scaling poorly, and exposing raw images to third parties.

Method: FCM compresses intermediate neural features rather than pixels, using H.26X codecs as inner codecs. The approach compares H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC performance for machine tasks.

Result: FCM maintains accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. HEVC and VVC achieve nearly identical machine task performance (1.39% BD-Rate increase when replacing VVC with HEVC), while AVC performs worse (32.28% BD-Rate increase). For tracking tasks, codec choice has minimal impact, with HEVC even outperforming VVC.

Conclusion: Existing hardware for deployed codecs (particularly HEVC) can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance, making FCM a practical solution for bandwidth-efficient, privacy-preserving machine-to-machine systems.

Abstract: Machines are increasingly becoming the primary consumers of visual data, yet most deployments of machine-to-machine systems still rely on remote inference where pixel-based video is streamed using codecs optimized for human perception. Consequently, this paradigm is bandwidth intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. Recent efforts in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) redesigned the pipeline for machine-to-machine communication: Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is designed to apply task-aware coding tools in the pixel domain, and Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) is designed to compress intermediate neural features to reduce bitrate, preserve privacy, and support compute offload. Experiments show that FCM is capable of maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. Additional analysis of H.26X codecs used as inner codecs in FCM reveals that H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) achieve almost identical machine task performance, with an average BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when VVC is replaced with HEVC. In contrast, H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) yields an average BD-Rate increase of 32.28% compared to VVC. However, for the tracking task, the impact of codec choice is minimal, with HEVC outperforming VVC and achieving BD Rate of -1.81% and 8.79% for AVC, indicating that existing hardware for already deployed codecs can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance.

*Jiho Jang,Jinyoung Kim,Kyungjune Baek,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCDPO addresses reward conflicts in DPO for diffusion models by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective with conditional training, enabling independent optimization across multiple reward dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DPO formulation has a fundamental limitation: it aggregates diverse evaluation axes (aesthetic quality, semantic alignment) into a single scalar reward using Bradley-Terry model, creating reward conflicts where desirable features in specific dimensions get unlearned if they appear in globally non-preferred samples.

Method: Proposes Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO) with disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. Introduces preference outcome vector as a condition during training, allowing independent optimization for each reward axis within a single network. Uses dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions.

Result: Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL show MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks. The conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.

Conclusion: MCDPO effectively resolves reward conflicts in DPO-based diffusion model alignment, enabling independent optimization across multiple reward dimensions and providing flexible control at inference time without requiring additional training or external reward models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback has emerged as a standard for aligning diffusion models. However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks. Notably, our conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.

*Tian Liu,Anwesha Basu,James Caverlee,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWIFT enables effective semi-supervised few-shot learning by addressing VLM's flat probability distributions through classifier initialization and temperature tuning, achieving performance close to supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSFSL methods neglect powerful open-source Vision-Language Models and their pretraining data, despite their potential for real-world auto-annotation applications. Existing SSL methods fail when applied to VLMs due to flat probability distributions.

Method: Proposes SWIFT: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning. Uses classifier initialization and temperature tuning to increase pseudo-label confidence, then applies SSL methods to finetune VLMs on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and noisy task-relevant data from pretraining sets.

Result: SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by ~5 accuracy points on five SSFSL benchmarks. It even rivals supervised learning that uses ground truth labels for unlabeled data.

Conclusion: Simple techniques (classifier initialization and temperature tuning) can effectively address VLM's flat probability distributions, enabling successful SSFSL with open-source resources. SWIFT demonstrates practical viability for real-world auto-annotation applications.

Abstract: Semi-supervised few-shot learning (SSFSL) formulates real-world applications like ''auto-annotation'', as it aims to learn a model over a few labeled and abundant unlabeled examples to annotate the unlabeled ones. Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\sim$5 accuracy points. SWIFT even rivals supervised learning, which finetunes VLMs with the unlabeled data being labeled with ground truth!

TL;DR: RobustSora benchmark evaluates how watermark manipulation affects AIGC video detection performance, revealing 2-8pp variations across models and highlighting partial watermark dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGC video detection benchmarks overlook that many generative models embed digital watermarks, and detectors may rely on these patterns, creating a need to evaluate watermark robustness in detection systems.

Method: Created RobustSora benchmark with 6,500 videos in four categories: Authentic-Clean, Authentic-Spoofed (with fake watermarks), Generated-Watermarked, and Generated-DeWatermarked. Evaluated ten models across two tasks: Task-I tests detection on watermark-removed AI videos, Task-II assesses false alarms on authentic videos with fake watermarks.

Result: Performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp), indicating partial watermark dependency in current detectors.

Conclusion: Watermark manipulation significantly affects AIGC video detection performance, highlighting the need for watermark-aware training strategies. RobustSora provides essential tools to advance robust AIGC detection research.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated video technologies poses challenges to information integrity. While recent benchmarks advance AIGC video detection, they overlook a critical factor: many state-of-the-art generative models embed digital watermarks in outputs, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns. To evaluate this influence, we present RobustSora, the benchmark designed to assess watermark robustness in AIGC video detection. We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp). These findings indicate partial watermark dependency and highlight the need for watermark-aware training strategies. RobustSora provides essential tools to advance robust AIGC detection research.

TL;DR: THE-Pose introduces a category-level 6D pose estimation framework that uses topological priors and hybrid graph fusion to overcome limitations of 3D graph convolution methods, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D graph convolution methods for category-level object pose estimation focus only on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. They lack global context needed to handle intra-class variations effectively.

Method: THE-Pose leverages topological priors via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. It extracts consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, then uses a Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module to adaptively integrate these topological features with point-cloud features, bridging 2D image context and 3D geometric structure.

Result: On the REAL275 dataset, THE-Pose achieves a 35.8% improvement over the 3D-GC baseline (HS-Pose) and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 7.2% across all key metrics. The framework shows robustness for unseen or complicated objects even under significant occlusions.

Conclusion: THE-Pose demonstrates that incorporating topological priors and hybrid fusion of 2D image context with 3D geometric structure significantly improves category-level 6D pose estimation, overcoming limitations of purely local 3D graph convolution approaches.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation requires both global context and local structure to ensure robustness against intra-class variations. However, 3D graph convolution (3D-GC) methods only focus on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. To address this, we present THE-Pose, a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework that leverages a topological prior via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. Specifically, we extract consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, effectively overcoming the limitations inherent in existing 3D-GC based methods. Our Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module adaptively integrates the topological features with point-cloud features, seamlessly bridging 2D image context and 3D geometric structure. These fused features ensure stability for unseen or complicated objects, even under significant occlusions. Extensive experiments on the REAL275 dataset show that THE-Pose achieves a 35.8% improvement over the 3D-GC baseline (HS-Pose) and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 7.2% across all key metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cardiac chamber segmentation in echocardiography is crucial for clinical diagnosis, but existing methods struggle with balancing long-range spatiotemporal dependency capture, computational efficiency, and fine-grained feature representation while dealing with noise, artifacts, and heart motion.

Method: GDKVM architecture with three key components: 1) Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) for modeling inter-frame correlations, 2) Gated Delta Rule (GDR) for efficient intermediate memory state storage, and 3) Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module for integrating local and global features at multiple scales to handle boundary blurring and noise.

Conclusion: GDKVM provides an effective solution for echocardiography video segmentation that balances accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, making it suitable for clinical applications requiring real-time analysis.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac chambers in echocardiography sequences is crucial for the quantitative analysis of cardiac function, aiding in clinical diagnosis and treatment. The imaging noise, artifacts, and the deformation and motion of the heart pose challenges to segmentation algorithms. While existing methods based on convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and space-time memory networks have improved segmentation accuracy, they often struggle with the trade-off between capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and maintaining computational efficiency with fine-grained feature representation. In this paper, we introduce GDKVM, a novel architecture for echocardiography video segmentation. The model employs Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) to effectively model inter-frame correlations, and introduces Gated Delta Rule (GDR) to efficiently store intermediate memory states. Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module is designed to integrate local and global features at multiple scales, enhancing robustness against boundary blurring and noise interference. We validated GDKVM on two mainstream echocardiography video datasets (CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic) and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-NCD: A multimodal framework that fuses visual-textual semantics and prototype-guided clustering to discover novel classes, achieving 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes with unique resilience to long-tail distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Novel Class Discovery (NCD) methods for images rely on visual features which have limitations: insufficient feature discriminability and vulnerability to long-tail data distributions. There's a need for more robust approaches that can leverage multimodal information.

Method: LLM-NCD fuses visual-textual semantics with prototype-guided clustering. Key innovations: 1) Modeling cluster centers and semantic prototypes of known classes by jointly optimizing known class image and text features, 2) A dual-phase discovery mechanism that dynamically separates known/novel samples via semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering.

Result: On CIFAR-100 dataset, achieves up to 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes compared to current methods. Notably demonstrates unique resilience to long-tail distributions - a first in NCD literature.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion of visual-textual semantics with prototype-guided clustering significantly improves Novel Class Discovery performance, particularly addressing limitations of visual-only approaches and showing robustness to challenging data distributions like long-tail scenarios.

Abstract: Novel Class Discovery aims to utilise prior knowledge of known classes to classify and discover unknown classes from unlabelled data. Existing NCD methods for images primarily rely on visual features, which suffer from limitations such as insufficient feature discriminability and the long-tail distribution of data. We propose LLM-NCD, a multimodal framework that breaks this bottleneck by fusing visual-textual semantics and prototype guided clustering. Our key innovation lies in modelling cluster centres and semantic prototypes of known classes by jointly optimising known class image and text features, and a dualphase discovery mechanism that dynamically separates known or novel samples via semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering. Experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset show that compared to the current methods, this method achieves up to 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes. Notably, our method shows unique resilience to long tail distributions, a first in NCD literature.

### [48] [Long-LRM++: Preserving Fine Details in Feed-Forward Wide-Coverage Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10267)
*Chen Ziwen,Hao Tan,Peng Wang,Zexiang Xu,Li Fuxin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Long-LRM++ improves 3D scene reconstruction by combining implicit representation benefits with real-time rendering, achieving 14 FPS while matching state-of-the-art quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods face trade-offs: Gaussian splatting (Long-LRM) is error-sensitive and produces blurry fine details, while implicit representations (LVSM, LaCT) have high fidelity but require computationally intensive decompression that prevents real-time rendering. The paper aims to retain implicit representation benefits while enabling real-time performance.

Method: Long-LRM++ uses a semi-explicit scene representation combined with a lightweight decoder. It scales to 64 input views at 950×540 resolution, overcoming the speed limitations of prior implicit methods by avoiding deep sequential decompression processes.

Result: Achieves real-time 14 FPS rendering on A100 GPU while matching LaCT's rendering quality on DL3DV. Scales to 64 input views, shows strong generalization to increased input lengths, and delivers superior novel-view depth prediction on ScanNetv2 compared to direct depth rendering from Gaussians.

Conclusion: The semi-explicit representation with lightweight decoder successfully bridges the gap between high-fidelity implicit methods and real-time rendering, demonstrating that deep sequential decompression is not necessary for achieving both quality and speed in 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent advances in generalizable Gaussian splatting (GS) have enabled feed-forward reconstruction of scenes from tens of input views. Long-LRM notably scales this paradigm to 32 input images at $950\times540$ resolution, achieving 360° scene-level reconstruction in a single forward pass. However, directly predicting millions of Gaussian parameters at once remains highly error-sensitive: small inaccuracies in positions or other attributes lead to noticeable blurring, particularly in fine structures such as text. In parallel, implicit representation methods such as LVSM and LaCT have demonstrated significantly higher rendering fidelity by compressing scene information into model weights rather than explicit Gaussians, and decoding RGB frames using the full transformer or TTT backbone. However, this computationally intensive decompression process for every rendered frame makes real-time rendering infeasible. These observations raise key questions: Is the deep, sequential "decompression" process necessary? Can we retain the benefits of implicit representations while enabling real-time performance? We address these questions with Long-LRM++, a model that adopts a semi-explicit scene representation combined with a lightweight decoder. Long-LRM++ matches the rendering quality of LaCT on DL3DV while achieving real-time 14 FPS rendering on an A100 GPU, overcoming the speed limitations of prior implicit methods. Our design also scales to 64 input views at the $950\times540$ resolution, demonstrating strong generalization to increased input lengths. Additionally, Long-LRM++ delivers superior novel-view depth prediction on ScanNetv2 compared to direct depth rendering from Gaussians. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed framework.

### [49] [Sample-wise Adaptive Weighting for Transfer Consistency in Adversarial Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10275)
*Hongsin Lee,Hye Won Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stronger robust teachers don't always produce more robust students due to robust saturation. The paper identifies adversarial transferability as key and proposes SAAD, which reweights training examples by transferability without extra cost, improving robustness over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial distillation methods often don't use state-of-the-art robust teachers, and stronger teachers don't necessarily yield more robust students (robust saturation phenomenon). While typically attributed to capacity gaps, this explanation is incomplete. The paper aims to understand the true factors affecting robustness transfer in adversarial distillation.

Method: The paper proposes Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which identifies adversarial transferability (fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against the teacher) as key factor. SAAD reweights training examples by their measured transferability without incurring additional computational cost.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods. The method effectively addresses the robust saturation problem by focusing on transferable adversarial examples.

Conclusion: Adversarial transferability is a crucial factor for successful robustness transfer in adversarial distillation, not just capacity gaps. SAAD provides an effective, computationally efficient solution that improves robustness transfer by adaptively reweighting examples based on transferability.

Abstract: Adversarial distillation in the standard min-max adversarial training framework aims to transfer adversarial robustness from a large, robust teacher network to a compact student. However, existing work often neglects to incorporate state-of-the-art robust teachers. Through extensive analysis, we find that stronger teachers do not necessarily yield more robust students-a phenomenon known as robust saturation. While typically attributed to capacity gaps, we show that such explanations are incomplete. Instead, we identify adversarial transferability-the fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against the teacher-as a key factor in successful robustness transfer. Based on this insight, we propose Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which reweights training examples by their measured transferability without incurring additional computational cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HongsinLee/saad.

TL;DR: MotionEdit introduces a motion-centric image editing dataset and benchmark, showing current models struggle with motion editing, then proposes MotionNFT framework to improve motion fidelity without sacrificing general editing ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing datasets focus on static appearance changes or have sparse, low-quality motion edits. Motion-centric editing is scientifically challenging and practically significant for applications like frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.

Method: 1) Create MotionEdit dataset with high-fidelity image pairs from continuous videos showing realistic motion transformations. 2) Develop MotionEdit-Bench benchmark with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. 3) Propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning) framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on ground-truth motion flow.

Result: Benchmark results show motion editing remains highly challenging for state-of-the-art diffusion models. MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity for FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit models without sacrificing general editing ability.

Conclusion: MotionEdit addresses the gap in motion-centric image editing, providing a valuable dataset and benchmark while demonstrating MotionNFT's effectiveness in improving motion transformation accuracy for diffusion-based editing models.

Abstract: We introduce MotionEdit, a novel dataset for motion-centric image editing-the task of modifying subject actions and interactions while preserving identity, structure, and physical plausibility. Unlike existing image editing datasets that focus on static appearance changes or contain only sparse, low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs depicting realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos. This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.
  To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations. Extensive experiments on FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit show that MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity of both base models on the motion editing task without sacrificing general editing ability, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: ShotDirector: A framework for controllable multi-shot video generation that integrates camera control and editing-pattern-aware prompting to achieve film-like shot transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods focus on low-level visual consistency but neglect intentional film-editing patterns and cinematographic language, leading to mere sequential shot changes without coherent narrative expression.

Method: Proposes ShotDirector with two key components: 1) Camera control module using 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings for precise camera information injection, and 2) Shot-aware mask mechanism with hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns for fine-grained content control.

Result: Creates ShotWeaver40K dataset capturing film-like editing pattern priors, develops evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation, and demonstrates effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance to achieve film-like controllable shot transitions, addressing the limitations of current video generation approaches.

Abstract: Shot transitions play a pivotal role in multi-shot video generation, as they determine the overall narrative expression and the directorial design of visual storytelling. However, recent progress has primarily focused on low-level visual consistency across shots, neglecting how transitions are designed and how cinematographic language contributes to coherent narrative expression. This often leads to mere sequential shot changes without intentional film-editing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose ShotDirector, an efficient framework that integrates parameter-level camera control and hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting. Specifically, we adopt a camera control module that incorporates 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings to enable precise camera information injection. In addition, a shot-aware mask mechanism is employed to introduce hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, allowing fine-grained control over shot content. Through this design, our framework effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance, achieving film-like controllable shot transitions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we construct ShotWeaver40K, a dataset that captures the priors of film-like editing patterns, and develop a set of evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

*Karthikeya KV,Narendra Bandaru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Disentangled360 is a 3D-aware framework for 360° view synthesis that disentangles isotropic/anisotropic light behavior using Gaussian Splatting, enabling medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction without scene-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across different contexts (medical imaging vs. natural scenes). There's a need for a unified framework that can handle both volumetric medical data and real-world RGB scenes while maintaining structural realism.

Method: 1. Uses Gaussian Splatting backbone with disentangled isotropic/anisotropic contributions. 2. Dual-branch conditioning: one for CT intensity scattering in volumetric data, another for real-world RGB scenes via normalized camera embeddings. 3. Hybrid pose-agnostic anchoring method for adaptive depth/material sampling. 4. Integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into single inference pipeline.

Result: Superior SSIM and LPIPS performance on Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets. Runtime assessments confirm viability for interactive applications. Enables rapid, photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality.

Conclusion: Disentangled360 facilitates mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation without requiring scene-specific fine-tuning or expensive photon simulations, offering a generalizable solution for both medical and natural scene applications.

Abstract: We introduce Disentangled360, an innovative 3D-aware technology that integrates the advantages of direction disentangled volume rendering with single-image 360° unique view synthesis for applications in medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction. In contrast to current techniques that either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across various contexts, our framework distinctly differentiates between isotropic and anisotropic contributions inside a Gaussian Splatting backbone. We implement a dual-branch conditioning framework, one optimized for CT intensity driven scattering in volumetric data and the other for real-world RGB scenes through normalized camera embeddings. To address scale ambiguity and maintain structural realism, we present a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method that adaptively samples scene depth and material transitions, functioning as stable pivots during scene distillation. Our design integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a singular inference pipeline, facilitating rapid, photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality. Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets indicate superior SSIM and LPIPS performance, while runtime assessments confirm its viability for interactive applications. Disentangled360 facilitates mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation, eliminating the necessity for scene-specific finetuning or expensive photon simulations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient-VLN reduces training overhead in Vision-Language Navigation by using progressive/recursive memory mechanisms and dynamic mixed policy, achieving SOTA performance with 282 GPU hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs for VLN face high training overhead from (1) quadratic computation from long historical observations as token sequences, and (2) exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger data collection.

Method: Progressive memory (dynamic token allocation to recent observations), learnable recursive memory (key-value cache of learnable tokens as memory state), and dynamic mixed policy to balance exploration-efficiency trade-off.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR) with only 282 H800 GPU hours, dramatically reducing training overhead compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: Efficient-VLN successfully addresses training efficiency challenges in VLN while maintaining high performance, making MLLM-based VLN more practical for development.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN). However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR).

Motivation: Current WSSS methods in histopathology are limited by inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and region-shrinkage effects from CAM-based supervision, creating a need for better region discovery under weak supervision.

Method: Proposes a dual-modal prototype bank combining CoOp-style learnable text prompts (text prototypes) with learnable image prototypes, enhanced by a multi-scale pyramid module to address ViT oversmoothing and improve spatial precision.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on BCSS-WSSS benchmark, with analyses showing benefits of text description diversity, context length, and complementary behavior of text and image prototypes.

Conclusion: Jointly leveraging textual semantics and visual prototype learning is effective for WSSS in digital pathology, demonstrating the value of vision-language alignment for improving region discovery under weak supervision.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology seeks to reduce annotation cost by learning from image-level labels, yet it remains limited by inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and the region-shrinkage effect of CAM-based supervision. We propose a simple and effective prototype-driven framework that leverages vision-language alignment to improve region discovery under weak supervision. Our method integrates CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning to generate text-based prototypes and combines them with learnable image prototypes, forming a dual-modal prototype bank that captures both semantic and appearance cues. To address oversmoothing in ViT representations, we incorporate a multi-scale pyramid module that enhances spatial precision and improves localization quality. Experiments on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark show that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, and detailed analyses demonstrate the benefits of text description diversity, context length, and the complementary behavior of text and image prototypes. These results highlight the effectiveness of jointly leveraging textual semantics and visual prototype learning for WSSS in digital pathology.

TL;DR: A prototype learning framework for weakly supervised semantic segmentation in histopathology that combines vision-language model representations (CONCH), segmentation backbone features (SegFormer), and text guidance to generate high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSSS methods in histopathology rely on classification backbones that only localize discriminative regions and fail to capture full spatial extent of tissue structures. There's a need to combine complementary strengths of vision-language models (rich semantic alignment) and modern segmentation backbones (fine-grained spatial cues) under weak supervision without dense annotations.

Method: Proposes a prototype learning framework that integrates: 1) morphology-aware representations from CONCH vision-language model, 2) multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer segmentation backbone, and 3) text-guided semantic alignment. Uses text-guided prototype initialization with pathology descriptions for complete pseudo-masks, and structural distillation to transfer spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve morphological patterns and tissue boundaries.

Result: The approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types. Experiments on BCSS-WSSS datasets show it outperforms existing WSSS methods while remaining computationally efficient through frozen foundation model backbones and lightweight trainable adapters.

Conclusion: The proposed prototype learning framework effectively combines complementary strengths of vision-language models and segmentation backbones for WSSS in histopathology, achieving superior performance through semantic discriminability and spatial coherence without requiring dense annotations.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology relies heavily on classification backbones, yet these models often localize only the most discriminative regions and struggle to capture the full spatial extent of tissue structures. Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types. Experiments on BCSS-WSSS datasets demonstrate that our prototype learning framework outperforms existing WSSS methods while remaining computationally efficient through frozen foundation model backbones and lightweight trainable adapters.

Motivation: 3D human pose estimation faces challenges from complex human body geometry, self-occluding joints, and the need for large-scale real-world motion datasets.

Method: Point2Pose uses a spatio-temporal point cloud encoder and pose feature encoder to extract joint-wise features, followed by an attention-based generative regressor to model pose distributions conditioned on sequential point clouds and pose history.

Conclusion: Point2Pose effectively addresses 3D human pose estimation challenges through generative modeling and is supported by the new MVPose3D dataset containing multi-modal data (IMU, point clouds, RGB images).

Abstract: We propose a novel generative approach for 3D human pose estimation. 3D human pose estimation poses several key challenges due to the complex geometry of the human body, self-occluding joints, and the requirement for large-scale real-world motion datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce Point2Pose, a framework that effectively models the distribution of human poses conditioned on sequential point cloud and pose history.

### [57] [EchoingPixels: Cross-Modal Adaptive Token Reduction for Efficient Audio-Visual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10324)
*Chao Gong,Depeng Wang,Zhipeng Wei,Ya Guo,Huijia Zhu,Jingjing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingPixels is an audio-visual token reduction framework that uses cross-modal interaction to dynamically reduce tokens from a combined audio-visual pool, achieving 5-20% token usage with 2-3x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-Visual LLMs face computational overhead from massive audio/video tokens. Existing unimodal token reduction methods can't leverage audio-visual synergies, and static per-modality budgets are suboptimal due to dynamic information densities. Joint audio-visual token reduction remains an unaddressed bottleneck.

Method: Introduces EchoingPixels with Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2) for early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from a combined pool. Uses Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to preserve temporal relationships for sparsely selected tokens.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of original tokens, with 2-3x speedup and memory reduction. Demonstrates effective joint audio-visual token reduction while maintaining temporal modeling capability.

Conclusion: EchoingPixels successfully addresses the audio-visual token reduction bottleneck by leveraging cross-modal synergies and dynamic token allocation, enabling efficient AV-LLMs with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) face prohibitive computational overhead from massive audio and video tokens. Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoingPixels achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of the original tokens, with a 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.

TL;DR: StainNet is a specialized pathology foundation model for special stains (like immunohistochemistry) using vision transformers, trained on 1.4M patches from 20K+ WSIs via self-distillation SSL, outperforming H&E-trained models on special stain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pathology foundation models are mainly pre-trained on H&E-stained images, limiting their effectiveness for clinical applications involving special stains like immunohistochemistry, which are frequently used in practice.

Method: Propose StainNet, a vision transformer-based foundation model using self-distillation SSL, trained on over 1.4 million patch images from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance on slide-level liver malignancy classification and two public ROI-level datasets, shows effectiveness in few-ratio learning and retrieval tasks, and compares favorably with larger PFMs.

Conclusion: StainNet addresses the limitation of H&E-trained PFMs for special stains and provides a specialized foundation model that performs well on special stain pathology tasks, with model weights publicly released.

Abstract: Foundation models trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale histological images have significantly accelerated the development of computational pathology. These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths. We have released the StainNet model weights at: https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet.

*Cai Xu,Jinlong Liu,Yilin Zhang,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISMVC selectively imputes missing multi-view data based on informativeness, using a VAE with mixture-of-Gaussians prior for robust clustering, outperforming both imputation-based and imputation-free methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for incomplete multi-view clustering have limitations: imputation-based methods introduce noise when information is insufficient, while imputation-free methods struggle with severe incompleteness due to lack of cross-view complementarity.

Method: ISMVC evaluates imputation-relevant informativeness of each missing position using intra-view similarity and cross-view consistency, selectively imputes only when sufficient support exists, and integrates this with a VAE using mixture-of-Gaussians prior for distribution-level imputation that models uncertainty.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets under realistic unbalanced missing scenarios show ISMVC outperforms both imputation-based and imputation-free approaches.

Conclusion: ISMVC provides a lightweight, data-driven, model-agnostic solution that can be integrated as a plug-in module into existing incomplete multi-view clustering models, offering robust performance through selective imputation and uncertainty modeling.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where different views suffer from missing and unbalanced observations, pose significant challenges for clustering. Existing imputation-based methods attempt to estimate missing views to restore data associations, but indiscriminate imputation often introduces noise and bias, especially when the available information is insufficient. Imputation-free methods avoid this risk by relying solely on observed data, but struggle under severe incompleteness due to the lack of cross-view complementarity. To address this issue, we propose Informativeness-based Selective imputation Multi-View Clustering (ISMVC). Our method evaluates the imputation-relevant informativeness of each missing position based on intra-view similarity and cross-view consistency, and selectively imputes only when sufficient support is available. Furthermore, we integrate this selection with a variational autoencoder equipped with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior to learn clustering-friendly latent representations. By performing distribution-level imputation, ISMVC not only stabilizes the aggregation of posterior distributions but also explicitly models imputation uncertainty, enabling robust fusion and preventing overconfident reconstructions. Compared with existing cautious imputation strategies that depend on training dynamics or model feedback, our method is lightweight, data-driven, and model-agnostic. It can be readily integrated into existing IMC models as a plug-in module. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets under a more realistic and challenging unbalanced missing scenario demonstrate that our method outperforms both imputation-based and imputation-free approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Filament segmentation is crucial for biological analysis but suffers from data shortage due to the extreme difficulty and time-consuming nature of manual pixel-level annotation for dense, geometrically complex filamentous structures like microtubules and actin filaments.

Method: Uses a conditional generative framework based on Pix2Pix architecture to generate realistic filament microscopy images from binary masks. Introduces a novel filament-aware structural loss to improve structural similarity in synthetic image generation.

Result: The approach demonstrates effectiveness and outperforms existing models trained without synthetic data, showing improved performance in filament segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed conditional generative framework with filament-aware structural loss successfully addresses the data shortage problem for filament segmentation, enabling more effective deep learning models for biological image analysis.

Abstract: Thin and elongated filamentous structures, such as microtubules and actin filaments, often play important roles in biological systems. Segmenting these filaments in biological images is a fundamental step for quantitative analysis. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of filament segmentation. However, there is a big challenge in acquiring high quality pixel-level annotated dataset for filamentous structures, as the dense distribution and geometric properties of filaments making manual annotation extremely laborious and time-consuming. To address the data shortage problem, we propose a conditional generative framework based on the Pix2Pix architecture to generate realistic filaments in microscopy images from binary masks. We also propose a filament-aware structural loss to improve the structure similarity when generating synthetic images. Our experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach and outperformed existing model trained without synthetic data.

TL;DR: HD-CLIP is a plug-and-play module that decomposes low-quality images into semantic and ordinal degradation embeddings to guide diffusion models for real-world super-resolution, improving detail fidelity without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image super-resolution faces challenges with unknown, complex degradations. Existing methods assume known degradation severity and use CLIP text encoders that can't capture numerical severity, limiting generalization to diverse real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes HD-CLIP (Hierarchical Degradation CLIP) that decomposes low-quality images into semantic embedding and ordinal degradation embedding capturing ordered relationships. Integrated into diffusion models via classifier-free guidance and proposed classifier-free projection guidance (CFPG). Uses semantic cues for generative restoration and degradation cues to suppress hallucinations.

Result: HD-CLIP can be seamlessly integrated into various super-resolution frameworks without training, significantly improving detail fidelity and perceptual realism across diverse real-world datasets.

Conclusion: HD-CLIP addresses limitations of existing methods by providing richer degradation guidance for diffusion models, enabling better generalization to real-world super-resolution tasks with unknown degradations.

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) aims to recover high-quality images from low-quality inputs degraded by unknown and complex real-world factors. Real-world scenarios involve diverse and coupled degradations, making it necessary to provide diffusion models with richer and more informative guidance. However, existing methods often assume known degradation severity and rely on CLIP text encoders that cannot capture numerical severity, limiting their generalization ability. To address this, we propose \textbf{HD-CLIP} (\textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{D}egradation CLIP), which decomposes a low-quality image into a semantic embedding and an ordinal degradation embedding that captures ordered relationships and allows interpolation across unseen levels. Furthermore, we integrated it into diffusion models via classifier-free guidance (CFG) and proposed classifier-free projection guidance (CFPG). HD-CLIP leverages semantic cues to guide generative restoration while using degradation cues to suppress undesired hallucinations and artifacts. As a \textbf{plug-and-play module}, HD-CLIP can be seamlessly integrated into various super-resolution frameworks without training, significantly improving detail fidelity and perceptual realism across diverse real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSPlan benchmark evaluates VLMs on error-prone visual sequential planning with error detection and step completion tasks. VLMs struggle despite advanced reasoning techniques, but the proposed SGI method improves performance by 5.2% through intermediate reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale VLMs have strong reasoning capabilities but haven't been properly evaluated for visual sequential planning, especially in scenarios with non-optimal/erroneous steps. There's a need to assess VLMs' ability to detect and correct errors in multi-step action sequences toward goals.

Method: Proposes CoSPlan benchmark with 4 domains (maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction, object reorganization) to evaluate Error Detection and Step Completion. Also introduces Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), a training-free method that adds intermediate reasoning steps between initial and goal states to help VLMs reason about sequences.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs (Intern-VLM, Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan even with Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs. SGI method yields average performance gain of 5.2% and also generalizes to traditional planning tasks like Plan-Bench and VQA.

Conclusion: VLMs have limitations in error-prone sequential planning despite advanced reasoning techniques. The SGI method effectively improves performance by introducing intermediate reasoning steps, demonstrating potential for enhancing reliability in corrective sequential planning tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive complex reasoning capabilities but remain largely unexplored in visual sequential planning, i.e., executing multi-step actions towards a goal. Additionally, practical sequential planning often involves non-optimal (erroneous) steps, challenging VLMs to detect and correct such steps. We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals. Addressing this, we propose a novel training-free method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps between the initial and goal states. SGI helps VLMs reason about sequences, yielding an average performance gain of 5.2%. In addition to enhancing reliability in corrective sequential planning, SGI generalizes to traditional planning tasks such as Plan-Bench and VQA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion generation methods rely on fixed skeletal templates, limiting generalization to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. There's a lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks for arbitrary skeletal topologies with textual conditioning.

Method: Introduces OmniZoo dataset (140 species, 32,979 sequences with multimodal annotations) and a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework with Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric/structural properties of any skeleton into shared token space for fusion with textual semantics.

Result: Method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, semantically aligned motions given text prompts and target skeletons, and enables cross-species motion style transfer.

Conclusion: The approach addresses core limitations of current motion generation by providing both large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and a unified framework capable of modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies with textual conditions.

Abstract: Motion generation is fundamental to computer animation and widely used across entertainment, robotics, and virtual environments. While recent methods achieve impressive results, most rely on fixed skeletal templates, which prevent them from generalizing to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. We address the core limitation of current motion generation methods - the combined lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies and textual conditions. To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics. Given a text prompt and a target skeleton, our method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions, and further enables cross-species motion style transfer.

Conclusion: TranSamba successfully addresses the limitations of 2D approaches for volumetric medical segmentation by efficiently capturing 3D context through a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture, establishing new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation offers a label-efficient solution to train segmentation models for volumetric medical imaging. However, existing approaches often rely on 2D encoders that neglect the inherent volumetric nature of the data. We propose TranSamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture designed to capture 3D context for weakly supervised volumetric medical segmentation. TranSamba augments a standard Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks, which leverage the linear complexity of state space models for efficient information exchange across neighboring slices. The information exchange enhances the pairwise self-attention within slices computed by the Transformer blocks, directly contributing to the attention maps for object localization.

TL;DR: mmCounter uses mmWave radar to count static people in dense indoor spaces by detecting ultra-low frequency breathing and micro-movements, achieving accurate counting without prior knowledge of person count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mmWave radars struggle to detect or count individuals in dense, static groups due to spatial resolution limitations and reliance on movement for detection. Current breathing rate estimation methods assume the number of people is known beforehand.

Method: mmCounter extracts ultra-low frequency (<1 Hz) signals from breathing and micro-scale body movements, uses novel multi-stage signal processing to differentiate these subtle signals from background noise and nearby static objects, extracts relevant low-frequency sources with spatial information, and maps these sources to individual people.

Result: Achieves 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in untested environments. Can count up to 7 individuals in 3 square meters with no side-by-side spacing and only 1-meter front-to-back distance.

Conclusion: mmCounter enables accurate counting of static people in dense indoor spaces using mmWave radar by detecting subtle physiological signals, addressing limitations of existing approaches that require movement or prior knowledge of person count.

Abstract: mmWave radars struggle to detect or count individuals in dense, static (non-moving) groups due to limitations in spatial resolution and reliance on movement for detection. We present mmCounter, which accurately counts static people in dense indoor spaces (up to three people per square meter). mmCounter achieves this by extracting ultra-low frequency (< 1 Hz) signals, primarily from breathing and micro-scale body movements such as slight torso shifts, and applying novel signal processing techniques to differentiate these subtle signals from background noise and nearby static objects. Our problem differs significantly from existing studies on breathing rate estimation, which assume the number of people is known a priori. In contrast, mmCounter utilizes a novel multi-stage signal processing pipeline to extract relevant low-frequency sources along with their spatial information and map these sources to individual people, enabling accurate counting. Extensive evaluations in various environments demonstrate that mmCounter delivers an 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and a 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in previously untested environments. It can count up to seven individuals in a three square meter space, such that there is no side-by-side spacing and only a one-meter front-to-back distance.

Conclusion: The proposed Video Toolkit and STAR framework represent an important step toward building autonomous and intelligent video analysis assistants.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) task serves as a critical playground for evaluating whether foundation models can effectively perceive, understand, and reason about dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with simultaneously modeling spatial relationships within video frames and understanding the causal dynamics of temporal evolution on complex and reasoning-intensive VideoQA task. In this work, we equip MLLM with a comprehensive and extensible Video Toolkit, to enhance MLLM's spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities and ensure the harmony between the quantity and diversity of tools. To better control the tool invocation sequence and avoid toolchain shortcut issues, we propose a Spatiotemporal Reasoning Framework (STAR) that strategically schedules temporal and spatial tools, thereby progressively localizing the key area in the video. Our STAR framework enhances GPT-4o using lightweight tools, achieving an 8.2% gain on VideoMME and 4.6% on LongVideoBench.

TL;DR: Visual Funnel addresses MLLMs' contextual blindness by using hierarchical cropping based on attention entropy to preserve both fine details and global context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained visual perception despite good reasoning. Existing cropping methods cause "Contextual Blindness" - a disconnect between high-fidelity details from crops and global context from original images, limiting performance in precision tasks.

Method: Visual Funnel: training-free two-step approach. 1) Contextual Anchoring: identifies region of interest in single forward pass. 2) Entropy-Scaled Portfolio: constructs hierarchical crops from focal detail to broader surroundings by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers.

Result: Significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Adding more unstructured crops provides limited or detrimental benefits, confirming hierarchical structure is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.

Conclusion: The problem is not information quantity but structural diversity. Visual Funnel's hierarchical portfolio effectively addresses contextual blindness in MLLMs by preserving both detailed and contextual information through structured cropping.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, but often fail to perceive fine-grained visual details, limiting their applicability in precision-demanding tasks. While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: "Contextual Blindness". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.

*Mingyu Jeon,Jisoo Yang,Sungjin Han,Jinkwon Hwang,Sunjae Yoon,Jonghee Kim,Junyeoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P2S is a novel training-free framework for zero-shot long video moment retrieval that addresses inefficient search and costly refinement phases through adaptive span generation and query decomposition, outperforming supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for long video moment retrieval face limitations: supervised methods have poor scalability and generalization despite high resource costs, while zero-shot methods suffer from candidate explosion in search phases and require expensive VLM verification in refinement phases.

Method: P2S introduces two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Span Generator to prevent candidate explosion in the search phase, and (2) Query Decomposition to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification, making it a completely training-free framework.

Result: P2S is the first zero-shot framework capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming supervised state-of-the-art methods by significant margins (e.g., +3.7% on R5@0.1 on MAD dataset).

Conclusion: The proposed P2S framework successfully addresses the dual challenges of inefficient search and costly refinement in zero-shot long video moment retrieval, demonstrating superior performance over supervised methods without requiring task-specific training.

Abstract: Zero-shot Long Video Moment Retrieval (ZLVMR) is the task of identifying temporal segments in hour-long videos using a natural language query without task-specific training. The core technical challenge of LVMR stems from the computational infeasibility of processing entire lengthy videos in a single pass. This limitation has established a 'Search-then-Refine' approach, where candidates are rapidly narrowed down, and only those portions are analyzed, as the dominant paradigm for LVMR. However, existing approaches to this paradigm face severe limitations. Conventional supervised learning suffers from limited scalability and poor generalization, despite substantial resource consumption. Yet, existing zero-shot methods also fail, facing a dual challenge: (1) their heuristic strategies cause a 'search' phase candidate explosion, and (2) the 'refine' phase, which is vulnerable to semantic discrepancy, requires high-cost VLMs for verification, incurring significant computational overhead. We propose \textbf{P}oint-\textbf{to}-\textbf{S}pan (P2S), a novel training-free framework to overcome this challenge of inefficient 'search' and costly 'refine' phases. P2S overcomes these challenges with two key innovations: an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to prevent the search phase candidate explosion, and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification. To our knowledge, P2S is the first zero-shot framework capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming supervised state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin (e.g., +3.7\% on R5@0.1 on MAD).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoherentGS addresses the vicious cycle of sparse and blurry images in 3D Gaussian Splatting by using dual generative priors for deblurring and geometric completion, achieving state-of-the-art results with as few as 3-9 input views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS requires dense, high-quality images but real-world data is often sparse and motion-blurred, creating a vicious cycle where sparse views can't resolve blur and blur erases details needed for alignment, leading to catastrophic reconstruction failures.

Method: Dual-prior strategy combining: 1) specialized deblurring network for photometric guidance, 2) diffusion model for geometric priors to fill unobserved regions, plus consistency-guided camera exploration and depth regularization for geometric plausibility.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world scenes with as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views, setting new state-of-the-art for sparse and blurry image reconstruction.

Conclusion: CoherentGS successfully breaks the vicious cycle of sparse and blurry images in 3DGS through dual generative priors, enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from severely degraded input data.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a state-of-the-art method for novel view synthesis. However, its performance heavily relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, an assumption that is often violated in real-world applications, where data is typically sparse and motion-blurred. These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images. Our key insight is to address these compound degradations using a dual-prior strategy. Specifically, we combine two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model that offers geometric priors to fill in unobserved regions of the scene. This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility. We evaluate CoherentGS through both quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes, using as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views. Our results demonstrate that CoherentGS significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for this challenging task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR fusion, addressing radar noise/sparsity challenges with novel fusion module and loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar is cheaper and more weather-robust than LiDAR, with point-wise velocity detection, but radar-LiDAR fusion for scene flow estimation is unexplored. No existing dataset combines these modalities for this task, and radar data has noise, low resolution, and sparsity issues.

Method: Constructed Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset from public automotive data with preprocessing for radar denoising and flow label generation. Proposed RaLiFlow framework with Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module that integrates radar dynamic cues into local cross-attention, plus specialized loss functions to handle unreliable radar data and enhance instance-level consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods on the repurposed scene flow dataset.

Conclusion: The first successful radar-LiDAR fusion framework for scene flow estimation, demonstrating radar's value as a complementary sensor to LiDAR despite its challenges, with effective fusion through dynamic-aware cross-modal attention and specialized training strategies.

Abstract: Recent multimodal fusion methods, integrating images with LiDAR point clouds, have shown promise in scene flow estimation. However, the fusion of 4D millimeter wave radar and LiDAR remains unexplored. Unlike LiDAR, radar is cheaper, more robust in various weather conditions and can detect point-wise velocity, making it a valuable complement to LiDAR. However, radar inputs pose challenges due to noise, low resolution, and sparsity. Moreover, there is currently no dataset that combines LiDAR and radar data specifically for scene flow estimation. To address this gap, we construct a Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset based on a public real-world automotive dataset. We propose an effective preprocessing strategy for radar denoising and scene flow label generation, deriving more reliable flow ground truth for radar points out of the object boundaries. Additionally, we introduce RaLiFlow, the first joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR, which achieves effective radar-LiDAR fusion through a novel Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module and a carefully designed set of loss functions. The DBCF module integrates dynamic cues from radar into the local cross-attention mechanism, enabling the propagation of contextual information across modalities. Meanwhile, the proposed loss functions mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable radar data during training and enhance the instance-level consistency in scene flow predictions from both modalities, particularly for dynamic foreground areas. Extensive experiments on the repurposed scene flow dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods by a significant margin.

*Alberto Rota,Elena De Momi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised deep learning pipeline for establishing precise feature correspondences in endoscopic surgical images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on SCARED datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate spatial understanding is critical for image-guided surgery, AR integration, and context awareness. In minimally invasive procedures where visual input is the only intraoperative modality, establishing precise pixel-level correspondences between endoscopic frames is essential for 3D reconstruction, camera tracking, and scene interpretation. However, surgical domains present unique challenges: weak perspective cues, non-Lambertian tissue reflections, and complex deformable anatomy degrade conventional computer vision techniques. While deep learning models perform well in natural scenes, their features aren't inherently suited for fine-grained matching in surgical images and require domain-specific adaptation.

Method: The research presents a novel deep learning pipeline with a self-supervised optimization framework. The methodology leverages a novel-view synthesis pipeline to generate ground-truth inlier correspondences, which are then used for mining triplets within a contrastive learning paradigm. The approach augments the DINOv2 backbone with an additional Transformer layer specifically optimized to produce embeddings that enable direct matching through cosine similarity thresholding.

Result: Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art methodologies on the SCARED datasets, achieving improved matching precision and lower epipolar error compared to related work.

Conclusion: The proposed framework constitutes a valuable contribution toward enabling more accurate high-level computer vision applications in surgical endoscopy, addressing the unique challenges of the surgical domain through targeted adaptation of deep learning models.

Abstract: Accurate spatial understanding is essential for image-guided surgery, augmented reality integration and context awareness. In minimally invasive procedures, where visual input is the sole intraoperative modality, establishing precise pixel-level correspondences between endoscopic frames is critical for 3D reconstruction, camera tracking, and scene interpretation. However, the surgical domain presents distinct challenges: weak perspective cues, non-Lambertian tissue reflections, and complex, deformable anatomy degrade the performance of conventional computer vision techniques. While Deep Learning models have shown strong performance in natural scenes, their features are not inherently suited for fine-grained matching in surgical images and require targeted adaptation to meet the demands of this domain. This research presents a novel Deep Learning pipeline for establishing feature correspondences in endoscopic image pairs, alongside a self-supervised optimization framework for model training. The proposed methodology leverages a novel-view synthesis pipeline to generate ground-truth inlier correspondences, subsequently utilized for mining triplets within a contrastive learning paradigm. Through this self-supervised approach, we augment the DINOv2 backbone with an additional Transformer layer, specifically optimized to produce embeddings that facilitate direct matching through cosine similarity thresholding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLM benchmarks focus on reasoning tasks but neglect fine-grained recognition, which is crucial for practical applications. There's a need for better evaluation of detailed recognition capabilities.

Method: Proposes FROW benchmark for fine-grained recognition evaluation using GPT-4o. Introduces optimization strategy with two components: 1) mosaic data combining multiple short-answer responses, and 2) open-world data generated from real-world Q&A using GPT-4o. Also incorporates fine-grained data into pre-training phase.

Result: Mosaic data improves category recognition accuracy by 1%. Open-world data boosts FROW benchmark accuracy by 10-20% and content accuracy by 6-12%. Incorporating fine-grained data in pre-training improves category recognition accuracy by up to 10%.

Conclusion: The FROW benchmark addresses the gap in fine-grained recognition evaluation for LVLMs. The proposed optimization strategies effectively improve model performance on detailed recognition tasks, demonstrating the importance of specialized data construction and training approaches for practical LVLM applications.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable progress, enabling sophisticated vision-language interaction and dialogue applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on reasoning tasks, often neglecting fine-grained recognition, which is crucial for practical application scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Fine-grained Recognition Open World (FROW) benchmark, designed for detailed evaluation of LVLMs with GPT-4o. On the basis of that, we propose a novel optimization strategy from two perspectives: \textit{data construction} and \textit{training process}, to improve the performance of LVLMs. Our dataset includes mosaic data, which combines multiple short-answer responses, and open-world data, generated from real-world questions and answers using GPT-4o, creating a comprehensive framework for evaluating fine-grained recognition in LVLMs. Experiments show that mosaic data improves category recognition accuracy by 1\% and open-world data boosts FROW benchmark accuracy by 10\%-20\% and content accuracy by 6\%-12\%. Meanwhile, incorporating fine-grained data into the pre-training phase can improve the model's category recognition accuracy by up to 10\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method that achieves high accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR point clouds often contain noise that degrades object detection accuracy. Existing methods trade off between computational efficiency and denoising quality - either sacrificing speed for accuracy or losing edge details for speed.

Method: 1) Octree spatial partitioning for parallel acceleration; 2) Adaptive voxel occupancy statistics and kNN density estimation to remove isolated/low-density noise; 3) Gravitational scoring function combining density weights with adaptive distance weights to distinguish noise from object points.

Result: Experiments on Stanford 3D, CADC, and in-house FMCW LiDAR datasets show consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance across various noise conditions while reducing single-frame processing time.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios, addressing the trade-off between denoising quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: High-quality point cloud data is a critical foundation for tasks such as autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.

TL;DR: MultiHateLoc: A weakly-supervised framework for temporal localization of multimodal hate speech in videos using modality-aware encoders, dynamic cross-modal fusion, and contrastive alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of video content on platforms like TikTok and YouTube has intensified the spread of multimodal hate speech, where harmful cues emerge subtly and asynchronously across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research focuses only on video-level classification, leaving the crucial task of temporal localization largely unaddressed, especially under weak supervision where only video-level labels are available.

Method: MultiHateLoc incorporates: (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns with tailored text-based preprocessing; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasize the most informative modality at each moment, plus cross-modal contrastive alignment for feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision.

Result: Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip datasets show that MultiHateLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localization task, producing fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions despite relying solely on coarse video-level labels.

Conclusion: MultiHateLoc is the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localization, effectively addressing the challenge of identifying when hateful segments occur in videos by capturing cross-modal and temporal dynamics that static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle with.

Abstract: The rapid growth of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has intensified the spread of multimodal hate speech, where harmful cues emerge subtly and asynchronously across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision. Despite relying solely on coarse labels, MultiHateLoc produces fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions. Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localisation task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL has been effective for 2D image generation but remains unexplored for 3D due to higher spatial complexity requiring globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures, making 3D generation sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms.

Method: Systematic study across four dimensions: (1) Reward designs evaluating dimensions and model choices, (2) RL algorithms studying GRPO variants and token-level optimization, (3) Introducing MME-3DR benchmark for implicit reasoning abilities, (4) Proposing Hi-GRPO for hierarchical global-to-local optimization with reward ensembles.

Result: Developed AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model that excels from coarse shape to texture refinement, demonstrating effectiveness of token-level optimization and hierarchical RL approach.

Conclusion: This study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial and general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes, with hierarchical RL optimization being effective for 3D generation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation. Code is released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/3DGen-R1.

TL;DR: This paper introduces WildRoad dataset and MaGRoad model for off-road road network extraction, addressing domain gap and topological errors in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for vectorized road extraction work well in urban settings but fail in off-road environments due to domain gap, lack of large-scale datasets, and structural weaknesses in node-centric methods that are fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions.

Method: Two complementary approaches: 1) Release WildRoad dataset - a global off-road road network dataset created with a dedicated interactive annotation tool; 2) Introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor) - a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.

Result: MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. The streamlined pipeline yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability.

Conclusion: The combination of the WildRoad dataset and the path-centric paradigm provides a stronger foundation for mapping roads in wild terrains, addressing previous limitations in off-road road network extraction.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced vectorized road extraction in urban settings, yet off-road environments remain underexplored and challenging. A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a gloabal off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability. Together, the dataset and path-centric paradigm provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in the wild.

Conclusion: TransLocNet provides robust and generalizable aerial-ground localization that works effectively in both synthetic and real-world settings.

Abstract: Aerial-ground localization is difficult due to large viewpoint and modality gaps between ground-level LiDAR and overhead imagery. We propose TransLocNet, a cross-modal attention framework that fuses LiDAR geometry with aerial semantic context. LiDAR scans are projected into a bird's-eye-view representation and aligned with aerial features through bidirectional attention, followed by a likelihood map decoder that outputs spatial probability distributions over position and orientation. A contrastive learning module enforces a shared embedding space to improve cross-modal alignment. Experiments on CARLA and KITTI show that TransLocNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing localization error by up to 63% and achieving sub-meter, sub-degree accuracy. These results demonstrate that TransLocNet provides robust and generalizable aerial-ground localization in both synthetic and real-world settings.

TL;DR: NCTTA proposes a novel Test-Time Adaptation method based on Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), addressing performance degradation in domain shifts through feature-classifier alignment with hybrid targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods lack theoretical insights into why models degrade under domain shifts. The paper aims to understand the fundamental causes of performance degradation and develop a theoretically-grounded solution.

Method: Extends Neural Collapse to sample-wise level (NC3+), identifies misalignment as the root cause, and proposes NCTTA - a feature-classifier alignment method with hybrid targets that blends geometric proximity with predictive confidence to handle unreliable pseudo-labels.

Result: NCTTA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 14.52% improvement over Tent on ImageNet-C, demonstrating enhanced robustness to domain shifts across extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Sample-wise misalignment is the fundamental cause of TTA performance degradation under domain shifts, and NCTTA's feature-classifier alignment with hybrid targets effectively addresses this issue, providing both theoretical insights and practical improvements.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enhances model robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data by updating the model online during inference, yet existing methods lack theoretical insights into the fundamental causes of performance degradation under domain shifts. Recently, Neural Collapse (NC) has been proposed as an emergent geometric property of deep neural networks (DNNs), providing valuable insights for TTA. In this work, we extend NC to the sample-wise level and discover a novel phenomenon termed Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), demonstrating that a sample's feature embedding, obtained by a trained model, aligns closely with the corresponding classifier weight. Building on NC3+, we identify that the performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment in adaptation which exacerbates under larger distribution shifts. This indicates the necessity of realigning the feature embeddings with their corresponding classifier weights. However, the misalignment makes pseudo-labels unreliable under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose NCTTA, a novel feature-classifier alignment method with hybrid targets to mitigate the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels, which blends geometric proximity with predictive confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NCTTA in enhancing robustness to domain shifts. For example, NCTTA outperforms Tent by 14.52% on ImageNet-C.

Motivation: Enable remote physiotherapy supervision and m-health applications by providing real-time exercise identification, classification, and evaluation on mobile devices without server dependency.

Method: 1) Use pose-estimation neural network to extract body keypoints from camera input; 2) Transform keypoints into trigonometric angle-based features; 3) Apply lightweight supervised models for frame-level pose classification; 4) Use modified Levenshtein distance dynamic programming for full exercise sequence matching and deviation detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient, scalable solution for real-time physiotherapy exercise monitoring on mobile devices, suitable for m-health applications and remote patient supervision.

Abstract: This work presents an efficient algorithmic framework for real-time identification, classification, and evaluation of human physiotherapy exercises using mobile devices. The proposed method interprets a kinetic movement as a sequence of static poses, which are estimated from camera input using a pose-estimation neural network.

*Han Li,Shaohui Li,Wenrui Dai,Chenglin Li,Xinlong Pan,Haipeng Wang,Junni Zou,Hongkai Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified-transform video compression framework with dual-domain temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-experts to eliminate error propagation while maintaining competitive rate-distortion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learned video compression frameworks face a dilemma: separate-transform frameworks cause error propagation, while unified-transform frameworks have inferior motion estimation/compensation in shared latent domains. Need to eliminate error propagation while maintaining good temporal alignment.

Method: 1) Dual-domain progressive temporal alignment: coarse pixel-domain alignment using optical flow from single reference frame for simple motion, plus refined latent-domain alignment using Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over multiple reference frames for complex motion. 2) Quality-Conditioned Mixture-of-Experts (QCMoE): dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content, enabling continuous bit-rate adaptation.

Result: Achieves competitive rate-distortion performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while successfully eliminating error propagation. Enables quality-consistent and error-propagation-free video streaming.

Conclusion: The proposed unified-transform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and QCMoE effectively addresses the error propagation problem in learned video compression while maintaining strong compression performance through improved temporal context modeling and adaptive quantization.

Abstract: Existing frameworks for learned video compression suffer from a dilemma between inaccurate temporal alignment and error propagation for motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC). The separate-transform framework employs distinct transforms for intra-frame and inter-frame compression to yield impressive rate-distortion (R-D) performance but causes evident error propagation, while the unified-transform framework eliminates error propagation via shared transforms but is inferior in ME/MC in shared latent domains. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel unifiedtransform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to enable quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression. Specifically, we propose dualdomain progressive temporal alignment for ME/MC that leverages coarse pixel-domain alignment and refined latent-domain alignment to significantly enhance temporal context modeling in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The coarse pixel-domain alignment efficiently handles simple motion patterns with optical flow estimated from a single reference frame, while the refined latent-domain alignment develops a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over latents from multiple reference frames to achieve long-term motion refinement (LTMR) for complex motion patterns. Furthermore, we design a QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation that dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content rather than relies on a single quantization step. QCMoE allows continuous and consistent rate control with appealing R-D performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive R-D performance compared with the state-of-the-arts, while successfully eliminating error propagation.

*Khurram Ashfaq,Muhammad Tariq Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid Shape-from-Focus method combining traditional DDL kernels for focus volume extraction with lightweight GRU-based refinement and learned upsampling for high-quality depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning SFF methods use heavy feature encoders and simple one-step aggregation that introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in depth maps. Need for more robust and efficient approach.

Method: 1) Compute multi-scale focus volumes using traditional handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels to capture long-range directional focus variations. 2) Feed these into lightweight multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines initial depth estimate at lower resolution. 3) Use learned convex upsampling module within recurrent network to reconstruct high-resolution depth maps while preserving details and boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.

Conclusion: Proposed hybrid framework effectively combines traditional focus volume computation with lightweight deep learning refinement, resulting in more accurate, artifact-free depth estimation with better generalization than existing methods.

Abstract: Shape-from-Focus (SFF) is a passive depth estimation technique that infers scene depth by analyzing focus variations in a focal stack. Most recent deep learning-based SFF methods typically operate in two stages: first, they extract focus volumes (a per pixel representation of focus likelihood across the focal stack) using heavy feature encoders; then, they estimate depth via a simple one-step aggregation technique that often introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in the depth map. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid framework. Our method computes multi-scale focus volumes traditionally using handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels, which capture long-range and directional focus variations to form robust focus volumes. These focus volumes are then fed into a lightweight, multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines an initial depth estimate at a lower resolution for computational efficiency. Finally, a learned convex upsampling module within our recurrent network reconstructs high-resolution depth maps while preserving fine scene details and sharp boundaries. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.

Conclusion: TaP addresses the critical limitation of encoder generalization in FSS, paving the way for more robust, efficient, and generalizable segmentation systems. The method demonstrates practical effectiveness in realistic settings with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes in query images using only a small annotated support set. While prior research has mainly focused on improving decoders, the encoder's limited ability to extract meaningful features for unseen classes remains a key bottleneck. In this work, we introduce \textit{Take a Peek} (TaP), a simple yet effective method that enhances encoder adaptability for both FSS and cross-domain FSS (CD-FSS). TaP leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the encoder on the support set with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing FSS pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks--including COCO $20^i$, Pascal $5^i$, and cross-domain datasets such as DeepGlobe, ISIC, and Chest X-ray--demonstrate that TaP consistently improves segmentation performance across diverse models and shot settings. Notably, TaP delivers significant gains in complex multi-class scenarios, highlighting its practical effectiveness in realistic settings. A rank sensitivity analysis also shows that strong performance can be achieved even with low-rank adaptations, ensuring computational efficiency. By addressing a critical limitation in FSS--the encoder's generalization to novel classes--TaP paves the way toward more robust, efficient, and generalizable segmentation systems.

TL;DR: Blink: A dynamic visual token resolution framework for MLLMs that emulates human "blink-like" visual scanning by selectively allocating more computation to salient regions within a single forward pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limited visual perception compared to humans who efficiently perceive complex scenes by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions. The authors investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior and find they naturally attend to different visual regions across layers, suggesting selective computation allocation could enhance perception.

Method: Blink framework with two modules: 1) Saliency-guided scanning that estimates visual token importance based on attention maps, and 2) Dynamic token resolution that extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module, then drops extended tokens when they lose focus in subsequent layers.

Result: Extensive experiments validate Blink's effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding. The dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, improving MLLM performance adaptively and efficiently.

Conclusion: Blink successfully emulates human-inspired visual scanning in MLLMs, demonstrating that dynamic allocation of computation to salient visual regions within a single forward pass can significantly enhance multimodal perception capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various vision-language tasks, yet their visual perception remains limited. Humans, in comparison, perceive complex scenes efficiently by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential "blink-like" process. Motivated by this strategy, we first investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior. Our pilot analysis reveals that MLLMs naturally attend to different visual regions across layers and that selectively allocating more computation to salient tokens can enhance visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose Blink, a dynamic visual token resolution framework that emulates the human-inspired process within a single forward pass. Specifically, Blink includes two modules: saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution. It first estimates the saliency of visual tokens in each layer based on the attention map, and extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module. In the next layer, it drops the extended tokens when they lose focus. This dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, thereby enhancing visual perception adaptively and efficiently. Extensive experiments validate Blink, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: GETok introduces spatial tokens for MLLMs to improve 2D object grounding without changing autoregressive architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with accurate 2D object grounding because their tokenization approach limits spatial reasoning capabilities in image space.

Method: GETok uses learnable grid tokens to partition images into spatial anchors and offset tokens for iterative refinement of localization predictions, embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens.

Result: GETok achieves state-of-the-art performance across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings.

Conclusion: The method enables MLLMs to perform native 2D space reasoning while maintaining their autoregressive architecture, significantly advancing object grounding capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in vision understanding and reasoning. However, the autoregressive Transformer architecture used by MLLMs requries tokenization on input images, which limits their ability to accurately ground objects within the 2D image space. This raises an important question: how can sequential language tokens be improved to better ground objects in 2D spatial space for MLLMs? To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GETok achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISLR faces data scarcity and long-tail vocabulary distribution, making standard classification approaches overfit to frequent classes and fail on rare signs. Need scalable solution for recognizing extensive vocabularies with limited data.

Method: Few-shot prototypical network framework with skeleton-based encoder using ST-GCN and novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module. Episodic training learns semantic metric space where signs are classified based on proximity to dynamic class prototypes.

Result: Achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on WLASL dataset, outperforming standard classification baseline by over 13%. Shows strong zero-shot generalization with nearly 30% accuracy on unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Prototypical training strategy effectively addresses data scarcity where standard classification fails, offering scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data through metric learning paradigm.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is critical for bridging the communication gap between the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community and the hearing world. However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, achieving nearly 30% accuracy on the unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning, offering a scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data.

Motivation: Existing all-in-one image restoration methods rely on complex architectures (Mixture-of-Experts, diffusion models) and elaborate degradation prompt strategies, creating unnecessary complexity.

Method: Proposes SymUNet: symmetric U-Net architecture with aligned feature scales across encoder-decoder and streamlined cross-scale propagation. Also introduces SE-SymUNet variant with semantic enhancement via frozen CLIP features using simple cross-attention.

Result: Achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. Both SymUNet and SE-SymUNet establish simpler and stronger foundations for all-in-one image restoration.

Conclusion: Well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation information, and symmetric U-Net architecture is sufficient to unleash these cues effectively without complex architectures or elaborate degradation prompts.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to handle diverse degradations (e.g., noise, blur, adverse weather) within a unified framework, yet existing methods increasingly rely on complex architectures (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts, diffusion models) and elaborate degradation prompt strategies. In this work, we reveal a critical insight: well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation-carrying information, and a symmetric U-Net architecture is sufficient to unleash these cues effectively. By aligning feature scales across encoder-decoder and enabling streamlined cross-scale propagation, our symmetric design preserves intrinsic degradation signals robustly, rendering simple additive fusion in skip connections sufficient for state-of-the-art performance. Our primary baseline, SymUNet, is built on this symmetric U-Net and achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. We further propose a semantic enhanced variant, SE-SymUNet, which integrates direct semantic injection from frozen CLIP features via simple cross-attention to explicitly amplify degradation priors. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks validate the superiority of our methods. Both baselines SymUNet and SE-SymUNet establish simpler and stronger foundations for future advancements in all-in-one image restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most SOD methods assume ideal visual conditions and fail to handle weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy.

Method: Proposes a SOD framework with specific encoder and replaceable decoder, introducing a one-hot noise indicator vector and Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM) that embeds weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation.

Result: Extensive experiments on WXSOD dataset show the NIFM-enhanced specific encoder improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to vanilla encoders across various training data scales and configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses weather-induced noise in SOD tasks while maintaining compatibility with mainstream decoders, enhancing real-world applicability.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD), a foundational task in computer vision, has advanced from single-modal to multi-modal paradigms to enhance generalization. However, most existing SOD methods assume low-noise visual conditions, overlooking the degradation of segmentation accuracy caused by weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a SOD framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, encompassing a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation. Critically, the proposed specific encoder retains compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders. Extensive experiments are conducted on the WXSOD dataset under varying training data scales (100%, 50%, 30% of the full training set), three encoder and seven decoder configurations. Results show that the proposed SOD framework (particularly the NIFM-enhanced specific encoder) improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to a vanilla encoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the semantic gap in remote sensing image retrieval and overcome limitations of costly domain-specific training for VLMs, while lacking benchmarks for zero-shot VLM utility evaluation.

Method: Introduce RSRT dataset with structured captions, propose TRSLLaVA - a training-free text-only retrieval approach that reformulates cross-modal retrieval as text-to-text matching using VLM-generated captions in unified textual embedding space.

Result: Achieves 42.62% mean Recall on RSITMD (nearly double CLIP's 23.86%), competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models on RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks.

Conclusion: High-quality semantic representation through structured text provides powerful, cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval without training or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Semantic retrieval of remote sensing (RS) images is a critical task fundamentally challenged by the \textquote{semantic gap}, the discrepancy between a model's low-level visual features and high-level human concepts. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models. This validates that high-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval.

Unlike prior work focusing on human motion or video synthesis, we generate explicit trajectories for arbitrary objects using motion extracted from real-world videos via point tracking. Our transformer-based auto-encoder learns trajectory representations through dual supervision: textual motion descriptions and rendered trajectory visualizations, both mapped through CLIP's frozen encoders. Lang2Motion achieves 34.2% Recall@1 on text-to-trajectory retrieval, outperforming video-based methods by 12.5 points, and improves motion accuracy by 33-52% (12.4 ADE vs 18.3-25.3) compared to video generation baselines. We demonstrate 88.3% Top-1 accuracy on human action recognition despite training only on diverse object motions, showing effective transfer across motion domains. Lang2Motion supports style transfer, semantic interpolation, and latent-space editing through CLIP-aligned trajectory representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOCR-Inspector is a VLM-based system that assesses document parsing quality through fine-grained error detection and analysis, outperforming commercial models and providing guidance for parsing refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current document parsing evaluation relies on standard benchmarks with dataset-specific biases, providing only overall scores that obscure error patterns and have limited correlation with real-world performance.

Method: Formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection using VLM-as-a-Judge, identifies errors across 28 predefined types, uses DOCRcase-200K for training, and employs Chain-of-Checklist reasoning for hierarchical quality assessment.

Result: DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and leading open-source models on DOCRcaseBench (882 real-world cases), and its quality assessments effectively guide parsing refinement.

Conclusion: DOCR-Inspector provides reliable, comprehensive document parsing assessment that serves as both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing parsing systems, addressing the gap between benchmark performance and real-world quality.

Abstract: Document parsing aims to transform unstructured PDF images into semi-structured data, facilitating the digitization and utilization of information in diverse domains. While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations. On this benchmark, DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as leading open-source models. Further experiments demonstrate that its quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing results refinement, making DOCR-Inspector both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing document parsing systems at scale.

TL;DR: K-Track is a hybrid acceleration framework that combines sparse deep learning keyframe updates with lightweight Kalman filtering to enable 5-10X speedup for point tracking while maintaining over 85% accuracy, making real-time deployment on edge devices feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based point trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but rely on per-frame GPU inference, which is impractical for resource-constrained edge devices with limited compute, power, and connectivity.

Method: K-Track uses a tracker-agnostic hybrid approach: sparse deep learning updates on keyframes combined with lightweight Kalman filtering for intermediate frame prediction, with principled Bayesian uncertainty propagation to maintain temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves 5-10X speedup while retaining over 85% of original trackers' accuracy, enabling real-time performance on edge platforms like NVIDIA Jetson Nano and RTX Titan across multiple state-of-the-art point trackers.

Conclusion: K-Track provides a practical solution for deploying high-quality point tracking in resource-limited settings, bridging the gap between modern tracking algorithms and deployable vision systems on edge devices.

Abstract: Point tracking in video sequences is a foundational capability for real-world computer vision applications, including robotics, autonomous systems, augmented reality, and video analysis. While recent deep learning-based trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging benchmarks, their reliance on per-frame GPU inference poses a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, where compute, power, and connectivity are limited. We introduce K-Track (Kalman-enhanced Tracking), a general-purpose, tracker-agnostic acceleration framework designed to bridge this deployment gap. K-Track reduces inference cost by combining sparse deep learning keyframe updates with lightweight Kalman filtering for intermediate frame prediction, using principled Bayesian uncertainty propagation to maintain temporal coherence. This hybrid strategy enables 5-10X speedup while retaining over 85% of the original trackers' accuracy. We evaluate K-Track across multiple state-of-the-art point trackers and demonstrate real-time performance on edge platforms such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and RTX Titan. By preserving accuracy while dramatically lowering computational requirements, K-Track provides a practical path toward deploying high-quality point tracking in real-world, resource-limited settings, closing the gap between modern tracking algorithms and deployable vision systems.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have made it increasingly easy to fabricate realistic portrayals of individuals, creating serious risks for security, communication, and public trust. Detecting such person-driven manipulations requires systems that not only distinguish altered content from authentic media but also provide clear and reliable reasoning. In this paper, we introduce TriDF, a comprehensive benchmark for interpretable DeepFake detection. TriDF contains high-quality forgeries from advanced synthesis models, covering 16 DeepFake types across image, video, and audio modalities. The benchmark evaluates three key aspects: Perception, which measures the ability of a model to identify fine-grained manipulation artifacts using human-annotated evidence; Detection, which assesses classification performance across diverse forgery families and generators; and Hallucination, which quantifies the reliability of model-generated explanations. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal large language models show that accurate perception is essential for reliable detection, but hallucination can severely disrupt decision-making, revealing the interdependence of these three aspects. TriDF provides a unified framework for understanding the interaction between detection accuracy, evidence identification, and explanation reliability, offering a foundation for building trustworthy systems that address real-world synthetic media threats.

TL;DR: XDen-1K: First large-scale multi-modal dataset for real-world physical property estimation, focusing on volumetric density, with 1,000 objects across 148 categories, including 3D models and X-ray scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models capture object surface geometry but neglect internal physical properties like volumetric density, which are critical for predicting center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in robotics and simulation. The main bottleneck has been lack of large-scale real-world data.

Method: Introduce XDen-1K dataset with 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, providing high-resolution 3D geometric models with part-level annotations and corresponding biplanar X-ray scans. Develop novel optimization framework to recover volumetric density fields from sparse X-ray views.

Result: Dataset enables improved volumetric segmentation when X-ray images are used as conditioning signal. Downstream robotics experiments show improved accuracy of center-of-mass estimation and higher success rates in robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: XDen-1K serves as foundational resource and benchmark for physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI, bridging the gap in physical property estimation data and enabling better prediction of object behavior in real-world applications.

Abstract: A deep understanding of the physical world is a central goal for embodied AI and realistic simulation. While current models excel at capturing an object's surface geometry and appearance, they largely neglect its internal physical properties. This omission is critical, as properties like volumetric density are fundamental for predicting an object's center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to physical simulation. The primary bottleneck has been the absence of large-scale, real-world data. To bridge this gap, we introduce XDen-1K, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for real-world physical property estimation, with a particular focus on volumetric density. The core of this dataset consists of 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, for which we provide comprehensive multi-modal data, including a high-resolution 3D geometric model with part-level annotations and a corresponding set of real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Building upon this data, we introduce a novel optimization framework that recovers a high-fidelity volumetric density field of each object from its sparse X-ray views. To demonstrate its practical value, we add X-ray images as a conditioning signal to an existing segmentation network and perform volumetric segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on downstream robotics tasks. The results show that leveraging the dataset can effectively improve the accuracy of center-of-mass estimation and the success rate of robotic manipulation. We believe XDen-1K will serve as a foundational resource and a challenging new benchmark, catalyzing future research in physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo6DPose: A lightweight, training-free, fully local pipeline for zero-shot 6D object pose estimation that uses geometric filtering with foundation model features instead of large-scale models, achieving sub-second inference on commodity GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods rely on large-scale models and cloud inference, causing high latency, energy consumption, and deployment risks (connectivity, cost, data governance). These conflict with practical robotics constraints where compute is limited and on-device inference is needed.

Method: Combines foundation model visual features with geometric filtering: computes similarity maps between template DINO descriptors and scene patches, establishes mutual correspondences by projecting scene patches to 3D and template descriptors to object coordinates, recovers poses via correspondence-driven RANSAC, and ranks poses using a weighted geometric alignment metric considering reprojection consistency and spatial support.

Result: Achieves sub-second inference on single commodity GPU while matching average recall of larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS). Requires no training, fine-tuning, or network access, and remains compatible with evolving foundation backbones.

Conclusion: Geo6DPose advances practical, fully local 6D perception for robotic deployment by trading model scale for geometric reliability, addressing latency, energy, and deployment constraints of real-world robotics applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in zero-shot 6D object pose estimation has been driven largely by large-scale models and cloud-based inference. However, these approaches often introduce high latency, elevated energy consumption, and deployment risks related to connectivity, cost, and data governance; factors that conflict with the practical constraints of real-world robotics, where compute is limited and on-device inference is frequently required. We introduce Geo6DPose, a lightweight, fully local, and training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D pose estimation that trades model scale for geometric reliability. Our method combines foundation model visual features with a geometric filtering strategy: Similarity maps are computed between onboarded template DINO descriptors and scene patches, and mutual correspondences are established by projecting scene patch centers to 3D and template descriptors to the object model coordinate system. Final poses are recovered via correspondence-driven RANSAC and ranked using a weighted geometric alignment metric that jointly accounts for reprojection consistency and spatial support, improving robustness to noise, clutter, and partial visibility. Geo6DPose achieves sub-second inference on a single commodity GPU while matching the average recall of significantly larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS). It requires no training, fine-tuning, or network access, and remains compatible with evolving foundation backbones, advancing practical, fully local 6D perception for robotic deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SMLM methods require non-overlapping fluorophores, leading to long acquisition times that hinder live-cell imaging. Deep learning approaches use non-differentiable NMS layers that discard true positives.

Method: Reformulates SMLM training as set-matching problem with optimal transport loss, eliminating NMS during inference. Proposes iterative neural network integrating microscope optical system knowledge.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on synthetic benchmarks and real biological data at moderate and high emitter densities. Code available at GitHub.

Conclusion: SHOT enables end-to-end training without NMS, improving SMLM performance for faster super-resolution imaging with denser fluorophore emissions.

Abstract: Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) allows reconstructing biology-relevant structures beyond the diffraction limit by detecting and localizing individual fluorophores -- fluorescent molecules stained onto the observed specimen -- over time to reconstruct super-resolved images. Currently, efficient SMLM requires non-overlapping emitting fluorophores, leading to long acquisition times that hinders live-cell imaging. Recent deep-learning approaches can handle denser emissions, but they rely on variants of non-maximum suppression (NMS) layers, which are unfortunately non-differentiable and may discard true positives with their local fusion strategy. In this presentation, we reformulate the SMLM training objective as a set-matching problem, deriving an optimal-transport loss that eliminates the need for NMS during inference and enables end-to-end training. Additionally, we propose an iterative neural network that integrates knowledge of the microscope's optical system inside our model. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real biological data show that both our new loss function and architecture surpass the state of the art at moderate and high emitter densities.

TL;DR: SHARP enables photorealistic view synthesis from a single image using 3D Gaussian representation, achieving state-of-the-art results with real-time rendering and metric camera movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of generating photorealistic novel views from just a single input image, which has applications in VR/AR, content creation, and 3D reconstruction. Prior methods often require multiple images or have limitations in quality and speed.

Method: SHARP uses a neural network to regress parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation from a single input image in a single feedforward pass (<1 second on GPU). The 3D Gaussians can then be rendered in real-time to produce high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views.

Result: SHARP achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% compared to prior best models. It also reduces synthesis time by three orders of magnitude while maintaining robust zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: SHARP demonstrates that single-image photorealistic view synthesis with metric 3D representation and real-time rendering is achievable, setting new benchmarks for quality, speed, and generalization in the field.

Abstract: We present SHARP, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: This paper introduces uncertainty estimation methods for anatomical landmark-based segmentation in chest X-rays, proposing two complementary uncertainty measures and releasing a large-scale dataset with per-node uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty estimation is crucial for safe clinical deployment of medical image segmentation systems, but prior work has focused on pixel-level uncertainty while landmark-based segmentation with topological guarantees remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective.

Method: The authors leverage hybrid neural network architectures combining standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders. Using their variational latent space, they derive two complementary uncertainty measures: (1) latent uncertainty from learned distribution parameters, and (2) predictive uncertainty from multiple stochastic output predictions generated from latent samples.

Result: Both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity in controlled corruption experiments, reflecting global and local degradation. The uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions compared to manual ground-truth and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. The authors release CheXmask-U, a large-scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: Uncertainty estimation is a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray, with released resources including a dataset, interactive demo, and source code to support further research.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for the safe clinical deployment of medical image segmentation systems, enabling the identification of unreliable predictions and supporting human oversight. While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks. Our findings establish uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray.

TL;DR: SpaceDrive is a spatial-aware VLM-based autonomous driving framework that treats 3D spatial information as explicit positional encodings rather than textual tokens, enabling better spatial reasoning and more accurate trajectory planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision language models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained 3D spatial understanding, which is essential for autonomous driving systems that interact with the physical world. There's a need to enhance VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities for driving applications.

Method: Proposes SpaceDrive framework that uses a universal positional encoder for all 3D coordinates from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D positional encodings are superimposed on 2D visual tokens and serve as task-agnostic coordinate representations, replacing digit-wise numerical tokens for both inputs and outputs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on nuScenes dataset and second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark among existing VLM-based methods.

Conclusion: SpaceDrive effectively enhances VLM-based autonomous driving by explicitly encoding spatial information, enabling better spatial reasoning and more accurate trajectory planning compared to existing VLM approaches.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods built on vision language models (VLMs) have undergone rapid development driven by their universal visual understanding and strong reasoning capabilities obtained from the large-scale pretraining. However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark over existing VLM-based methods.

Conclusion: VeloDepth provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks, with code and models publicly available.

Abstract: Depth estimation in videos is essential for visual perception in real-world applications. However, existing methods either rely on simple frame-by-frame monocular models, leading to temporal inconsistencies and inaccuracies, or use computationally demanding temporal modeling, unsuitable for real-time applications. These limitations significantly restrict general applicability and performance in practical settings. To address this, we propose VeloDepth, an efficient and robust online video depth estimation pipeline that effectively leverages spatiotemporal priors from previous depth predictions and performs deep feature propagation. Our method introduces a novel Propagation Module that refines and propagates depth features and predictions using flow-based warping coupled with learned residual corrections. In addition, our design structurally enforces temporal consistency, resulting in stable depth predictions across consecutive frames with improved efficiency. Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates the state-of-the-art temporal consistency and competitive accuracy of VeloDepth, alongside its significantly faster inference compared to existing video-based depth estimators. VeloDepth thus provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks.

Method: Propose IRMoGen paradigm with IRG-MotionLLM model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement. Use three-stage training scheme and automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing datasets.

Result: Assessment and refinement significantly improve text-motion alignment; interleaving steps yields consistent performance gains; IRG-MotionLLM outperforms baselines and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion benchmarks.

Conclusion: The interleaved reasoning paradigm effectively bridges motion understanding and generation, demonstrating that assessment and refinement tasks enable bidirectional knowledge flow that improves overall motion generation performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion-aware large language models have shown remarkable promise for unifying motion understanding and generation tasks. However, these models typically treat understanding and generation separately, limiting the mutual benefits that could arise from interactive feedback between tasks. In this work, we reveal that motion assessment and refinement tasks act as crucial bridges to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between understanding and generation. Leveraging this insight, we propose Interleaved Reasoning for Motion Generation (IRMoGen), a novel paradigm that tightly couples motion generation with assessment and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. To realize this, we introduce IRG-MotionLLM, the first model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement to improve generation performance. IRG-MotionLLM is developed progressively with a novel three-stage training scheme, initializing and subsequently enhancing native IRMoGen capabilities. To facilitate this development, we construct an automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing text-motion datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (i) Assessment and refinement tasks significantly improve text-motion alignment; (ii) Interleaving motion generation, assessment, and refinement steps yields consistent performance gains across training stages; and (iii) IRG-MotionLLM clearly outperforms the baseline model and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion generation benchmarks. Cross-evaluator testing further validates its effectiveness. Code & Data: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/IRG-MotionLLM/tree/main.

Conclusion: LDP offers a scalable, clinically viable solution for primary healthcare polyp diagnosis, addressing data scarcity and hallucination issues while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Colonoscopic polyp diagnosis is pivotal for early colorectal cancer detection, yet traditional automated reporting suffers from inconsistencies and hallucinations due to the scarcity of high-quality multimodal medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose LDP, a novel framework leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for professional polyp diagnosis report generation. Specifically, we curate MMEndo, a multimodal endoscopic dataset comprising expert-annotated colonoscopy image-text pairs. We fine-tune the Qwen2-VL-7B backbone using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA) and align it with clinical standards via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments show that our LDP outperforms existing baselines on both automated metrics and rigorous clinical expert evaluations (achieving a Physician Score of 7.2/10), significantly reducing training computational costs by 833x compared to full fine-tuning. The proposed solution offers a scalable, clinically viable path for primary healthcare, with additional validation on the IU-XRay dataset confirming its robustness.

*Rene Lisasi,Michele Esposito,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline automates coronary geometry extraction from CCTA, streamlines CFD simulation data generation, and uses a diffusion-based regression model to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA features, bypassing slow CFD computation during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFD-based simulation of coronary blood flow provides valuable hemodynamic markers for CAD diagnosis but is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into clinical workflows, limiting labeled data availability for AI models and hindering broad adoption of non-invasive CAD assessment.

Method: Develop an end-to-end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from CCTA, streamlines simulation data generation, and introduces a diffusion-based regression model to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA-derived features, bypassing CFD computation during inference.

Result: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance with R² of 64.42%, RMSE of 0.0974, and normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches on simulated coronary hemodynamics data.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis, reducing manual burden while producing consistent training data and enabling efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based simulation of coronary blood flow provides valuable hemodynamic markers, such as pressure gradients, for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches. This work provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis.

### [108] [What matters for Representation Alignment: Global Information or Spatial Structure?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10794)
*Jaskirat Singh,Xingjian Leng,Zongze Wu,Liang Zheng,Richard Zhang,Eli Shechtman,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges conventional wisdom that global semantic performance of vision encoders drives generation quality in representation alignment methods, finding instead that spatial structure (patch token similarity) is more important. The authors propose iREPA, a simple modification emphasizing spatial information transfer that improves convergence speed across various encoders and training variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates a fundamental question about representation alignment (REPA) methods: what aspect of target representations from pretrained vision encoders matters most for generative training - global semantic information (e.g., ImageNet accuracy) or spatial structure (patch token similarity)? This challenges the prevalent assumption that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation.

Method: 1) Large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and model scales to study the relationship between representation characteristics and generation performance. 2) Introduction of iREPA with two simple modifications: replacing MLP projection layer with a convolution layer, and adding a spatial normalization layer for external representations to accentuate spatial information transfer.

Result: Surprising finding: spatial structure, not global semantic performance, drives generation quality. iREPA (implemented in <4 lines of code) consistently improves convergence speed across diverse vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT, etc.).

Conclusion: The work challenges fundamental assumptions about representation alignment mechanisms and demonstrates that emphasizing spatial information transfer through simple architectural modifications can significantly improve generative model training. This motivates rethinking how representational alignment works and how to better leverage it for generative models.

Abstract: Representation alignment (REPA) guides generative training by distilling representations from a strong, pretrained vision encoder to intermediate diffusion features. We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \textit{global} \revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

*Masum Shah Junayed,John Derek Van Vessem,Qian Wan,Gahie Nam,Sheida Nabavi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLAT with IRM improves prostate cancer grading by iteratively selecting relevant tissue patches and modeling spatial consistency via graph Laplacian constraints, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prostate cancer grading from WSIs is challenging due to large-scale images, heterogeneous tissue structures, and difficulty selecting diagnostically relevant regions. Existing approaches using random/static patch selection include redundant/non-informative regions that degrade performance.

Method: Propose Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) with Iterative Refinement Module (IRM). IRM iteratively refines patch selection using pretrained ResNet50 for local features and foundation model for importance scoring. GLAT models tissue connectivity via graph construction (patches as nodes), ensures spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints, and refines features via learnable filtering. Convex aggregation dynamically adjusts patch importance for WSI-level representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset demonstrate the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed GLAT with IRM effectively addresses challenges in prostate cancer grading by enhancing feature learning and spatial consistency through iterative patch refinement and graph-based modeling, resulting in superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Prostate cancer grading from whole-slide images (WSIs) remains a challenging task due to the large-scale nature of WSIs, the presence of heterogeneous tissue structures, and difficulty of selecting diagnostically relevant regions. Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures. Additionally, a convex aggregation mechanism dynamically adjusts patch importance to generate a robust WSI-level representation. Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.

### [110] [Self-Ensemble Post Learning for Noisy Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10818)
*Wang Lu,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEPL method enhances domain generalization robustness against label noise by leveraging intermediate features and ensemble learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain generalization faces performance degradation when encountering noisy labels, which exacerbate spurious feature enlargement in deep layers. Existing methods struggle with this combined challenge of distribution shift and label noise.

Method: Self-Ensemble Post Learning (SEPL) approach with two components: 1) Feature probing training using semi-supervised algorithms to train multiple probing classifiers on intermediate features, and 2) Prediction ensemble inference using crowdsourcing approach to integrate outputs from diverse classification heads.

Result: Extensive experiments show SEPL enhances robustness of existing methods and exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.

Conclusion: SEPL effectively addresses the combined challenge of domain generalization and label noise by leveraging latent feature diversity and ensemble learning, offering a practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: While computer vision and machine learning have made great progress, their robustness is still challenged by two key issues: data distribution shift and label noise. When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers. Given that different probing classifiers focus on different areas, we integrate their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the robustness of existing methods but also exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.

*Jianqi Chen,Biao Zhang,Xiangjun Tang,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseGAM is a geometry-aware multi-view framework for 6D object pose estimation that directly predicts poses from query and template images without explicit feature matching, achieving state-of-the-art performance on unseen objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 6D object pose estimation methods struggle with unseen objects and typically rely on explicit feature correspondences between query images and object models/templates, which limits generalization capabilities.

Method: A multi-view framework built on foundation model architectures that integrates object geometry through explicit point-based geometry and learned features from geometry representation networks, trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset with 190k+ objects.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with average AR improvement of 5.1% over prior methods and up to 17.6% gains on individual datasets, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen objects.

Conclusion: PoseGAM effectively addresses the challenge of unseen object pose estimation by eliminating explicit matching and incorporating geometry awareness through complementary mechanisms, achieving superior generalization performance.

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation, which predicts the transformation of an object relative to the camera, remains challenging for unseen objects. Existing approaches typically rely on explicitly constructing feature correspondences between the query image and either the object model or template images. In this work, we propose PoseGAM, a geometry-aware multi-view framework that directly predicts object pose from a query image and multiple template images, eliminating the need for explicit matching. Built upon recent multi-view-based foundation model architectures, the method integrates object geometry information through two complementary mechanisms: explicit point-based geometry and learned features from geometry representation networks. In addition, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset containing more than 190k objects under diverse environmental conditions to enhance robustness and generalization. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, yielding an average AR improvement of 5.1% over prior methods and achieving up to 17.6% gains on individual datasets, indicating strong generalization to unseen objects.

### [112] [SWiT-4D: Sliding-Window Transformer for Lossless and Parameter-Free Temporal 4D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10860)
*Kehong Gong,Zhengyu Wen,Mingxi Xu,Weixia He,Qi Wang,Ning Zhang,Zhengyu Li,Chenbin Li,Dongze Lian,Wei Zhao,Xiaoyu He,Mingyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWiT-4D converts monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets with explicit 4D meshes using a sliding-window transformer approach that leverages image-to-3D priors with minimal 4D supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of converting monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets with explicit 4D meshes. Current limitations include the scarcity of large-scale 4D mesh datasets for training generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch, while image-to-3D generation has advanced significantly with extensive datasets and powerful prior models.

Method: SWiT-4D is a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. It integrates with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process. This enables 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. The method also includes an optimization-based trajectory module for recovering global translation in static-camera monocular videos.

Result: SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency, achieving high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

Conclusion: SWiT-4D provides a practical solution for video-to-4D mesh generation by effectively leveraging image-to-3D priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, demonstrating strong performance and deployability under limited 4D data constraints.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 4D content generation, the conversion of monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets with explicit 4D meshes remains considerably challenging. The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

*Jingli Lin,Runsen Xu,Shaohao Zhu,Sihan Yang,Peizhou Cao,Yunlong Ran,Miao Hu,Chenming Zhu,Yiman Xie,Yilin Long,Wenbo Hu,Dahua Lin,Tai Wang,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMSI-Video-Bench is a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark for evaluating video-based spatial intelligence in multimodal large language models, covering perception, planning, prediction, and cross-video reasoning across 1,106 questions from diverse video sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack comprehensive evaluation for spatial understanding in continuous visual input, which is crucial for developing general-purpose assistants in physical environments. There's no holistic benchmark to assess progress toward this goal.

Method: Created a fully human-annotated benchmark with 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 video clips from 25 existing datasets and in-house videos. Uses a four-level framework: Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning. Each item designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales.

Result: Evaluation of 25 strong MLLMs reveals a significant human-AI gap - many models perform near chance, best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. Spatially fine-tuned models fail to generalize effectively. Systematic failures identified in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence.

Conclusion: The benchmark establishes a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs, revealing critical gaps in current models' spatial reasoning capabilities and providing targeted assessment tools through domain-oriented sub-benchmarks.

Abstract: Spatial understanding over continuous visual input is crucial for MLLMs to evolve into general-purpose assistants in physical environments. Yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark that holistically assesses the progress toward this goal. In this work, we introduce MMSI-Video-Bench, a fully human-annotated benchmark for video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs. It operationalizes a four-level framework, Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning, through 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 clips from 25 datasets and in-house videos. Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains. We expect our benchmark to establish a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Microscopic Spatial Intelligence (MiSI) and MiSI-Bench, a benchmark with 163K QA pairs and 587K images from 4K molecular structures to evaluate VLMs' ability to reason about microscopic spatial relationships. Current VLMs perform below humans, but fine-tuned 7B models show potential, surpassing humans in spatial transformations but failing in scientific tasks like hydrogen bond recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess Vision-Language Models' capability in Microscopic Spatial Intelligence - perceiving and reasoning about spatial relationships of invisible microscopic entities, which is fundamental to scientific discovery but currently underexplored in AI research.

Method: The authors propose MiSI-Bench, a systematic benchmark framework with over 163,000 question-answer pairs and 587,000 images derived from approximately 4,000 molecular structures. It covers nine complementary tasks evaluating abilities from elementary spatial transformations to complex relational identifications.

Result: Current state-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly below human level on MiSI-Bench. However, a fine-tuned 7B model demonstrates substantial potential, even surpassing humans in spatial transformation tasks. The model shows poor performance in scientifically-grounded tasks like hydrogen bond recognition.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals current VLMs' limitations in microscopic spatial reasoning. While fine-tuned models show promise in basic spatial tasks, their failure in scientific reasoning tasks underscores the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge for progress toward scientific AGI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCapAnything is a category-agnostic motion capture system that generates BVH animations for arbitrary 3D assets from monocular video, using reference-guided joint trajectory prediction and constraint-aware inverse kinematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion capture pipelines are limited to specific species or templates, creating a gap for handling arbitrary 3D assets. The paper aims to enable scalable, prompt-driven motion capture for any rigged 3D model.

Method: A factorized framework with three learnable modules: 1) Reference Prompt Encoder extracts joint queries from asset skeleton/mesh/images, 2) Video Feature Extractor computes visual descriptors and coarse 4D mesh, 3) Unified Motion Decoder fuses cues for temporal trajectories, plus constraint-aware IK for rotation recovery.

Result: The system produces high-quality skeletal animations and enables meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs. Evaluated on Truebones Zoo (1038 motion clips) and in-the-wild videos, showing effective performance.

Conclusion: MoCapAnything successfully addresses Category-Agnostic Motion Capture, enabling scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets with robust cross-species retargeting capabilities.

Abstract: Motion capture now underpins content creation far beyond digital humans, yet most existing pipelines remain species- or template-specific. We formalize this gap as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap): given a monocular video and an arbitrary rigged 3D asset as a prompt, the goal is to reconstruct a rotation-based animation such as BVH that directly drives the specific asset. We present MoCapAnything, a reference-guided, factorized framework that first predicts 3D joint trajectories and then recovers asset-specific rotations via constraint-aware inverse kinematics. The system contains three learnable modules and a lightweight IK stage: (1) a Reference Prompt Encoder that extracts per-joint queries from the asset's skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) a Video Feature Extractor that computes dense visual descriptors and reconstructs a coarse 4D deforming mesh to bridge the gap between video and joint space; and (3) a Unified Motion Decoder that fuses these cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories. We also curate Truebones Zoo with 1038 motion clips, each providing a standardized skeleton-mesh-render triad. Experiments on both in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos show that MoCapAnything delivers high-quality skeletal animations and exhibits meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs, enabling scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in table extraction has been hindered by lack of annotated data, especially for multi-page table structure recognition and comprehensive page-level extraction.

Method: Created PubTables-v2 dataset supporting multiple table extraction tasks, used it to evaluate domain-specialized vision-language models, and developed POTATR (Page-Object Table Transformer) as an image-to-graph extension of Table Transformer for page-level table extraction.

Result: PubTables-v2 enables evaluation of current methods on challenging table extraction tasks, demonstrates progress in the field, and supports the development of POTATR for comprehensive page-level table extraction.

Conclusion: PubTables-v2 addresses the data scarcity problem in table extraction research, provides the first multi-page table structure recognition benchmark, and enables development of more advanced models like POTATR for comprehensive document understanding.

Abstract: Table extraction (TE) is a key challenge in visual document understanding. Traditional approaches detect tables first, then recognize their structure. Recently, interest has surged in developing methods, such as vision-language models (VLMs), that can extract tables directly in their full page or document context. However, progress has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of annotated data. To address this, we create a new large-scale dataset, PubTables-v2. PubTables-v2 supports a number of current challenging table extraction tasks. Notably, it is the first large-scale benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition. We demonstrate its usefulness by evaluating domain-specialized VLMs on these tasks and highlighting current progress. Finally, we use PubTables-v2 to create the Page-Object Table Transformer (POTATR), an image-to-graph extension of the Table Transformer to comprehensive page-level TE. Data, code, and trained models will be released.

Motivation: Existing VLM-based SVG generation methods produce only text during decoding and lack visual signals, leading to struggles with complex semantics and poor visual/geometric quality in generated SVGs.

Method: A unified multimodal model trained on both image and SVG datasets that jointly generates image tokens and SVG tokens end-to-end, with a novel test-time scaling strategy using the model's visual predictions as guidance for SVG decoding.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms existing approaches, producing visually faithful, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs across a wide range of applications.

Conclusion: Joint multimodal generation with visual guidance significantly improves SVG quality compared to text-only approaches, enabling better handling of complex semantics and geometric coherence.

Abstract: Recent vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches have achieved impressive results on SVG generation. However, because they generate only text and lack visual signals during decoding, they often struggle with complex semantics and fail to produce visually appealing or geometrically coherent SVGs. We introduce DuetSVG, a unified multimodal model that jointly generates image tokens and corresponding SVG tokens in an end-to-end manner. DuetSVG is trained on both image and SVG datasets. At inference, we apply a novel test-time scaling strategy that leverages the model's native visual predictions as guidance to improve SVG decoding quality. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods, producing visually faithful, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs across a wide range of applications.

Conclusion: FoundationMotion provides a scalable solution for curating fine-grained motion datasets that enable effective fine-tuning of diverse models to enhance motion understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Motion understanding is fundamental to physical reasoning, enabling models to infer dynamics and predict future states. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle on recent motion benchmarks, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets. Existing motion datasets are often constructed from costly manual annotation, severely limiting scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce FoundationMotion, a fully automated data curation pipeline that constructs large-scale motion datasets. Our approach first detects and tracks objects in videos to extract their trajectories, then leverages these trajectories and video frames with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate fine-grained captions and diverse question-answer pairs about motion and spatial reasoning. Using datasets produced by this pipeline, we fine-tune open-source models including NVILA-Video-15B and Qwen2.5-7B, achieving substantial improvements in motion understanding without compromising performance on other tasks. Notably, our models outperform strong closed-source baselines like Gemini-2.5 Flash and large open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B across diverse motion understanding datasets and benchmarks. FoundationMotion thus provides a scalable solution for curating fine-grained motion datasets that enable effective fine-tuning of diverse models to enhance motion understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early children's developmental trajectories provide a natural goal for sample-efficient pretraining of vision foundation models, aiming to create more developmentally plausible AI systems.

Method: Uses a longitudinal, infant-centric audiovisual corpus for pretraining (video-utterance, image-utterance, multi-turn conversational data) and introduces DevCV Toolbox that adapts NIH Baby Toolbox measures into 10 multimodal tasks covering spatial reasoning, memory, and vocabulary.

Result: A compact model pretrained from scratch achieves competitive performance on DevCV Toolbox, even outperforming GPT-4o on some tasks.

Conclusion: The principled, unified BabyVLM-V2 framework aims to accelerate research in developmentally plausible pretraining of vision foundation models.

Abstract: Early children's developmental trajectories set up a natural goal for sample-efficient pretraining of vision foundation models. We introduce BabyVLM-V2, a developmentally grounded framework for infant-inspired vision-language modeling that extensively improves upon BabyVLM-V1 through a longitudinal, multifaceted pretraining set, a versatile model, and, most importantly, DevCV Toolbox for cognitive evaluation. The pretraining set maximizes coverage while minimizing curation of a longitudinal, infant-centric audiovisual corpus, yielding video-utterance, image-utterance, and multi-turn conversational data that mirror infant experiences. DevCV Toolbox adapts all vision-related measures of the recently released NIH Baby Toolbox into a benchmark suite of ten multimodal tasks, covering spatial reasoning, memory, and vocabulary understanding aligned with early children's capabilities. Experimental results show that a compact model pretrained from scratch can achieve competitive performance on DevCV Toolbox, outperforming GPT-4o on some tasks. We hope the principled, unified BabyVLM-V2 framework will accelerate research in developmentally plausible pretraining of vision foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Any4D is a scalable multi-view transformer for dense 4D reconstruction that directly predicts per-pixel motion and geometry for multiple frames, supporting various input modalities and achieving significantly better accuracy and efficiency than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work typically focuses on either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking, lacking comprehensive 4D reconstruction capabilities. There's a need for methods that can handle diverse input modalities and provide dense, metric-scale 4D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos.

Method: Uses a scalable multi-view transformer architecture with modular 4D scene representation. Separates egocentric factors (depthmaps, camera intrinsics) in local camera coordinates from allocentric factors (camera extrinsics, scene flow) in global world coordinates. Supports multiple input modalities including RGB, RGB-D, IMU egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements.

Result: Achieves superior performance with 2-3X lower error and 15X faster computation compared to prior methods across diverse setups. Enables dense feed-forward 4D reconstruction for N frames directly.

Conclusion: Any4D provides a flexible, efficient framework for comprehensive 4D reconstruction that can leverage multiple sensor modalities, opening avenues for various downstream applications in computer vision and robotics.

Abstract: We present Any4D, a scalable multi-view transformer for metric-scale, dense feed-forward 4D reconstruction. Any4D directly generates per-pixel motion and geometry predictions for N frames, in contrast to prior work that typically focuses on either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking. Moreover, unlike other recent methods for 4D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, Any4D can process additional modalities and sensors such as RGB-D frames, IMU-based egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements, when available. One of the key innovations that allows for such a flexible framework is a modular representation of a 4D scene; specifically, per-view 4D predictions are encoded using a variety of egocentric factors (depthmaps and camera intrinsics) represented in local camera coordinates, and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics and scene flow) represented in global world coordinates. We achieve superior performance across diverse setups - both in terms of accuracy (2-3X lower error) and compute efficiency (15X faster), opening avenues for multiple downstream applications.

TL;DR: Real-time talking head generation using Gaussian Splatting mapped to 3D Morphable Models with transformer-based audio-driven parameter prediction for temporal stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech-driven talking head methods have limitations: diffusion methods struggle with oneshot settings, while Gaussian Splatting approaches suffer from facial tracking inaccuracies and inconsistent mappings leading to unstable outputs and video artifacts, limiting real-world applications.

Method: Map Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars. Use transformer-based prediction of model parameters directly from audio to drive temporal consistency. Works from monocular video and independent audio speech inputs.

Result: Enables generation of real-time talking head videos with competitive quantitative and qualitative performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses temporal stability issues in real-time talking head generation by combining Gaussian Splatting with 3D Morphable Models and transformer-based audio-driven parameter prediction, enabling practical real-world applications.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking heads have recently emerged and enable interactive avatars. However, real-world applications are limited, as current methods achieve high visual fidelity but slow or fast yet temporally unstable. Diffusion methods provide realistic image generation, yet struggle with oneshot settings. Gaussian Splatting approaches are real-time, yet inaccuracies in facial tracking, or inconsistent Gaussian mappings, lead to unstable outputs and video artifacts that are detrimental to realistic use cases. We address this problem by mapping Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars. We introduce transformer-based prediction of model parameters, directly from audio, to drive temporal consistency. From monocular video and independent audio speech inputs, our method enables generation of real-time talking head videos where we report competitive quantitative and qualitative performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniView is a unified diffusion model framework that handles multiple 4D consistency tasks (novel view synthesis, text-to-video with camera control, image-to-video) in one model, outperforming task-specific approaches across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous camera control diffusion models were fragmented, focusing on specific subsets of 4D tasks and trained on disjoint data slices. There was a need for a unified approach that could generalize across diverse 4D consistency tasks.

Method: Separately represents space, time, and view conditions to enable flexible combinations of these inputs. This allows the model to handle static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories in time, and create videos with full camera control from text or image prompts.

Result: Competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks, improving image quality scores by up to 33% in multiview NVS, 60% in dynamic NVS, 20% in static camera control, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation.

Conclusion: OmniView demonstrates the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model with strong generalizability, unifying previously fragmented approaches to camera control in diffusion models.

Abstract: Prior approaches injecting camera control into diffusion models have focused on specific subsets of 4D consistency tasks: novel view synthesis, text-to-video with camera control, image-to-video, amongst others. Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consistency tasks. Our method separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. For example, OmniView can synthesize novel views from static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories forward and backward in time, and create videos from text or image prompts with full camera control. OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation. With strong generalizability in one model, OmniView demonstrates the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model. Project page is available at https://snap-research.github.io/OmniView/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mull-Tokens introduces modality-agnostic latent tokens that allow models to think in either image or text modalities for better multimodal reasoning, achieving significant improvements on spatial reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world reasoning requires going beyond language to handle spatial, temporal, and affordance reasoning that words alone cannot convey. Existing multimodal models are brittle, rely on specialist tools, costly image generation, or handcrafted data, and don't scale well for switching between text and image thoughts.

Method: Mull-Tokens are modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities. They're trained using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, then fine-tuned without supervision using only final answers, inspired by latent reasoning frameworks.

Result: Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks (puzzle solving, perspective-taking), Mull-Tokens outperform baselines using text-only or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving +3% average improvement and up to +16% on puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split.

Conclusion: Mull-Tokens offer a simple solution for abstract thinking across multiple modalities, addressing challenges in grounding textual and visual reasoning by enabling free-form thinking toward correct answers.

Abstract: Reasoning goes beyond language; the real world requires reasoning about space, time, affordances, and much more that words alone cannot convey. Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, we offer a simpler alternative -- Mull-Tokens -- modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities to let the model think free-form towards the correct answer. We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline. Adding to conversations around challenges in grounding textual and visual reasoning, Mull-Tokens offers a simple solution to abstractly think in multiple modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-JEPA is a vision-language model using Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that predicts continuous text embeddings instead of tokens, achieving better performance with fewer parameters and supporting selective decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision-language models autoregressively generate tokens, which can be inefficient and focus on surface-level linguistic patterns rather than task-relevant semantics. The authors aim to create a more efficient model that learns in an abstract representation space.

Method: VL-JEPA uses a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that predicts continuous embeddings of target texts rather than generating tokens. It learns in an abstract representation space, and at inference time uses a lightweight text decoder only when needed to translate embeddings into text.

Result: VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance than standard token-space VLM training with 50% fewer trainable parameters. It supports selective decoding that reduces decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance. It outperforms CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder on video classification/retrieval datasets and achieves comparable performance to classical VLMs on VQA datasets despite having only 1.6B parameters.

Conclusion: VL-JEPA demonstrates that predicting continuous embeddings in a joint embedding space is more efficient and effective than traditional token generation for vision-language tasks, offering better performance with fewer parameters and supporting various applications without architectural changes.

Abstract: We introduce VL-JEPA, a vision-language model built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable performance as classical VLMs (InstructBLIP, QwenVL) on four VQA datasets: GQA, TallyQA, POPE and POPEv2, despite only having 1.6B parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subject-driven video generation methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which is essential for applications like compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation.

Method: Introduces explicit timestamps conditioning with novel positional encoding for temporal intervals, incorporates subject-descriptive text tokens for better identity binding, and uses token-wise concatenation without additional cross-attention modules.

Result: AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods while enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos for the first time.

Conclusion: AlcheMinT provides a unified framework for subject-driven video generation with fine-grained temporal control, addressing limitations of existing methods and enabling new applications in compositional video synthesis and animation.

Abstract: Recent advances in subject-driven video generation with large diffusion models have enabled personalized content synthesis conditioned on user-provided subjects. However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applications such as compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation. We propose AlcheMinT, a unified framework that introduces explicit timestamps conditioning for subject-driven video generation. Our approach introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism that unlocks the encoding of temporal intervals, associated in our case with subject identities, while seamlessly integrating with the pretrained video generation model positional embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate subject-descriptive text tokens to strengthen binding between visual identity and video captions, mitigating ambiguity during generation. Through token-wise concatenation, AlcheMinT avoids any additional cross-attention modules and incurs negligible parameter overhead. We establish a benchmark evaluating multiple subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence. Experimental results demonstrate that AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods, while, for the first time, enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing referring video segmentation datasets focus on static attributes and salient objects, allowing target identification from single frames, thus underemphasizing motion in both videos and language expressions. There's a need to explore motion expression and reasoning for pixel-level video understanding.

Method: Introduces MeViS dataset with 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions (text and audio), covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 complex videos. Benchmarks 15 existing methods across 4 tasks: RVOS, AVOS, RMOT, and new RMEG task. Proposes LMPM++ approach for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT.

Result: Benchmark results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in motion expression-guided video understanding. The proposed LMPM++ achieves new state-of-the-art results on RVOS/AVOS/RMOT tasks.

Conclusion: MeViS provides a platform for developing motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex scenes. The dataset and method source code are publicly available, addressing the gap in motion-focused video understanding research.

Abstract: This paper proposes a large-scale multi-modal dataset for referring motion expression video segmentation, focusing on segmenting and tracking target objects in videos based on language description of objects' motions. Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems face computational bottlenecks when processing high-volume multi-camera data. Existing methods rely on explicit 3D inductive biases (BEV, occupancy, tri-plane representations) which may not be optimal for scalability and efficiency.

Method: Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. It's geometry-agnostic, learning compact scene representations directly from data without explicit 3D priors, and compresses visual input for LLM-based policy models.

Result: On a 20,000-hour driving dataset, Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while significantly improving driving performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The scene tokens also develop emergent scene decomposition capabilities without explicit supervision.

Conclusion: Flex challenges the assumption that 3D priors are necessary for autonomous driving, showing that data-driven joint encoding offers a more scalable, efficient, and effective path for future systems.

Abstract: We present Flex, an efficient and effective scene encoder that addresses the computational bottleneck of processing high-volume multi-camera data in end-to-end autonomous driving. Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that these compact scene tokens develop an emergent capability for scene decomposition without any explicit supervision. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that 3D priors are necessary, demonstrating that a data-driven, joint encoding strategy offers a more scalable, efficient and effective path for future autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing All-in-One Image Restoration methods fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations, limiting their effectiveness across diverse degradation scenarios.

Method: ClusIR uses two key components: 1) Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) that disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation for discriminative perception and stable routing, and 2) Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM) that leverages cluster-guided priors for adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation to refine structural and textural representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that ClusIR achieves competitive performance across various degradation scenarios, demonstrating remarkable restoration results for a wide range of degradations.

Conclusion: ClusIR successfully bridges semantic degradation cues with frequency-domain modulation through cluster-guided synergy, enabling adaptive and effective image restoration across diverse degradation types with improved fidelity.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) aims to recover high-quality images from diverse degradations within a unified framework. However, existing methods often fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt their restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations. To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing. Meanwhile, DAFMM leverages the cluster-guided priors to perform adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation, collaboratively refining structural and textural representations for higher restoration fidelity. The cluster-guided synergy seamlessly bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation, empowering ClusIR to attain remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks validate that ClusIR reaches competitive performance under several scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised pre-training has transformed foundation models for languages, 2D images, and videos, but remains largely unexplored for learning 3D-aware representations from multi-view images. Current methods like RayZer infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis rather than operating directly in 3D space.

Method: E-RayZer performs self-supervised 3D reconstruction with explicit geometry directly in 3D space, eliminating shortcut solutions. It introduces a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an unsupervised manner to ensure convergence and scalability.

Result: E-RayZer significantly outperforms RayZer on pose estimation, matches or sometimes surpasses fully supervised reconstruction models like VGGT. Its learned representations outperform leading visual pre-training models (DINOv3, CroCo v2, VideoMAE V2, and RayZer) when transferring to 3D downstream tasks.

Conclusion: E-RayZer establishes a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training by learning truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images through explicit 3D reconstruction, offering geometrically grounded representations that excel in 3D downstream tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training has revolutionized foundation models for languages, individual 2D images and videos, but remains largely unexplored for learning 3D-aware representations from multi-view images. In this paper, we present E-RayZer, a self-supervised large 3D Vision model that learns truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images. Unlike prior self-supervised methods such as RayZer that infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis, E-RayZer operates directly in 3D space, performing self-supervised 3D reconstruction with Explicit geometry. This formulation eliminates shortcut solutions and yields representations that are geometrically grounded. To ensure convergence and scalability, we introduce a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an entirely unsupervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that E-RayZer significantly outperforms RayZer on pose estimation, matches or sometimes surpasses fully supervised reconstruction models such as VGGT. Furthermore, its learned representations outperform leading visual pre-training models (e.g., DINOv3, CroCo v2, VideoMAE V2, and RayZer) when transferring to 3D downstream tasks, establishing E-RayZer as a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training.

TL;DR: Group Diffusion enables collaborative image generation by sharing attention across multiple images during inference, improving quality through cross-sample attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous diffusion models generate images independently at inference, missing potential benefits from collaborative generation. The authors explore whether samples can be generated collaboratively rather than independently.

Method: Propose Group Diffusion that unlocks attention mechanism to be shared across images (not just within patches of a single image). This enables joint denoising of multiple images at inference time, learning both intra-image and inter-image correspondence.

Result: Shows clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Introduces qualitative measure that correlates with FID.

Conclusion: Cross-sample inference is an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling. GroupDiff reveals benefits of collaborative generation through shared attention across images.

Abstract: In this work, we explore an untapped signal in diffusion model inference. While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rather than limited to just the patches within an image. This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a qualitative measure to capture this behavior and show that its strength closely correlates with FID. Built on standard diffusion transformers, our GroupDiff achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Our work reveals cross-sample inference as an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling.

TL;DR: Omni-Attribute: An open-vocabulary image attribute encoder that learns disentangled, attribute-specific representations for precise visual concept personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual concept personalization methods use holistic embeddings that entangle multiple visual factors, causing information leakage and incoherent synthesis when trying to isolate single attributes like identity, expression, lighting, or style.

Method: Joint data-model design: (1) curates semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive/negative attributes to explicitly teach what to preserve/suppress; (2) adopts dual-objective training balancing generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation with high-fidelity attribute-specific embeddings.

Conclusion: Omni-Attribute successfully addresses the disentanglement problem in visual concept personalization by learning attribute-specific representations through carefully designed data curation and training objectives.

Abstract: Visual concept personalization aims to transfer only specific image attributes, such as identity, expression, lighting, and style, into unseen contexts. However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate a single attribute. This often leads to information leakage and incoherent synthesis. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations. Our approach jointly designs the data and model: (i) we curate semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive and negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; and (ii) we adopt a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement. The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

### [132] [Empowering Dynamic Urban Navigation with Stereo and Mid-Level Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10956)
*Wentao Zhou,Xuweiyi Chen,Vignesh Rajagopal,Jeffrey Chen,Rohan Chandra,Zezhou Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoWalker improves robot navigation foundation models by adding stereo vision and mid-level vision modules (depth estimation, tracking) instead of relying solely on monocular vision, achieving better performance with far less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current navigation foundation models (NFMs) rely on monocular vision and ignore mid-level vision modules, assuming vision capabilities will emerge implicitly. This requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that's difficult to obtain, especially in dynamic/unstructured settings where precise geometric understanding is needed. Monocular vision has depth-scale ambiguity that limits spatial reasoning.

Method: StereoWalker augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision modules including depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. The approach also involves curating a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos.

Result: StereoWalker achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of training data, and surpasses state-of-the-art using full data. Stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input.

Conclusion: Relying solely on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient. Incorporating stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision modules significantly improves navigation foundation models' efficiency and performance.

Abstract: The success of foundation models in language and vision motivated research in fully end-to-end robot navigation foundation models (NFMs). NFMs directly map monocular visual input to control actions and ignore mid-level vision modules (tracking, depth estimation, etc) entirely. While the assumption that vision capabilities will emerge implicitly is compelling, it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain. The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient.
  We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data. We also observe that stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneMaker: A decoupled 3D scene generation framework that separates de-occlusion from object generation and uses unified pose estimation with global-local attention mechanisms to handle severe occlusion and open-set scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with producing high-quality geometry and accurate poses simultaneously under severe occlusion and open-set settings due to insufficient de-occlusion and pose estimation priors.

Method: 1) Decouple de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, enhancing it with image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets for diverse occlusion patterns. 2) Propose unified pose estimation model integrating global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention. 3) Construct open-set 3D scene dataset to extend pose estimation generalization.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate superiority of the decoupled framework on both indoor and open-set scenes.

Conclusion: SceneMaker effectively addresses occlusion and open-set challenges in 3D scene generation through decoupled architecture and enhanced pose estimation, with released code and datasets.

Abstract: We propose a decoupled 3D scene generation framework called SceneMaker in this work. Due to the lack of sufficient open-set de-occlusion and pose estimation priors, existing methods struggle to simultaneously produce high-quality geometry and accurate poses under severe occlusion and open-set settings. To address these issues, we first decouple the de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, and enhance it by leveraging image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets for much more diverse open-set occlusion patterns. Then, we propose a unified pose estimation model that integrates global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention to improve accuracy. Besides, we construct an open-set 3D scene dataset to further extend the generalization of the pose estimation model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decoupled framework on both indoor and open-set scenes. Our codes and datasets is released at https://idea-research.github.io/SceneMaker/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldLens is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating generative world models in embodied AI, assessing visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability across five dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative world models create visually convincing 4D driving environments but often fail physically or behaviorally, lacking unified evaluation methods to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control.

Method: Introduces WorldLens benchmark spanning five aspects: Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference. Also creates WorldLens-26K dataset with human-annotated videos and numerical scores, and develops WorldLens-Agent evaluation model distilled from human annotations for scalable, explainable scoring.

Result: No existing world model excels universally across all dimensions - models with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. The benchmark reveals trade-offs between different aspects of world generation.

Conclusion: WorldLens establishes a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity, standardizing evaluation of generative world models not just by visual appearance but by behavioral realism and functional reliability.

Abstract: Generative world models are reshaping embodied AI, enabling agents to synthesize realistic 4D driving environments that look convincing but often fail physically or behaviorally. Despite rapid progress, the field still lacks a unified way to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control. We introduce WorldLens, a full-spectrum benchmark evaluating how well a model builds, understands, and behaves within its generated world. It spans five aspects -- Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference -- jointly covering visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability. Across these dimensions, no existing world model excels universally: those with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. To align objective metrics with human judgment, we further construct WorldLens-26K, a large-scale dataset of human-annotated videos with numerical scores and textual rationales, and develop WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from these annotations to enable scalable, explainable scoring. Together, the benchmark, dataset, and agent form a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity -- standardizing how future models are judged not only by how real they look, but by how real they behave.

### [135] [StereoSpace: Depth-Free Synthesis of Stereo Geometry via End-to-End Diffusion in a Canonical Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10959)
*Tjark Behrens,Anton Obukhov,Bingxin Ke,Fabio Tosi,Matteo Poggi,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoSpace is a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that uses viewpoint conditioning instead of explicit depth or warping, achieving state-of-the-art results with a novel evaluation protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stereo generation methods often rely on explicit depth estimation or warping operations, which can be limited in handling complex scenes with disocclusions, non-Lambertian surfaces, and layered geometry. The paper aims to develop a more robust and scalable approach that doesn't require explicit geometric priors.

Method: StereoSpace uses a diffusion-based framework with viewpoint conditioning to model geometry implicitly. It operates in a canonical rectified space where the conditioning guides the generator to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. The method avoids explicit depth estimation or warping operations entirely.

Result: StereoSpace outperforms other methods across warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories. It achieves sharp parallax and strong robustness on challenging scenes including layered and non-Lambertian surfaces. The paper also introduces a novel evaluation protocol with iSQoE for perceptual comfort and MEt3R for geometric consistency.

Conclusion: Viewpoint-conditioned diffusion represents a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation that can handle complex real-world scenes without requiring explicit geometric priors or warping operations.

Abstract: We introduce StereoSpace, a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that models geometry purely through viewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping. A canonical rectified space and the conditioning guide the generator to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. To ensure fair and leakage-free evaluation, we introduce an end-to-end protocol that excludes any ground truth or proxy geometry estimates at test time. The protocol emphasizes metrics reflecting downstream relevance: iSQoE for perceptual comfort and MEt3R for geometric consistency. StereoSpace surpasses other methods from the warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories, achieving sharp parallax and strong robustness on layered and non-Lambertian scenes. This establishes viewpoint-conditioned diffusion as a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new class of watermarking schemes using probabilistic automata that address limitations of existing methods, offering both practical efficiency with exponential generation diversity and theoretical undetectability guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking schemes for language models have limitations: some achieve distortion-free embedding and robustness to edit-distance attacks but suffer from limited generation diversity and high detection overhead. Recent research has focused on undetectability, ensuring watermarks remain difficult for adversaries to detect and spoof.

Method: The authors introduce a new class of watermarking schemes constructed through probabilistic automata. They present two instantiations: (1) a practical scheme with exponential generation diversity and computational efficiency, and (2) a theoretical construction with formal undetectability guarantees under cryptographic assumptions.

Result: Extensive experiments on LLaMA-3B and Mistral-7B validate the superior performance of the proposed scheme in terms of robustness and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The probabilistic automata-based watermarking approach successfully addresses key limitations of previous methods, offering both practical efficiency with exponential generation diversity and theoretical undetectability guarantees, making it a promising solution for language model watermarking.

Abstract: A recent watermarking scheme for language models achieves distortion-free embedding and robustness to edit-distance attacks. However, it suffers from limited generation diversity and high detection overhead.

In this work, we introduce a new class of watermarking schemes constructed through probabilistic automata. We present two instantiations: (i) a practical scheme with exponential generation diversity and computational efficiency, and (ii) a theoretical construction with formal undetectability guarantees under cryptographic assumptions.

### [137] [Metaphor-based Jailbreaking Attacks on Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10766)
*Chenyu Zhang,Yiwen Ma,Lanjun Wang,Wenhui Li,Yi Tu,An-An Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MJA is a metaphor-based jailbreaking attack for text-to-image models that bypasses diverse defense mechanisms without prior knowledge of defense types, using LLM-based multi-agent generation and adversarial prompt optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreaking attacks assume knowledge of deployed defense types, limiting effectiveness against unknown or diverse defense mechanisms in T2I models.

Method: MJA uses two modules: 1) LLM-based Multi-Agent Generation (MLAG) that decomposes metaphor-based prompt generation into metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation using three LLM agents; 2) Adversarial Prompt Optimization (APO) that trains a surrogate model to predict attack results and uses an acquisition strategy to identify optimal prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments on T2I models with various external and internal defense mechanisms show MJA outperforms six baseline methods, achieving stronger attack performance while using fewer queries.

Conclusion: MJA effectively bypasses diverse defense mechanisms without prior knowledge, revealing critical safety vulnerabilities in T2I models and demonstrating the need for more robust defenses.

Abstract: Text-to-image~(T2I) models commonly incorporate defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of sensitive images. Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attacks have shown that adversarial prompts can effectively bypass these mechanisms and induce T2I models to produce sensitive content, revealing critical safety vulnerabilities. However, existing attack methods implicitly assume that the attacker knows the type of deployed defenses, which limits their effectiveness against unknown or diverse defense mechanisms. In this work, we introduce \textbf{MJA}, a \textbf{m}etaphor-based \textbf{j}ailbreaking \textbf{a}ttack method inspired by the Taboo game, aiming to effectively and efficiently attack diverse defense mechanisms without prior knowledge of their type by generating metaphor-based adversarial prompts. Specifically, MJA consists of two modules: an LLM-based multi-agent generation module~(MLAG) and an adversarial prompt optimization module~(APO). MLAG decomposes the generation of metaphor-based adversarial prompts into three subtasks: metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation. Subsequently, MLAG coordinates three LLM-based agents to generate diverse adversarial prompts by exploring various metaphors and contexts. To enhance attack efficiency, APO first trains a surrogate model to predict the attack results of adversarial prompts and then designs an acquisition strategy to adaptively identify optimal adversarial prompts. Extensive experiments on T2I models with various external and internal defense mechanisms demonstrate that MJA outperforms six baseline methods, achieving stronger attack performance while using fewer queries.

Motivation: LLMs and generative search systems are used by diverse populations with varying preferences, but there's no mechanism to evaluate whether custom instructions are being followed effectively.

Method: Offscript is an automated auditing tool that efficiently identifies potential instruction following failures in LLMs. The study analyzed custom instructions sourced from Reddit.

Result: Offscript detected potential deviations from instructed behavior in 86.4% of conversations, with 22.2% confirmed as material violations through human review.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative search systems are increasingly used for information seeking by diverse populations with varying preferences for knowledge sourcing and presentation. While users can customize LLM behavior through custom instructions and behavioral prompts, no mechanism exists to evaluate whether these instructions are being followed effectively. We present Offscript, an automated auditing tool that efficiently identifies potential instruction following failures in LLMs. In a pilot study analyzing custom instructions sourced from Reddit, Offscript detected potential deviations from instructed behavior in 86.4% of conversations, 22.2% of which were confirmed as material violations through human review. Our findings suggest that automated auditing serves as a viable approach for evaluating compliance to behavioral instructions related to information seeking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban regeneration faces significant challenges in urbanization contexts, requiring adaptive approaches to meet evolving needs. Current planning methods lack continuous feedback loops and dynamic responsiveness to changing urban conditions.

Method: Proposes Cyclical Urban Planning (CUP) - a multi-agent LLM framework with three components: (1) Planning agents generate/refine urban plans using contextual data, (2) Living agents simulate resident behaviors/interactions to model urban life, and (3) Judging agents evaluate plan effectiveness and provide iterative feedback. This creates a closed-loop cyclical process.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness as a continuous and adaptive planning process, showing it can dynamically respond to urban needs through the cyclical approach.

Conclusion: CUP represents a new paradigm for urban planning that leverages LLMs to create a dynamic, responsive, and adaptive planning approach through continuous generation, evaluation, and refinement cycles, addressing the challenges of urban regeneration in evolving urban contexts.

Abstract: Urban regeneration presents significant challenges within the context of urbanization, requiring adaptive approaches to tackle evolving needs. Leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs), we propose Cyclical Urban Planning (CUP), a new paradigm that continuously generates, evaluates, and refines urban plans in a closed-loop. Specifically, our multi-agent LLM-based framework consists of three key components: (1) Planning, where LLM agents generate and refine urban plans based on contextual data; (2) Living, where agents simulate the behaviors and interactions of residents, modeling life in the urban environment; and (3) Judging, which involves evaluating plan effectiveness and providing iterative feedback for improvement. The cyclical process enables a dynamic and responsive planning approach. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework as a continuous and adaptive planning process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based extraction tools struggle with scientific literature's unique challenges: long-context documents, multi-modal content, inconsistent information across publications, and rapidly changing data schemas that make system re-architecture difficult.

Method: SciEx is a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design enables extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms.

Result: The framework was evaluated on datasets spanning three scientific topics and demonstrated the ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently, providing practical insights into LLM-based pipeline strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: SciEx addresses key challenges in scientific information extraction by offering a flexible, modular approach that can adapt to changing schemas and handle the complexities of scientific literature better than existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly touted as powerful tools for automating scientific information extraction. However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. We evaluate SciEx on datasets spanning three scientific topics for its ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently. Our findings provide practical insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM-based pipelines.

*Logan Robbins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PDT introduces a parallel decoder transformer with speculative note conditioning adapters that enable parallel generation streams to coordinate via a shared latent space, achieving 77.8% precision in coverage prediction without modifying base model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in LLMs creates latency bottlenecks that scale linearly with output length. Existing parallelization methods like Skeleton-of-Thought suffer from coherence drift due to lack of cross-stream communication between parallel generation streams.

Method: PDT uses lightweight Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC) adapters injected into a frozen pre-trained model, allowing parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared dynamic latent space. Coordination is formulated as a speculative consensus problem where streams broadcast semantic "notes" to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head.

Result: PDT achieves 77.8% precision in coverage prediction and recovers approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights of a frozen 20B-parameter backbone, validated on a 50,000-step curriculum.

Conclusion: PDT establishes a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation by embedding coordination primitives directly into inference while keeping the base model frozen.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) is inherently sequential, creating a latency bottleneck that scales linearly with output length. While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.
  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \textbf{77.8\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights. This establishes PDT as a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation.

*Devanshu Sahoo,Manish Prasad,Vasudev Majhi,Jahnvi Singh,Vinay Chamola,Yash Sinha,Murari Mandal,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how adversarial PDF manipulation can fool LLM-based peer review systems into flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept," introducing a new metric called WAVS to measure vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the rapid integration of LLMs in scientific peer review through both individual reviewer use (Lazy Reviewer hypothesis) and institutional AI systems. There's a need to understand the robustness of these systems against adversarial attacks aimed at manipulating acceptance decisions.

Method: Researchers curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies for adversarial PDF manipulation. They evaluated these attacks across 13 Language Models including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek, using their novel WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score) metric to measure system vulnerability.

Result: Results show that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models. The attacks were effective at flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept" across multiple LLM systems.

Conclusion: LLM-based peer review systems are vulnerable to adversarial PDF manipulation, posing significant security risks to scientific evaluation processes. The authors will release their dataset and injection framework to facilitate further research on this critical issue.

Abstract: The landscape of scientific peer review is rapidly evolving with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the "Lazy Reviewer" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these "LLM-as-a-Judge" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept," for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models. We will release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate more research on this topic.

*Zouying Cao,Jiaji Deng,Li Yu,Weikang Zhou,Zhaoyang Liu,Bolin Ding,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReMe is a framework for LLM agents that transforms procedural memory from passive storage to active, self-evolving knowledge through distillation, adaptive reuse, and utility-based refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent memory frameworks suffer from "passive accumulation" where memory is treated as a static archive, failing to bridge the gap between storage and dynamic reasoning needed for lifelong learning.

Method: Three key mechanisms: 1) Multi-faceted distillation extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers, and generating comparative insights; 2) Context-adaptive reuse tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; 3) Utility-based refinement autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool.

Result: ReMe establishes new SOTA on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld benchmarks. Shows memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B with ReMe outperforms larger memoryless Qwen3-14B, demonstrating computation-efficient lifelong learning.

Conclusion: ReMe bridges the gap between static memory storage and dynamic reasoning, enabling self-evolving memory that provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning in LLM agents.

Abstract: Procedural memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to internalize "how-to" knowledge, theoretically reducing redundant trial-and-error. However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a "passive accumulation" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning. We release our code and the $\texttt{reme.library}$ dataset to facilitate further research.

### [145] [Replace, Don't Expand: Mitigating Context Dilution in Multi-Hop RAG via Fixed-Budget Evidence Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10787)
*Moshe Lahmy,Roi Yozevitch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAL-RAG is a training-free controller that replaces rather than expands context to fight context dilution in multi-hop RAG queries, improving answer correctness and evidence precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems fail on multi-hop queries when initial retrieval misses bridge facts, and corrective approaches that add more context cause context dilution where distractors crowd out relevant information.

Method: SEAL-RAG uses a "replace, don't expand" strategy with a SEARCH → EXTRACT → ASSESS → LOOP cycle: performs entity-anchored extraction to build gap specifications, triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses entity-first ranking to swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence under fixed retrieval depth k.

Result: On HotpotQA (k=3), SEAL improves answer correctness by +3-13 pp and evidence precision by +12-18 pp over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA (k=5), it outperforms Adaptive-k by +8.0 pp in accuracy and maintains 96% evidence precision compared to 22% for CRAG. Gains are statistically significant (p<0.001).

Conclusion: SEAL-RAG's fixed-k replacement strategy yields predictable cost profile while optimizing top-k slots for precision rather than breadth, effectively addressing context dilution in multi-hop RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often fail on multi-hop queries when the initial retrieval misses a bridge fact. Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\textbf{S}earch $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E}xtract $\rightarrow$ \textbf{A}ssess $\rightarrow$ \textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \textbf{HotpotQA} and \textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \textbf{96\%} evidence precision compared to 22\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth. We release our code and data at https://github.com/mosherino/SEAL-RAG.

### [146] [Echo-CoPilot: A Multi-View, Multi-Task Agent for Echocardiography Interpretation and Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09944)
*Moein Heidari,Mohammad Amin Roohi,Armin Khosravi,Ilker Hacihaliloglu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Echo-CoPilot is an AI agent that uses a large language model to coordinate multiple specialized tools for comprehensive echocardiography analysis, outperforming existing models on benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Echocardiography interpretation is complex and manual, requiring integration of multiple views and tasks. Current AI models only handle isolated subtasks without providing unified clinical assessments.

Method: A multi-view, multi-task agent using a large language model orchestrates specialized echocardiography tools (view recognition, segmentation, measurement, disease prediction, report synthesis) in a ReAct-style loop to decompose clinician queries and generate guideline-aware answers.

Result: Achieves 50.8% accuracy on MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Can resolve challenging borderline cases using quantitative measurements and physiologic context.

Conclusion: Echo-CoPilot demonstrates effective integration of multiple AI tools for comprehensive echocardiography analysis, showing promise for clinical decision support in complex cardiovascular cases.

Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL optimization with clinically grounded rewards improves CXR VLM performance on report generation and visual grounding, while explicit thinking doesn't provide additional benefits beyond strong SFT foundation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical VLMs rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. Reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and combining RL with explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") has shown substantial gains in other domains like math and coding tasks. The authors want to investigate whether RL and thinking can similarly improve Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation in vision-language models.

Method: 1) Large-scale SFT on CXR data to build RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL; 2) Cold-start SFT stage to equip model with basic thinking ability; 3) Apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding; 4) Run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking.

Result: RL provides additional gains on both report generation and visual grounding tasks beyond strong SFT foundation. Explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. The RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both tasks under unified evaluation pipeline.

Conclusion: Clinically aligned RL serves as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs, providing measurable performance improvements for CXR interpretation tasks. While strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL optimization with task-specific rewards offers additional gains, making it a valuable approach for medical vision-language applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation in multiple aspects. However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agile Deliberation: A human-in-the-loop framework for evolving visual concept classification through iterative user refinement of borderline cases, achieving 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-in-the-loop approaches assume users have clear, stable concept understanding, but in reality users often start with vague ideas and need to iteratively refine them through "concept deliberation" - a practice discovered through interviews with content moderation experts.

Method: Operationalizes real content moderators' deliberation strategies into Agile Deliberation framework with two stages: (1) concept scoping - decomposing initial concept into structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration - surfacing semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align image classifier with user's evolving intent.

Result: Evaluated through 18 user sessions (1.5h each) rather than standard benchmarks. Achieved 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and >3% higher than manual deliberation. Participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.

Conclusion: Agile Deliberation effectively supports evolving and subjective visual concepts through structured human-in-the-loop deliberation, outperforming both automated and manual approaches while improving user experience and conceptual clarity.

Abstract: From content moderation to content curation, applications requiring vision classifiers for visual concepts are rapidly expanding. Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through "concept deliberation", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called "Agile Deliberation" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.

### [149] [BRACE: A Benchmark for Robust Audio Caption Quality Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10403)
*Tianyu Guo,Hongyu Chen,Hao Liang,Meiyi Qiang,Bohan Zeng,Linzhuang Sun,Bin Cui,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: BRACE is a new benchmark for evaluating reference-free audio caption quality, testing both CLAPScore metrics and Large Audio Language Models, revealing significant limitations in current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of systematic validation for reference-free audio caption evaluation metrics (ACEMs) like CLAPScore, and increasing use of Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) in audio-language tasks without proper benchmarking tools.

Method: Created BRACE benchmark with two sub-benchmarks: BRACE-Main for fine-grained caption comparison and BRACE-Hallucination for detecting subtle hallucinations. Constructed datasets through high-quality filtering, LLM-based corruption, and human annotation.

Result: Best CLAP-based ACEM achieves only 70.01 F1-score on BRACE-Main, while best LALM reaches just 63.19, revealing significant limitations in current approaches to audio caption evaluation.

Conclusion: BRACE benchmark exposes weaknesses in current CLAP models and LALMs for audio caption evaluation, providing valuable insights and direction for future research in audio understanding and caption quality assessment.

Abstract: Automatic audio captioning is essential for audio understanding, enabling applications such as accessibility and content indexing. However, evaluating the quality of audio captions remains a major challenge, especially in reference-free settings where high-quality ground-truth captions are unavailable. While CLAPScore is currently the most widely used reference-free Audio Caption Evaluation Metric(ACEM), its robustness under diverse conditions has not been systematically validated.
  To address this gap, we introduce BRACE, a new benchmark designed to evaluate audio caption alignment quality in a reference-free setting. BRACE is primarily designed for assessing ACEMs, and can also be extended to measure the modality alignment abilities of Large Audio Language Model(LALM). BRACE consists of two sub-benchmarks: BRACE-Main for fine-grained caption comparison and BRACE-Hallucination for detecting subtle hallucinated content. We construct these datasets through high-quality filtering, LLM-based corruption, and human annotation.
  Given the widespread adoption of CLAPScore as a reference-free ACEM and the increasing application of LALMs in audio-language tasks, we evaluate both approaches using the BRACE benchmark, testing CLAPScore across various CLAP model variants and assessing multiple LALMs.
  Notably, even the best-performing CLAP-based ACEM achieves only a 70.01 F1-score on the BRACE-Main benchmark, while the best LALM reaches just 63.19.
  By revealing the limitations of CLAP models and LALMs, our BRACE benchmark offers valuable insights into the direction of future research.

TL;DR: An autonomous six-wheeled robot uses low-energy laser beams for precise weed removal in agriculture, featuring novel suspension and 3D laser guidance with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mechanical weeding is inefficient for large fields, and herbicides damage soil ecosystems. Laser weeding with mobile robots offers a sustainable alternative for precision farming that addresses these limitations.

Method: The robot features a six-wheeled design with double four-bar suspension for stability, and uses a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism to guide low-energy laser beams toward detected weeds for removal.

Result: Field tests show the robot navigates agricultural terrain overcoming 15cm obstacles, achieves 86.2% weed detection rate at 42.5 cm/s, with 97% laser hit rate and minimal 1.54mm positional error.

Conclusion: The combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency demonstrates the robot's potential to significantly enhance precision farming practices through sustainable laser-based weed removal.

Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly utilized in agriculture to automate labor-intensive tasks such as weeding, sowing, harvesting and soil analysis. Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height. At an optimal speed of 42.5 cm/s, the robot achieves a weed detection rate of 86.2\% and operating time of 87 seconds per meter. The laser actuation mechanism maintains a minimal mean positional error of 1.54 mm, combined with a high hit rate of 97\%, ensuring effective and accurate weed removal. This combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency highlights the robot's potential for significantly enhancing precision farming practices.

TL;DR: Video foundation models (Veo) enable comprehensive robotic policy evaluation including OOD generalization and safety testing through realistic scene editing and multi-view simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video models in robotics are limited to in-distribution evaluations, lacking comprehensive testing capabilities for out-of-distribution generalization, safety constraints, and varied environmental conditions needed for robust policy assessment.

Method: Developed a generative evaluation system using Veo video foundation model optimized for robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, integrated with generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic scene variations along multiple generalization axes.

Result: The system accurately simulates edited scenes with novel objects, backgrounds, and distractors, enabling prediction of policy performance in both nominal and OOD conditions, assessment of generalization impact, and safety red teaming. Validated with 1600+ real-world evaluations across 8 policy checkpoints and 5 tasks.

Conclusion: Video foundation models can serve as comprehensive evaluation platforms for robotic policies, extending beyond in-distribution testing to enable systematic assessment of generalization capabilities, safety constraints, and performance across diverse environmental variations.

Abstract: Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.

*Kesheng Chen,Wenjian Luo,Zhenqian Zhu,Yamin Hu,Yiya Xi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BAMBO is a novel framework that automatically constructs Pareto sets for LLMs by balancing capability-efficiency trade-offs through hybrid block partitioning and Bayesian optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging techniques are inadequate for constructing Pareto sets: model-level methods produce sparse suboptimal solutions, while layer-wise approaches suffer from the "curse of dimensionality" making the search space computationally intractable.

Method: BAMBO introduces Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning formulated as a 1D clustering problem using dynamic programming to balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, reducing dimensionality while preserving granularity. The framework operates within an evolutionary loop driven by q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function.

Result: Experiments show BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

Conclusion: BAMBO effectively resolves the dichotomy between coarse-grained and fine-grained merging techniques by making Pareto set construction tractable through adaptive block-wise optimization, advancing LLM capability-efficiency trade-off navigation.

Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

*Keito Inoshita,Xiaokang Zhou,Akira Kawai,Katsutoshi Yada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIEGAD is a data augmentation framework that uses LLMs to generate synthetic data for semantically uncovered regions, addressing data scarcity and class imbalance through cluster-conditioned generation with directional control and quality filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deep learning deployment faces data scarcity and label imbalance, creating semantically uncovered regions in data distributions that cause misclassification near boundaries and unstable model behavior. Existing LLM-based augmentation lacks integrated directional control, domain alignment, and quality control.

Method: CIEGAD uses cluster conditioning to create domain profiles, hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation to prioritize underrepresented areas, interpolative/extrapolative synthesis for directional control, and geometry-constrained filtering with LLM-as-a-Judge for quality control.

Result: Experiments show CIEGAD effectively extends real-world data distribution peripheries while maintaining high alignment and semantic diversity. It consistently improves F1 and recall in long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks.

Conclusion: CIEGAD provides a practical data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving real-world data alignment, achieving harmony between distributional consistency, diversity, and quality.

Abstract: In practical deep learning deployment, the scarcity of data and the imbalance of label distributions often lead to semantically uncovered regions within the real-world data distribution, hindering model training and causing misclassification near class boundaries as well as unstable behaviors in peripheral areas. Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality. These results indicate that CIEGAD serves as a practically oriented data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving alignment with real-world data.

TL;DR: LLMs can be augmented to think, listen, and generate outputs simultaneously using rotary embeddings, enabling real-time reasoning without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs must stop thinking before responding, making them incompatible with real-time interactive applications like voice assistants. Humans can think and act asynchronously while processing information.

Method: Uses properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs without additional training.

Result: Reduces time to first non-thinking token from minutes to ≤5 seconds, with 6-11x reduction in overall real-time delays across math, commonsense, and safety reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs can be augmented to operate with asynchronous thinking capabilities similar to humans, enabling real-time reasoning for interactive applications.

Abstract: Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x.

*Mingzhi Chen,Taiming Lu,Jiachen Zhu,Mingjie Sun,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Derf, a point-wise function using rescaled Gaussian CDF, outperforms existing normalization layers across multiple domains and offers better generalization for normalization-free Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to find point-wise function designs that can surpass Dynamic Tanh (DyT), which showed normalization-level performance without traditional normalization layers. The researchers want to understand how intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance, and discover more effective alternatives to normalization layers.

Method: First studied how intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Then conducted large-scale search for more effective function designs. Through exploration, identified Derf(x) = erf(αx + s) as the most performant design, where erf(x) is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function.

Result: Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across multiple domains: vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. The performance gains come from improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity.

Conclusion: Derf's simplicity and stronger performance make it a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures, offering an effective alternative to traditional normalization layers.

Abstract: Although normalization layers have long been viewed as indispensable components of deep learning architectures, the recent introduction of Dynamic Tanh (DyT) has demonstrated that alternatives are possible. The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches normalization-level performance; this work seeks further for function designs that can surpass it. We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \mathrm{erf}(αx + s)$, where $\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures.

*Ragja Palakkadavath,Hung Le,Thanh Nguyen-Tang,Svetha Venkatesh,Sunil Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDG with latent space inversion and important weight aggregation achieves better generalization and privacy with less communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FedDG methods improve generalization but compromise privacy by sharing client data statistics. Need to address privacy concerns while handling non-i.i.d. client distributions.

Method: 1) Latent space inversion for domain invariance across local models while preserving privacy. 2) Important weight aggregation strategy to prioritize parameters that significantly influence local predictions during model aggregation.

Result: Superior results over state-of-the-art methods with less communication overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses privacy concerns in FedDG while improving generalization capability and reducing communication costs.

Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) addresses distribution shifts among clients in a federated learning framework. FedDG methods aggregate the parameters of locally trained client models to form a global model that generalizes to unseen clients while preserving data privacy. While improving the generalization capability of the global model, many existing approaches in FedDG jeopardize privacy by sharing statistics of client data between themselves. Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy. When clients are not \emph{i.i.d}, aggregating their local models may discard certain local adaptations. To overcome this, we propose an \textbf{important weight} aggregation strategy to prioritize parameters that significantly influence predictions of local models during aggregation. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods with less communication overhead.

*Sai Bharath Chandra Gutha,Ricardo Vinuesa,Hossein Azizpour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VML-MAP: A new algorithm using variational mode-seeking loss to guide diffusion models toward maximum a posteriori estimates for solving inverse problems without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for solving inverse problems with pre-trained diffusion models rely on approximations and are computationally expensive. There's a need for more efficient and theoretically grounded approaches.

Method: Proposes variational mode-seeking loss (VML) derived from minimizing KL divergence between diffusion posterior and measurement posterior. VML guides samples toward MAP estimates during reverse diffusion. For linear inverse problems, VML has analytical form without approximations.

Result: VML-MAP outperforms existing methods in both performance and computational efficiency across diverse image-restoration tasks on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: VML-MAP provides an effective, theoretically grounded algorithm for solving inverse problems with diffusion models, offering better performance and faster computation than existing approaches.

Abstract: A pre-trained unconditional diffusion model, combined with posterior sampling or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation techniques, can solve arbitrary inverse problems without task-specific training or fine-tuning. However, existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods often rely on modeling approximations and can be computationally demanding. In this work, we propose the variational mode-seeking loss (VML), which, when minimized during each reverse diffusion step, guides the generated sample towards the MAP estimate. VML arises from a novel perspective of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{x}_t)$ and the measurement posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{y})$, where $\mathbf{y}$ denotes the measurement. Importantly, for linear inverse problems, VML can be analytically derived and need not be approximated. Based on further theoretical insights, we propose VML-MAP, an empirically effective algorithm for solving inverse problems, and validate its efficacy over existing methods in both performance and computational time, through extensive experiments on diverse image-restoration tasks across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: CB-SAE improves sparse autoencoders by pruning low-utility neurons and adding concept bottlenecks, boosting interpretability by 32.1% and steerability by 14.5% for LVLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have limitations: many neurons have low interpretability/steerability, and unsupervised learning often misses user-desired concepts, limiting practical utility for mechanistic interpretability and model steering.

Method: Propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to user-defined concepts.

Result: CB-SAE improves interpretability by +32.1% and steerability by +14.5% across LVLMs and image generation tasks compared to standard SAEs.

Conclusion: CB-SAE addresses key limitations of SAEs by combining neuron pruning with concept bottleneck augmentation, creating more practical tools for interpretability and steering in large vision-language models.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) promise a unified approach for mechanistic interpretability, concept discovery, and model steering in LLMs and LVLMs. However, realizing this potential requires that the learned features be both interpretable and steerable. To that end, we introduce two new computationally inexpensive interpretability and steerability metrics and conduct a systematic analysis on LVLMs. Our analysis uncovers two observations; (i) a majority of SAE neurons exhibit either low interpretability or low steerability or both, rendering them ineffective for downstream use; and (ii) due to the unsupervised nature of SAEs, user-desired concepts are often absent in the learned dictionary, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set. The resulting CB-SAE improves interpretability by +32.1% and steerability by +14.5% across LVLMs and image generation tasks. We will make our code and model weights available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Binary encoding enables neural networks to extrapolate periodic functions beyond training bounds using Normalized Base-2 Encoding (NB2E).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks typically struggle with extrapolation beyond their training data, especially for periodic functions. The paper aims to address this limitation by exploring how input encoding can enable better extrapolation capabilities.

Method: Introduces Normalized Base-2 Encoding (NB2E) for encoding continuous numerical values. Uses vanilla multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with this encoding to learn periodic signals without prior knowledge of their functional form.

Result: MLPs with NB2E successfully extrapolate diverse periodic signals beyond training bounds. Internal activation analysis reveals NB2E induces bit-phase representations that allow networks to learn signal structure independently of position.

Conclusion: Binary encoding through NB2E enables neural networks to effectively extrapolate periodic functions by creating internal representations that capture signal structure independent of position, overcoming traditional extrapolation limitations.

Abstract: We report the discovery that binary encoding allows neural networks to extrapolate periodic functions beyond their training bounds. We introduce Normalized Base-2 Encoding (NB2E) as a method for encoding continuous numerical values and demonstrate that, using this input encoding, vanilla multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) successfully extrapolate diverse periodic signals without prior knowledge of their functional form. Internal activation analysis reveals that NB2E induces bit-phase representations, enabling MLPs to learn and extrapolate signal structure independently of position.

*Yiyang Lu,Qiao Sun,Xianbang Wang,Zhicheng Jiang,Hanhong Zhao,Kaiming He*

TL;DR: BiFlow introduces a bidirectional normalizing flow framework that removes the need for exact analytic inverses, enabling more flexible architectures and faster sampling while maintaining competitive generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard normalizing flows require exact analytic inverses, which constrains architecture design and causes causal decoding bottlenecks in recent Transformer-based autoregressive flow methods like TARFlow.

Method: BiFlow learns a separate reverse model that approximates the noise-to-data inverse mapping instead of requiring exact analytic inverses, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures.

Result: On ImageNet, BiFlow improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude compared to causal decoding methods, achieving state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation methods.

Conclusion: BiFlow revitalizes normalizing flows by removing the exact inverse constraint, offering faster sampling and better performance, potentially drawing more attention to this classical generative modeling paradigm.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) have been established as a principled framework for generative modeling. Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation ("1-NFE") methods. Following recent encouraging progress on NFs, we hope our work will draw further attention to this classical paradigm.
