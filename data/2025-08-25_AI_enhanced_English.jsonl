This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the\nmultimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a\ntext-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately\n9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes\nfrom a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples\nrequire textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,\nfor correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via\nhuman evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and\nupon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in\nMIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across\nall models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with\nan accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific\nrelevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings\nhighlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets\nand emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models\neffectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Text-only LLMs outperform multimodal models on intent detection due to strong textual bias in datasets.

Although sarcasm\nand hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether\nintegrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech\ndetection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating\nsamples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two\ntraining strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a\nCNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training\napproach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.\nThe second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for\nsarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm\npre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and\nF1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by\n7.8% when tested only on implicit samples.
