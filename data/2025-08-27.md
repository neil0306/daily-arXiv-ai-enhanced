### [1] [Semantic Attractors and the Emergence of Meaning: Towards a Teleological Model of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18290)
*Hans-Joachim Rudolph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a semantic AGI framework using complex-valued meaning spaces and semantic attractors instead of statistical prediction, focusing on intentional meaning formation through tensorial transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond statistical language models and develop a theoretical foundation for AGI that can genuinely understand and form meaning through intentional semantic operations rather than just predicting tokens.

Method: Uses complex-valued meaning spaces with cyclic operations involving imaginary unit i, recursive tensorial transformations, semantic attractors (teleological operators), gradient flows, tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics.

Result: Develops a mathematical framework capable of modeling complex semantic phenomena like irony, homonymy, and ambiguity through rotational semantic structures and intentional guidance toward semantic coherence.

Conclusion: True meaning emerges from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence rather than simulation, requiring a fundamentally new cognitive architecture designed to shape language rather than just predict it.

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

### [2] [LLMs Can't Handle Peer Pressure: Crumbling under Multi-Agent Social Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18321)
*Maojia Song,Tej Deep Pala,Weisheng Jin,Amir Zadeh,Chuan Li,Dorien Herremans,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KAIROS benchmark tests LLMs' trust formation, misinformation resistance, and peer integration in multi-agent quiz contests, showing GRPO with multi-agent context achieves best performance but reduces social influence robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs form trust from previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during multi-agent interactions - key factors for achieving collective intelligence in complex social dynamics.

Method: Developed KAIROS benchmark simulating quiz contests with peer agents of varying reliability, controlling conditions like expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers. Evaluated prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning (GRPO) across multiple models.

Result: GRPO with multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained reasoning achieved the best overall performance, but decreased robustness to social influence compared to Base models.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into LLM behavior in multi-agent systems and demonstrates effective mitigation strategies, though trade-offs exist between performance and social influence robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

### [3] [Not All Visitors are Bilingual: A Measurement Study of the Multilingual Web from an Accessibility Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18328)
*Masudul Hasan Masud Bhuiyan,Matteo Varvello,Yasir Zaki,Cristian-Alexandru Staicu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangCrUX dataset reveals widespread accessibility issues in multilingual websites where language hints don't match visible content, limiting screen reader effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual web content creates barriers for visually impaired users as assistive technologies often misrender non-Latin scripts, but large-scale studies have been limited by lack of comprehensive datasets.

Method: Created LangCrUX dataset of 120,000 popular websites across 12 non-Latin script languages and conducted systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility, then proposed Kizuki language-aware automated testing extension.

Result: Found widespread neglect of accessibility hints that fail to reflect language diversity of visible content, reducing screen reader effectiveness and limiting web accessibility.

Conclusion: Proposed Kizuki extension addresses language-inconsistent accessibility hints to improve multilingual web accessibility for users with visual impairments.

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

### [4] [Language-Specific Layer Matters: Efficient Multilingual Enhancement for Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18381)
*Yuchun Fan,Yilin Wang,Yongyu Mu,Lei Huang,Bei Li,Xiaocheng Feng,Tong Xiao,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLAST is an efficient fine-tuning method that improves multilingual capabilities of large vision-language models by identifying and precisely tuning language-specific layers using only 14% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models exhibit imbalanced multilingual capabilities despite strong visual understanding, and there's a need for efficient multilingual enhancement methods.

Method: PLAST identifies layers involved in multilingual understanding through language-specific neuron activation monitoring, then precisely fine-tunes these layers using question-translation pairs for multilingual alignment.

Result: PLAST significantly improves multilingual capabilities on MM-Bench and MMMB benchmarks while being highly efficient, and generalizes well to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances multilingual visual understanding by facilitating language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers through precise, parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

### [5] [Backprompting: Leveraging Synthetic Production Data for Health Advice Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18384)
*Kellen Tan Cheng,Anna Lisa Gentile,Chad DeLuca,Guang-Jie Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Backprompting method generates production-like labeled data for health advice guardrails, combined with human-in-the-loop clustering to improve detector training and outperform GPT-4o with 400x fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of acquiring production-quality labeled data for LLM guardrails development, particularly for health advice detection where real LLM output data is scarce before deployment.

Method: Propose backprompting to generate synthetic production-like labeled data, paired with sparse human-in-the-loop clustering for labeling. Create parallel corpus resembling real LLM output and infuse existing datasets with synthetic examples.

Result: The detector outperforms GPT-4o by up to 3.73% in health advice identification, despite having 400x fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Backprompting with human-in-the-loop clustering effectively generates production-like training data for LLM guardrails, enabling robust detector development that can outperform much larger models in specialized tasks like health advice detection.

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

### [6] [Integral Transformer: Denoising Attention, Not Too Much Not Too Little](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18387)
*Ivan Kobyzev,Abbas Ghaddar,Dingtao Hu,Boxing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Integral Transformer addresses attention noise in softmax self-attention by integrating signals from logit distribution, preserving useful special token information while denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically uninformative tokens like special tokens and punctuation, causing attention noise. Existing methods with negative attention scores risk discarding useful information.

Method: Proposes Integral Transformer with novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution.

Result: Outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. Effectively balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

Conclusion: Integral Transformer successfully mitigates attention noise while preserving critical special token contributions, with analysis showing vanilla self-attention works better in lower layers while Integral Transformer excels in upper layers.

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

### [7] [Latent Self-Consistency for Reliable Majority-Set Selection in Short- and Long-Answer Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18395)
*Jeong-seok Oh,Jay-yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent Self-Consistency (LSC) is a new method that uses learnable token embeddings to select the most semantically consistent response from LLM outputs, working effectively across both short-form and long-form reasoning tasks with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing consistency methods like Self-Consistency work well for short-form QA but fail on long-form responses, while Universal Self-Consistency and WUCS extend to long-form but lose accuracy on short-form benchmarks. There's a need for a universal approach that maintains accuracy across both formats.

Method: LSC selects the most semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. It generates lightweight summary tokens through forward generation, adding less than 1% inference time without requiring model architecture changes.

Result: LSC outperforms SC, USC, and WUCS across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (MATH, MMLU, TruthfulQA) on all formats while maintaining negligible computational overhead. It also provides well-calibrated confidence estimates with low Expected Calibration Error.

Conclusion: LSC is a practical consistency-selection method that works reliably across different answer formats, offering both improved performance and well-calibrated confidence estimates with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.

### [8] [Can Out-of-Distribution Evaluations Uncover Reliance on Shortcuts? A Case Study in Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18407)
*Michal Štefánik,Timothee Mickus,Marek Kadlčík,Michal Spiegel,Josef Kuchař*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Paper challenges the assumption that out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluations reliably capture real-world failure modes in AI models, particularly in question-answering systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question whether current OOD evaluation methods effectively identify model failures related to spurious feature reliance and prediction shortcuts in real-world deployments.

Method: Confronts OOD evaluation results with documented failure modes in QA models, analyzes how different OOD datasets estimate model robustness to shortcuts, and examines shortcut sharing patterns across datasets.

Result: Found that OOD datasets vary significantly in quality for estimating shortcut robustness, with some performing worse than simple in-distribution evaluations. Spurious shortcuts are often shared across ID and OOD datasets, and dataset quality for training vs evaluation can be disconnected.

Conclusion: Highlights limitations of common OOD-based generalization evaluations and provides methodology and recommendations for more robust generalization assessment within and beyond QA.

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

### [9] [How Reliable are LLMs for Reasoning on the Re-ranking task?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18444)
*Nafis Tanveer Islam,Zhiming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of how different LLM training methods affect semantic understanding and explainability in re-ranking tasks, particularly in domains with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show improved human value alignment but lack transparency, and re-ranking tasks face challenges with limited user engagement and ranking data. Need to understand which training methods provide better explainability and true semantic understanding.

Method: Utilized a small ranking dataset from environmental and Earth science domains to re-rank retrieved content, analyzing different training methods and their impact on explainable reasoning.

Result: Found that some training methods exhibit better explainability than others, suggesting that not all methods develop accurate semantic understanding - some only gain abstract knowledge for evaluation optimization.

Conclusion: Training methods significantly impact LLMs' semantic understanding and explainability in re-ranking tasks, raising questions about true reliability and highlighting the need for methods that provide transparent reasoning.

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

### [10] [Integrating gender inclusivity into large language models via instruction tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18466)
*Alina Wróblewska,Bartosz Żuk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses gender bias in Polish LLMs by tuning them with gender-inclusive data (IPIS dataset) to systematically mitigate masculine bias in language generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polish language predominantly uses masculine forms for all genders due to historical conventions, causing LLMs to inherit and reinforce this gender bias in their outputs.

Method: Tuning multilingual and Polish-specific LLMs using the IPIS dataset (human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading) and designing system prompts with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish.

Result: The approach successfully integrates gender inclusivity as an inherent feature in the tested LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B, Mistral-Nemo, Bielik, and PLLuM).

Conclusion: Provides a systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation by making gender inclusivity an inherent capability of language models.

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a
systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

### [11] [Principled Detection of Hallucinations in Large Language Models via Multiple Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18473)
*Jiawei Li,Akshayaa Magesh,Venugopal V. Veeravalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a multiple-testing-inspired method for detecting hallucinations in LLMs by framing it as a hypothesis testing problem similar to out-of-distribution detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are powerful but prone to generating confident yet incorrect or nonsensical responses (hallucinations), requiring robust detection methods.

Method: Formulates hallucination detection as a hypothesis testing problem and draws parallels to out-of-distribution detection, proposing a multiple-testing-inspired approach.

Result: Extensive experimental results validate the robustness of the proposed approach against state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The multiple-testing-inspired method provides an effective solution for detecting hallucinations in LLMs, addressing a critical limitation of current foundation models.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are
actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem
of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

### [12] [COMET-poly: Machine Translation Metric Grounded in Other Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18549)
*Maike Züfle,Vilém Zouhar,Tu Anh Dinh,Felipe Maia Polo,Jan Niehues,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes two new automated translation metrics (COMET-polycand and COMET-polyic) that incorporate additional context beyond single translations, showing significant improvements in correlation with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated translation metrics only consider source sentence and single translation, unlike humans who assess translations in context of multiple alternatives. This discrepancy may negatively impact metric performance.

Method: COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of same source sentence for comparative assessment. COMET-polyic uses translations of similar source texts with human quality scores for retrieval-based in-context learning.

Result: Adding single additional translation improved segment-level performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b correlation), with further gains from more translations. Retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yielded similar improvements (0.079 to 0.116 correlation).

Conclusion: Incorporating additional contextual information through multiple translations or retrieved examples significantly improves automated translation metric performance, better aligning with human evaluation practices.

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

### [13] [The Mind's Eye: A Multi-Faceted Reward Framework for Guiding Visual Metaphor Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18569)
*Girish A. Koushik,Fatemeh Nazarieh,Katherine Birch,Shenbin Qian,Diptesh Kanojia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-evaluating visual metaphor generation framework that uses metaphor decomposition and meaning alignment metrics, with both training-free and training-based approaches that outperform strong baselines on decomposition and alignment scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual metaphor generation requires understanding language to bind source and target concepts while preserving meaning and ensuring visual coherence, which is challenging for current methods.

Method: Proposes a framework with self-evaluation combining existing metrics with novel metaphor decomposition score and meaning alignment metric. Includes training-free pipeline with explicit S-T-M (source-target-meaning) prompt decomposition and training-based pipeline using self-evaluation reward schema without large-scale retraining.

Result: Training-free approach surpasses GPT-4o and Imagen on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores. User study shows participants preferred GPT-4o overall, but training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged Imagen on abstract metaphors. S-T-M prompting helps longer/abstract metaphors while closed models excel on short/concrete cases.

Conclusion: Structured prompting and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute. Remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling rather than core metaphor understanding.

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

### [14] [What do language models model? Transformers, automata, and the format of thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18598)
*Colin Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs model corpus statistics rather than human cognition due to architectural constraints of transformers being limited to linear processing formats, unlike human supralinear computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether large language models actually model human cognitive capacities or simply reflect the statistical patterns of their training corpora, addressing fundamental questions about what these models represent.

Method: Analyzes transformer architecture invariants and computational limitations, contrasting with human cognitive science findings about supralinear processing formats. References Liu et al. (2022)'s shortcut automata theory.

Result: Transformers support at best linear processing formats, fundamentally different from human supralinear computational capabilities, suggesting they model corpus statistics rather than human cognition.

Conclusion: LLMs have learned to use language as a 'discourse machine' through different means than humans, modeling the technology of language use rather than human cognitive processes, which is not a deflationary finding but reveals how language functions as a contextual tool.

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating electronic health records from English to Spanish is clinically important but challenging due to lack of parallel-aligned corpora and abundant unknown medical terms.

Method: Proposes NOOV system that integrates automatically learned bilingual lexicons from parallel corpora and phrase look-up tables from large biomedical knowledge resources to address unknown words and word-repeat challenges.

Result: Evaluation shows NOOV generates better EHR translations with improvements in both accuracy and fluency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: NOOV effectively addresses the challenges of EHR translation by leveraging external knowledge resources and requires minimal in-domain parallel data for training, making it practical for clinical applications.

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish
is a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a
parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address
such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine
translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus
for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from
parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large
biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and
the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT
systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of
EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

### [16] [Scaling Laws for Task-Stratified Knowledge in Post-Training Quantized Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18609)
*Chenxi Zhou,Pengfei Cao,Jiang Li,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how post-training quantization affects different LLM knowledge capabilities, revealing that memorization is more sensitive to quantization parameters than utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of comprehensive understanding about how PTQ precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities, and existing scaling laws often overlook PTQ-specific parameters and task-specific sensitivities.

Method: Conducted extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified scaling laws, disentangled LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization capabilities, and developed a unified quantitative framework incorporating model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size.

Result: Knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization.

Conclusion: The findings provide fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and guidance for developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve targeted cognitive functions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

*Cong Li,Wenchang Chai,Hejun Wu,Yan Pan,Pengxu Wei,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TBYS framework inserts proactive insights between reasoning steps to bridge the gap in LLM training data where human inner thoughts are missing, improving complex reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex reasoning tasks because training data lacks human inner thought processes (intentions and methodologies) that bridge reasoning steps.

Method: Proposes Thinking Before You Speak (TBYS) framework that automatically generates insights between reasoning steps, with a pipeline for collecting and filtering in-context examples without human labeling.

Result: Experiments on challenging mathematical datasets show TBYS effectively improves reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Proactively generating insights between reasoning steps addresses LLM reasoning deficiencies by mimicking human thought processes missing from training data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

*Chenxu Yang,Qingyi Si,Zheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDe framework dynamically integrates knowledge-grounded and non-grounded outputs using distribution divergence and confidence to balance faithfulness and expressiveness in LLM responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle to integrate external knowledge while maintaining both faithfulness (avoiding hallucinations) and natural expressiveness, resulting in outputs that are either unsupported or overly verbose.

Method: Collaborative Decoding (CoDe) - a plug-and-play approach that dynamically combines output probabilities from knowledge-grounded and non-grounded generation using distribution divergence and model confidence, with knowledge-aware reranking to prevent over-reliance on parametric knowledge.

Result: Superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: CoDe successfully breaks the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness in knowledge-grounded LLM responses through selective activation of reliable expressions and proper utilization of external information.

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while
ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through
comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates
superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising
expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its
effectiveness and generalizability.

### [19] [Emotion Omni: Enabling Empathetic Speech Response Generation through Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18655)
*Haoyu Wang,Guangyan Zhang,Jiale Chen,Jingyu Li,Yuehai Wang,Yiwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Emotion Omni, a speech LLM that understands emotional cues in user speech and generates empathetic responses without massive training data, using a novel 200k emotional dialogue dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech LLMs lack emotional understanding of user queries, missing paralinguistic cues that change meaning. Current empathetic models require massive datasets and computational resources.

Method: Developed Emotion Omni model architecture and a data generation pipeline using open-source TTS framework to create 200k emotional dialogue dataset for training empathetic speech assistants.

Result: Created a speech LLM capable of understanding emotional content in user speech and generating empathetic responses with limited data requirements compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Emotion Omni provides an effective solution for developing empathetic speech assistants without the need for large-scale training datasets, improving human-machine interaction through emotional understanding.

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture
designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate
empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation
pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional
dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech
assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/

*Xinglong Yang,Quan Feng,Zhongying Pan,Xiang Chen,Yu Tian,Wentong Li,Shuofei Qiao,Yuxia Geng,Xingyu Zhao,Sheng-Jun Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a framework for selecting multimodal chain-of-thought examples using model-perceived difficulty and intrinsic sample complexity to improve reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random or manual example selection in MCoT prompting fails to account for model-specific knowledge and task complexity, leading to suboptimal and unstable performance.

Method: Reframes prompt selection as curriculum design, integrating model-perceived difficulty (via prediction disagreement) and intrinsic sample complexity to create difficulty-balanced sampling strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmarks with multiple MLLMs show substantial improvements and reduced performance discrepancies from random sampling.

Conclusion: Provides a principled and robust approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning through difficulty-balanced prompt example selection.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often
limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples
fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the
intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

*Songtao Jiang,Yuxi Chen,Sibo Song,Yan Zhang,Yeying Jin,Yang Feng,Jian Wu,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Med-VLMs show fragility in medical VQA with answer inconsistencies across semantically equivalent question rephrasings. The paper introduces RoMed dataset and CCL method to improve robustness and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Medical Vision-Language Models exhibit concerning fragility in Medical Visual Question Answering, with answers fluctuating significantly when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions, which is critical for reliable diagnosis in high-stakes medical applications.

Method: Constructed RoMed dataset with 144k questions featuring word-level, sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. Proposed Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL) with two components: knowledge-anchored consistency learning to align with medical knowledge, and bias-aware contrastive learning to mitigate data-specific priors.

Result: Evaluation on SOTA models like LLaVA-Med showed alarming performance drops (e.g., 40% decline in Recall) on RoMed compared to original benchmarks. CCL achieved SOTA performance on three popular VQA benchmarks and improved answer consistency by 50% on RoMed test set.

Conclusion: CCL demonstrates significantly enhanced robustness for Medical Vision-Language Models, addressing critical fragility issues in medical question answering consistency through improved alignment with medical knowledge and mitigation of training data biases.

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

TL;DR: Attention2Probability is a lightweight attention-driven method that converts cross-attention weights into presence probabilities to improve domain-specific terminology recognition in speech-to-text systems, achieving high recall rates with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech large language models struggle with accurately generating domain-specific terms and neologisms, creating a need for robust terminology handling in speech-to-text systems.

Method: Proposes Attention2Probability which converts cross-attention weights between speech and terminology into presence probabilities, employs curriculum learning for enhanced retrieval accuracy, and creates a new speech dataset with terminology.

Result: Significantly outperforms VectorDB method with maximum recall rates of 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English, with only 8.71ms latency per query. Improves terminology accuracy by 6-17% in SLM tasks.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses terminology challenges in speech-to-text systems, demonstrating high performance and efficiency while revealing current limitations in SLMs' terminology utilization.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech
recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating
domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we
propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability
estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible,
and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between
speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs
curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create
and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in
this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly
outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum
recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall
is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs'
recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms
improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current
utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AOF prompting framework improves multilingual riddle generation by filtering redundant content and enforcing lexical novelty, achieving better diversity than standard prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard prompting strategies for multilingual riddle generation tend to reuse memorized content or perform shallow paraphrasing, lacking cultural fluency and creative abstraction.

Method: Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF) - a prompting framework that uses cosine-based similarity rejection to filter redundant generations while enforcing lexical novelty and cross-lingual fidelity.

Result: AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieved 0.177 Self-BLEU and 0.915 Distinct-2 in Japanese, showing improved lexical diversity and reduced redundancy across three LLMs and four language pairs.

Conclusion: Semantic rejection through AOF can guide culturally grounded, creative generation without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to
balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting
strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized
riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality
Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using
cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and
cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs,
AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915}
Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced
redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings
show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation
without task-specific fine-tuning.

TL;DR: EMMM is an explanation-first framework for detecting machine-generated text in customer service that provides interpretable explanations for non-expert users while maintaining competitive accuracy and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of LLMs in customer service creates risks of large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text. Current detection methods struggle in online conversational settings and lack interpretability for non-expert operators.

Method: EMMM uses an explanation-then-detection framework that first provides explanations and then performs detection, balancing latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.

Result: EMMM achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models, maintains low latency (outputs within 1 second), and 70% of human evaluators prefer its explanations for non-expert users.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the need for trustworthy, interpretable MGT detection in customer service scenarios with non-expert operators, providing accessible explanations while maintaining performance.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service
introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct
large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current
MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings,
reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI
deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically
non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In
this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that
balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.
Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to
non-expert users, with 70\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while
achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and
maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second. Our code and

Motivation: Current ad headline generation approaches focus on quality or CTR but overlook diversity, resulting in homogeneous outputs that fail to engage diverse audience segments.

Method: Proposes a semantic- and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline, followed by multi-stage multi-objective optimization with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to generate diverse, high-quality headlines in a single forward pass.

Result: Experiments on real-world industrial datasets show DIVER effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale platform serving hundreds of millions of users, it improves advertiser value by 4.0% and CTR by 1.4%.

Conclusion: DIVER successfully addresses the diversity-quality trade-off in ad headline generation and demonstrates significant real-world performance improvements in large-scale advertising platforms.

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of multimodal MECTEC datasets and limitations of existing methods that fail to explicitly model emotional/causal contexts and properly fuse semantic information across different levels.

Method: Proposes M3HG model that uses multimodal heterogeneous graph to explicitly capture emotional and causal contexts, fusing contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate M3HG's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Also introduces MECAD dataset with 989 conversations from 56 TV series covering diverse dialogue contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed M3HG model and MECAD dataset successfully address key challenges in multimodal emotion cause triplet extraction, providing better context modeling and performance than existing approaches.

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first
multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56
TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The

*Byeongjeong Kim,Jeonghyun Park,Joonho Yang,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChronoRAG is a novel RAG framework that addresses narrative QA challenges by structuring passages coherently and preserving temporal order, showing significant improvements on NarrativeQA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods struggle with narrative texts because they fail to capture the broader context and sequential relationships between segments, which are crucial for understanding narratives and answering questions that depend on event timelines.

Method: Proposes ChronoRAG framework with two key aspects: 1) refining dispersed document information into coherent structured passages, and 2) explicitly capturing and maintaining temporal order among retrieved passages to preserve narrative flow.

Result: Empirical evaluation on NarrativeQA dataset shows substantial improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships.

Conclusion: Reasoning over temporal order is crucial for resolving narrative question answering, and ChronoRAG effectively addresses the limitations of existing RAG approaches for narrative texts.

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

TL;DR: ThinkDial is the first open-source framework that enables GPT-4o-style controllable reasoning through discrete operational modes (High/Medium/Low) with significant token reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack computational effort control for practical deployment. Proprietary systems like GPT-4o have discrete reasoning modes, but open-source alternatives have failed to achieve similar capabilities.

Method: End-to-end training paradigm with budget-mode supervised fine-tuning and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with adaptive reward shaping to embed controllable reasoning capabilities.

Result: Achieves three operational modes: High (full capability), Medium (50% token reduction with <10% performance degradation), Low (75% token reduction with <15% performance degradation). Shows strong generalization on out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: ThinkDial successfully implements controllable reasoning with clear response length reductions while maintaining performance thresholds, providing the first open-source solution for GPT-4o-style operational modes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

TL;DR: A novel Rule-Based RL framework for grammatical error correction that outperforms traditional supervised fine-tuning approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved recall on Chinese datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional encoder-decoder models and current LLM approaches using supervised fine-tuning limit the model's reasoning capabilities in grammatical error correction tasks.

Method: Proposed a Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning framework to steer large language models for grammatical error correction, moving beyond direct supervised fine-tuning approaches.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on Chinese datasets with notable improvement in recall metrics compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The Rule-Based RL framework offers a more controllable and reliable paradigm for grammatical error correction, demonstrating the advantages of using reinforcement learning to guide LLMs in this domain.

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning
ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on
Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for
future development in GEC.

TL;DR: Introduces Theme Detection as a key task in conversational analytics, focusing on automatically identifying and categorizing conversation topics with controllable granularity through user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce manual effort in analyzing large-scale conversations (e.g., customer support/sales) and provide flexible, user-facing summaries of conversation core inquiries rather than fixed intent detection.

Method: Poses Controllable Conversational Theme Detection as a joint clustering and theme labeling problem with granularity control via user preference data, framed as a DSTC 12 competition track.

Result: Developed a public competition with associated dataset, evaluation metrics (automatic and human), and collected participant submissions with insights - all materials openly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: Theme Detection represents an advanced approach to conversational analytics that offers greater flexibility and user customization compared to traditional intent detection methods.

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track
materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

*Ziming Zhu,Chenglong Wang,Shunjie Xing,Yifu Huo,Fengning Tian,Quan Du,Di Yang,Chunliang Zhang,Tong Xiao,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaTeXTrans is a multi-agent system that outperforms mainstream MT systems in translating LaTeX documents while preserving format, structure, and terminology consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern MT systems struggle with LaTeX-formatted documents that interleave natural language with domain-specific syntax (equations, tables, figures, cross-references), requiring accurate preservation for semantic integrity and compilability.

Method: A collaborative multi-agent system with six specialized agents: Parser (decomposes LaTeX via placeholder substitution), Translator, Validator, Summarizer, Terminology Extractor (ensure context-aware, self-correcting translations), and Generator (reconstructs translated content).

Result: Experimental results show LaTeXTrans outperforms mainstream MT systems in both translation accuracy and structural fidelity.

Conclusion: LaTeXTrans provides an effective and practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents while maintaining format preservation and structural integrity.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel self-supervised framework combining semantic relations (AMR) and social propagation dynamics for misinformation detection, using LLM-based contrastive learning and multi-view graph autoencoder to achieve superior zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing misinformation detection methods that struggle with long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, social dynamics, and heavy reliance on labeled datasets.

Method: Integrates Abstract Meaning Representation for semantic relations and news propagation dynamics. Uses LLM-based graph contrastive loss with negative anchors for feature separability, and multi-view graph masked autoencoder for learning social context features.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, even with limited labeled datasets, while improving generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised framework effectively combines semantic and propagation features to detect misinformation in a zero-shot manner, overcoming resource-intensive labeling requirements and achieving strong performance.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,
even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods for creating mathematical training data face scalability, cost, and reliability challenges, limiting the quality of data available for enhancing LLM mathematical reasoning.

Method: A novel framework that integrates mathematical knowledge systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs, which are translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and validated through bilateral verification of solution correctness and program-problem consistency.

Conclusion: The program-assisted synthesis approach effectively addresses data quality challenges in mathematical reasoning training, producing scalable, diverse, and correct training data that substantially enhances LLM performance.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) demands
high-quality training data, yet conventional methods face critical challenges
in scalability, cost, and data reliability. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel program-assisted synthesis framework that systematically
generates a high-quality mathematical corpus with guaranteed diversity,
complexity, and correctness. This framework integrates mathematical knowledge
systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs
are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by
a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against
program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3
million such problem-solving triples. Experiments demonstrate that models
fine-tuned on our data significantly improve their inference capabilities,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and
showcasing the effectiveness of our synthesis approach.

*Yibo Li,Miao Xiong,Jiaying Wu,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConfTuner is a fine-tuning method that improves LLM confidence calibration using a tokenized Brier score loss function, enabling better uncertainty expression without needing ground-truth confidence scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate incorrect answers with high confidence (overconfidence), which is problematic in high-stakes domains like science, law, and healthcare where accurate uncertainty expression is crucial for reliability and trust.

Method: ConfTuner uses a novel tokenized Brier score loss function that acts as a proper scoring rule, theoretically incentivizing models to report true probabilities. It fine-tunes LLMs with minimal overhead and without requiring ground-truth confidence scores or proxy estimates.

Result: ConfTuner improves calibration across diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models like GPT-4o. Better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains in self-correction and model cascade.

Conclusion: ConfTuner advances trustworthy LLM systems by providing a simple, effective method for confidence calibration that works across different models and tasks, contributing to more reliable AI deployment in critical domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReflectivePrompt is an evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting method that uses reflective evolution with short-term and long-term reflection operations to optimize prompts for LLMs, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid advancement of prompt engineering and large language models, there is a growing need for automated methods to select optimized prompts. Current autoprompting approaches can be improved through more precise and comprehensive search techniques.

Conclusion: ReflectivePrompt establishes itself as one of the most effective solutions in evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting, showing substantial improvements in prompt optimization through its reflective evolution approach.

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement
of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel
autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective

TL;DR: Proposes LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA) method to help computing education researchers analyze large volumes of qualitative data more efficiently and rigorously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computing education researchers often lack resources to conduct generalizable, rigorous research at scale. There's a need for methods that enable sense-making with large qualitative data without increasing researcher burden.

Method: A variation of LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA) that combines traditional content analysis with large language models to analyze large volumes of textual data.

Result: Demonstrated how LACA can be applied to computing education datasets in a reproducible and rigorous manner, enabling larger-scale research.

Conclusion: LACA has significant potential in CER to produce more generalizable findings and advance both teaching practice and research quality in the discipline.

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

TL;DR: Automated analysis of parliamentary speeches in six European countries reveals consistent affective polarization patterns, with parliamentarians showing more negativity towards opposing groups than their own, driven by reciprocity mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the presence and patterns of affective polarization in European parliaments using automated natural language processing techniques on parliamentary speeches.

Method: Utilized comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from six European countries, employed NLP techniques to estimate parliamentarian sentiment, compared negativity levels in references to opposing groups vs own groups.

Result: Found consistent affective polarization across all six European parliaments. Activity correlates with negativity but no difference in polarization between less and more active MPs. Reciprocity identified as contributing mechanism.

Conclusion: Affective polarization is a consistent feature across European parliaments, driven by reciprocal negative interactions between opposing political groups.

Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility
towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse
worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians
across all six parliaments.

*Ilias Driouich,Hongliu Cao,Eoin Thomas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework for generating synthetic QA datasets that improves RAG evaluation by prioritizing semantic diversity and privacy preservation through clustering-based diversity enhancement and sensitive information masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG evaluation focuses mainly on performance metrics while neglecting dataset quality, particularly regarding semantic diversity and privacy protection of sensitive information in real-world applications.

Method: Three-agent framework: (1) Diversity agent uses clustering for topical coverage and semantic variability, (2) Privacy Agent detects and masks sensitive information across domains, (3) QA curation agent synthesizes private and diverse QA pairs as ground truth.

Result: The evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets, demonstrating superior performance in both diversity and privacy protection.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and ethically aligned approach for safer, more comprehensive RAG system evaluation, establishing foundation for future enhancements aligned with AI regulations and compliance standards.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE
emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to

TL;DR: HiPlan is a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive global-local guidance to enhance LLM-based agents' decision-making in complex tasks by decomposing them into milestones and step-wise hints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents struggle with complex, long-horizon planning due to lack of macroscopic guidance and insufficient continuous oversight during execution, leading to disorientation and failures in complex tasks.

Method: HiPlan uses a hierarchical approach with offline milestone library construction from expert demonstrations and online dynamic adaptation of trajectory segments to generate step-wise hints that align current observations with milestone objectives.

Result: Extensive experiments across two challenging benchmarks show HiPlan substantially outperforms strong baselines, with ablation studies validating the complementary benefits of its hierarchical components.

Conclusion: HiPlan effectively addresses LLM agents' planning limitations through hierarchical guidance, demonstrating significant performance improvements in complex decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary
benefits of its hierarchical components.

TL;DR: First study of physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues using SOAP framework taxonomy, with large-scale annotation and benchmarking of medical intent classification models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how physicians guide medical conversations through targeted questioning and intent trajectories to improve diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: Developed fine-grained physician intent taxonomy based on SOAP framework, conducted large-scale annotation of 5000+ doctor-patient turns with medical experts, benchmarked state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for intent classification.

Result: Models understand general medical dialogue structure with high accuracy but struggle with SOAP category transitions; identified common medical dialogue trajectories; intent filtering significantly boosts medical dialogue summarization performance.

Conclusion: Provides valuable insights for differential diagnosis system design and demonstrates the importance of intent understanding in medical dialogue processing, with publicly available dataset and annotation guidelines.

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to
diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these
conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at

### [44] [It's All About In-Context Learning! Teaching Extremely Low-Resource Languages to LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19089)
*Yue Li,Zhixue Zhao,Carolina Scarton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with extremely low-resource languages and rare scripts due to data scarcity. This paper shows zero-shot in-context learning with language alignment works best for these languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is better for moderately represented languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extremely low-resource languages, particularly those with rare scripts, remain largely unsupported by large language models due to lack of training data, creating a need to understand how LLMs can acquire such languages through different learning methods.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can acquire extremely low-resource languages via in-context learning (with/without auxiliary alignment signals) compared to parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Systematic evaluation of 20 under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.

Result: PEFT has limitations when both language and script are extremely under-represented. Zero-shot ICL with language alignment is highly effective for extremely low-resource languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT works better for languages relatively better represented by LLMs.

Conclusion: For extremely low-resource languages, practitioners should use zero-shot ICL with language alignment and avoid fine-tuning multilingual models on languages with unseen scripts. Different adaptation strategies are needed based on language representation levels.

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

*Mathew Henrickson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAG framework for art provenance research that enables natural-language multilingual searches in fragmented archival data, reducing dependency on precise metadata requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provenance research is essential for art authentication and historical context but is hindered by fragmented multilingual archival data and current search systems that require precise metadata, limiting exploratory capabilities.

Method: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework using semantic retrieval and contextual summarization to enable natural-language and multilingual searches on auction records from the Getty Provenance Index.

Result: The approach successfully retrieved and summarized auction records from a 10,000-record sample of Getty Provenance Index - German Sales, demonstrating scalable navigation of art market archives.

Conclusion: This RAG framework provides a practical and scalable tool for historians and cultural heritage professionals to conduct historically sensitive research in art provenance studies.

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for
art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance
research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for
verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and
understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process
is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient
retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting
exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual
searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing
dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and
summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty
Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a
scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool
for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically
sensitive research.

*Thomas Compton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A transparent hybrid framework for quantitative discourse analysis combining lexical and semantic methods using Python tools (NLTK, spaCy, Sentence Transformers) with BERTopic modeling for improved reproducibility and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of black-box QDA software (MAXQDA, NVivo) by creating a transparent, customizable framework that ensures methodological transparency and alignment with research goals in computational discourse analysis.

Method: Hybrid approach combining lexical searches with semantic clustering using Python pipelines (NLTK, spaCy, Sentence Transformers) and iterative BERTopic modeling with UMAP dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction.

Result: Demonstrated through historical political discourse case study, showing fine-grained control over preprocessing and embedding generation, with optimized topic coherence and coverage through parameter tuning.

Conclusion: Multi-layered approach combining lexical and semantic methods mitigates limitations of isolated methods, emphasizing code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological triangulation for computational discourse studies.

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of
Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box
software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency
and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent
framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable
triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study
in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines
using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over
preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our
iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary

### [47] [Do LVLMs Know What They Know? A Systematic Study of Knowledge Boundary Perception in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19111)
*Zhikai Ding,Shiyu Ni,Keping Bi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LVLMs have reasonable knowledge boundary perception but need improvement. Probabilistic and consistency-based confidence signals are reliable, while verbalized confidence causes overconfidence. Calibration methods from LLMs can enhance LVLMs' perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well large vision-language models perceive their knowledge boundaries and understand what they know vs. what they don't know, as reliable models should have this self-awareness to avoid hallucination.

Method: Evaluated three confidence signals (probabilistic, consistency-based, verbalized) across three LVLMs and three VQA datasets. Adapted confidence calibration methods from LLMs and proposed three new methods to enhance perception.

Result: LVLMs show reasonable knowledge boundary perception but substantial room for improvement. Probabilistic and consistency-based signals are reliable indicators, while verbalized confidence leads to overconfidence. Joint visual-text processing reduces performance but improves perception compared to LLMs.

Conclusion: LVLMs need better knowledge boundary perception. Effective calibration methods can enhance their self-awareness, and visual processing helps reduce overconfidence despite slightly lower performance.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

*Alan Li,Yixin Liu,Arpan Sarkar,Doug Downey,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciReas and SciReas-Pro benchmarks for scientific reasoning evaluation, and KRUX framework to analyze knowledge vs reasoning roles. Key findings show knowledge retrieval is a bottleneck, external knowledge helps reasoning, and better reasoning surfaces more relevant knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no widely adopted holistic benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning in LLMs, and few approaches systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in scientific problem solving.

Method: Introduced SciReas (suite of scientific reasoning benchmarks) and SciReas-Pro (subset requiring complex reasoning). Proposed KRUX framework to study reasoning vs knowledge roles. Conducted holistic evaluation and in-depth analysis.

Result: Key findings: (1) Knowledge retrieval from model parameters is a critical bottleneck; (2) Reasoning models benefit from external knowledge; (3) Enhanced reasoning improves knowledge surfacing. Also released SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline.

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive benchmarks and analysis framework for scientific reasoning, revealing important insights about knowledge-reasoning interplay and offering a strong baseline for future research.

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning
improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct
a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with
concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline
for scientific reasoning.

TL;DR: VibeVoice is a novel speech synthesis model that uses next-token diffusion to generate long-form multi-speaker conversations with up to 90 minutes of speech in a 64K context window, achieving superior performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of synthesizing authentic long-form conversational speech with multiple speakers while maintaining high audio fidelity and computational efficiency.

Method: Employs next-token diffusion for autoregressive latent vector generation and introduces a novel continuous speech tokenizer that improves data compression by 80x compared to Encodec while preserving audio quality.

Result: The model can synthesize speech for up to 90 minutes with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing authentic conversational dynamics and outperforming both open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

Conclusion: VibeVoice demonstrates that next-token diffusion with an efficient continuous tokenizer enables high-quality long-form multi-speaker speech synthesis with significant computational advantages.

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

### [50] [Evaluating the Evaluators: Are readability metrics good measures of readability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19221)
*Isabel Cachola,Daniel Khashabi,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Traditional readability metrics like Flesch-Kincaid perform poorly for plain language summarization evaluation. Language models show better correlation with human judgments and capture deeper readability aspects like background knowledge requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PLS evaluation relies on traditional readability metrics that haven't been validated against human judgments in this specific domain, despite their proven utility in other fields.

Method: Conducted thorough survey of PLS literature, evaluated 8 traditional readability metrics against human judgments, tested language models as readability judges, and extended analysis to PLS datasets.

Result: Most traditional metrics correlate poorly with human judgments (including FKGL). Language models perform better with best model achieving Pearson correlation of 0.56. LMs better capture deeper readability measures like background knowledge and lead to different conclusions than traditional metrics.

Conclusion: Language models are superior to traditional readability metrics for PLS evaluation. Recommendations provided for best practices in plain language summary evaluation, with analysis code and survey data released.

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

### [51] [Generative Interfaces for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19227)
*Jiaqi Chen,Yanzhe Zhang,Yutong Zhang,Yijia Shao,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs generate interactive UIs instead of text responses to improve multi-turn, information-dense tasks, outperforming traditional chat interfaces in 70% of user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional linear request-response LLM interfaces are inefficient for complex, exploratory tasks that require multi-turn interactions and dense information exchange.

Method: Proposes Generative Interfaces framework using structured interface-specific representations and iterative refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs.

Result: Generative interfaces consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in over 70% of cases across diverse tasks and interaction patterns.

Conclusion: Generative UI approach significantly enhances human-AI interaction for complex tasks, providing clear advantages over traditional chat-based interfaces and paving way for future advancements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

### [52] [Towards Training-Free Underwater 3D Object Detection from Sonar Point Clouds: A Comparison of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18293)
*M. Salman Shaukat,Yannik Käckenmeister,Sebastian Bader,Thomas Kirste*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents two training-free approaches for underwater 3D object detection using sonar data: a neural network trained on synthetic data and a model-based template matching system. The template matching approach outperforms neural networks on real data despite requiring no training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater 3D object detection faces challenges due to expensive and scarce annotated sonar data collection. The research aims to achieve reliable detection without real-world training data.

Method: Developed two paradigms: 1) physics-based sonar simulation pipeline generating synthetic data for neural networks, and 2) model-based template matching system leveraging geometric priors of target objects.

Result: Neural networks achieved 98% mAP on simulated scenes but dropped to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift. Template matching maintained 83% mAP on real data without training, showing robustness to noise and environmental variations.

Conclusion: Template matching outperforms data-hungry deep learning approaches in underwater domains, challenging conventional wisdom and establishing the first large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection.

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobileDenseAttn is a dual-stream fusion model combining MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 for brain tumor detection in MRI, achieving 98.35% accuracy with improved efficiency and interpretability through GradCAM visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual brain tumor analysis in MRI is time-consuming and error-prone. Current automated approaches lack generalization, computational efficiency, interpretability, and transparency, limiting their trustworthiness in clinical settings.

Method: Feature-level fusion of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 streams trained on augmented dataset of 6,020 MRI scans (glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, normal). Uses 5-fold cross-validation and GradCAM for visual explanations.

Result: 99.75% training accuracy, 98.35% testing accuracy, F1 score of 0.9835. Outperforms baseline models with +3.67% accuracy increase and 39.3% training time reduction compared to VGG19. GradCAM provides clear tumor localization.

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn is an efficient, high-performance, interpretable model with strong potential for clinical application in real-world brain tumor identification due to its accuracy, speed, and transparent decision-making.

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [54] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle to link visual representations with factual knowledge, showing systematic grounding deficiencies that can be detected with high accuracy using internal state probes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify systematic deficiencies in multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models and understand why they perform worse with visual references compared to textual references.

Method: Conducted controlled studies comparing VLM performance with textual vs visual references, analyzed internal state patterns, and developed probes to detect linking failures without retraining.

Result: VLMs' factual recall ability halves when using image representations vs textual references. Probes on internal states achieved 92% accuracy in flagging unreliable responses, enabling 7.87% coverage increase and 0.9% error reduction in selective prediction.

Conclusion: VLMs have systematic, detectable deficiencies in linking visual representations with internal knowledge, and addressing this grounding issue is crucial for improving multimodal understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

TL;DR: Semantic-aware neural reconstruction method that improves 3D model quality from sparse images by incorporating patch-based semantic logits and geometric regularization to reduce ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of severe radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse image inputs for 3D reconstruction.

Method: Enriches neural implicit representations with patch-based semantic logits optimized alongside signed distance field and radiance field, plus novel regularization using geometric primitive masks to mitigate shape ambiguity.

Result: Achieves 44% reduction in average chamfer distance for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon on DTU dataset. As plugin for dense reconstruction baselines (NeuS, Neuralangelo), reduces average error by 69% and 68% respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic-aware approach significantly improves 3D reconstruction quality from sparse images by effectively addressing feature mismatch and shape ambiguity issues.

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning approach using lightweight models and ensemble techniques achieves 92.33% accuracy in detecting illegal landfills from aerial imagery using the AerialWaste Dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illegal landfills pose hazardous threats worldwide but are difficult to detect manually. There's a lack of good quality public datasets due to security concerns, making automated detection crucial for saving time and resources.

Method: Used lightweight deep learning models (Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet, MobileVit) to avoid overfitting, then combined best performers into an ensemble model using fusion techniques for binary classification.

Result: Achieved 92.33% accuracy, 92.67% precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score, and 92.71% specificity in illegal landfill detection using ensemble approach.

Conclusion: Lightweight models with ensemble techniques are effective for illegal landfill detection, overcoming overfitting issues while maintaining high performance on the AerialWaste Dataset.

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSU is a novel multimodal sentiment analysis framework that integrates modality-specific structural information and cross-modal semantic grounding to address limitations in existing fusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods neglect modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting quality, interpretability, and robustness in sentiment analysis.

Method: SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs using linguistic syntax for text and text-guided attention for acoustic/visual modalities. It introduces a semantic anchor from global textual semantics for cross-modal alignment and uses multiview contrastive learning for discriminability and consistency.

Result: SSU achieves state-of-the-art performance on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI benchmarks while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates superior interpretability and ability to capture nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions, offering an effective solution for multimodal sentiment analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar is a pose-invariant feed-forward framework that generates 3D Gaussian Splatting models from single face images in under 10ms, achieving superior reconstruction quality and 1000x speedup over optimization-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D face avatar generation either require slow per-face optimization or suffer from poor reconstruction quality in feed-forward approaches. There's a need for fast, high-quality 3D face generation that works from arbitrary poses.

Method: Uses encoder-decoder network to encode input face into identity-specific latent embedding, then decodes to predict residuals to structural/appearance parameters of a pre-built 3DGS template model. Only infers residuals for fast feed-forward inference.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing feed-forward methods in reconstruction quality, runs 1000x faster than optimization methods (<10ms inference), and supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing.

Conclusion: FastAvatar combines excellent reconstruction quality with unprecedented speed, expanding the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in consumer and interactive systems.

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

*Giuseppe Stragapede,Sam Merrick,Vedrana Krivokuća Hahn,Justin Sukaitis,Vincent Graf Narbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A mobile biometric system with PolyProtect BTP scheme for humanitarian scenarios, evaluated on face and fingerprint data showing promising security and privacy protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometrics improve efficiency in humanitarian operations but pose risks to vulnerable populations, requiring secure template protection.

Method: Developed mobile biometric system with PolyProtect BTP on neural network face embeddings, evaluated verification/identification accuracy, irreversibility, and unlinkability using EdgeFace feature extractor on real-world Ethiopian dataset.

Result: Promising experimental results showing PolyProtect's effectiveness for both face and fingerprint biometrics in identification scenarios.

Conclusion: PolyProtect is suitable for humanitarian contexts due to effectiveness, modularity, and lightweight computation, with plans to release code.

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [60] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models need explicit relational reasoning capabilities through dynamic graph interfaces to handle tasks requiring entity, role, and spatio-temporal relationship understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision foundation models lack explicit reasoning capabilities for relational tasks like fine-grained activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and medical image analysis where spatial, temporal, and semantic dependencies are crucial.

Method: Augmenting foundation models with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules that create dynamic relational graphs whose topology and edge semantics are inferred from input and task context.

Result: Hybrid models with graph reasoning modules show improved fine-grained semantic fidelity, out-of-distribution robustness, interpretability, computational efficiency, and favorable memory/hardware efficiency compared to FM-only baselines.

Conclusion: Next-generation foundation models should incorporate explicit relational interfaces through dynamic graph reasoning, with future research focusing on learned graph construction, multi-level reasoning, cross-modal fusion, and better evaluation protocols for relational competence.

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

### [61] [LPLC: A Dataset for License Plate Legibility Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18425)
*Lucas Wojcik,Gabriel E. Lima,Valfride Nascimento,Eduil Nascimento Jr.,Rayson Laroca,David Menotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset (LPLC) with 10,210 vehicle images and 12,687 annotated license plates for legibility classification, addressing the challenge of recognizing illegible license plates in ALPR systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic License Plate Recognition struggles with illegible license plates, and existing super-resolution methods don't fully solve the core recognition problem. There's a need for selective image pre-processing to optimize computational efficiency.

Method: Created a novel dataset with fine-grained annotations including vehicle/LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories, and character labels. Proposed a classification benchmark using ViT, ResNet, and YOLO networks to categorize LP images into three conditions: good enough, needs super-resolution, or unrecoverable.

Result: All three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, YOLO) achieved F1 scores below 80%, demonstrating the difficulty of the task. The analysis of SR and LP recognition methods confirmed the challenges in handling illegible license plates.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a valuable resource for research, and the poor performance of baseline models highlights the need for further development in license plate legibility classification methods.

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at

*Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Ismam Nur Swapnil,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLARIFY is a Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological VQA that combines a lightweight domain-trained image classifier with a compressed conversational VLM, achieving 18% higher diagnostic accuracy and 20% lower VRAM usage than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models have limitations in specialized medical diagnostic accuracy and high inference costs, making them impractical for real-world clinical deployment.

Method: Combines a specialist image classifier for fast diagnostic predictions with a compressed generalist VLM for explanations, guided by specialist predictions and enhanced with knowledge graph-based retrieval for factual grounding.

Result: 18% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over best baseline, with 20% reduction in VRAM requirement and 5% reduction in latency on multimodal dermatology dataset.

Conclusion: Specialist-Generalist systems provide a practical paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI systems in medical domains.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

*Md. Rashid Shahriar Khan,Md. Abrar Hasan,Mohammod Tareq Aziz Justice*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot anomaly detection framework combining TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP for surveillance footage, using temporal forecasting and semantic context without anomaly training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting anomalies in surveillance is challenging due to unpredictable nature and context-dependence. Need for methods that can identify abnormal events without prior exposure to anomalies.

Method: Hybrid architecture with TimeSformer (spatiotemporal features), DPC (future representation forecasting), and CLIP (semantic context via text prompts). Joint training with InfoNCE and CPC losses, plus context-gating mechanism for scene-aware predictions.

Result: Framework enables detection of previously unseen behaviors by integrating temporal reasoning with vision-language understanding in complex surveillance environments.

Conclusion: Successfully bridges gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context for zero-shot anomaly detection, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow is a self-supervised framework that uses 4D radar Doppler measurements to generate motion pseudo-labels for LiDAR scene flow estimation, eliminating the need for manual annotations while achieving near-supervised performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating large-scale manually annotated datasets for 3D scene flow estimation is a major bottleneck for autonomous systems. Current self-supervised methods underperform in challenging scenarios, while supervised methods are not scalable due to expensive human labeling requirements.

Method: Cross-modal label transfer approach where DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time from 4D radar Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware association and ambiguity-resolved propagation.

Result: On the MAN TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow outperforms existing self-supervised methods and enables LiDAR backbones to achieve over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of ground truth data.

Conclusion: DoGFlow provides an effective self-supervised solution for 3D scene flow estimation that eliminates dependency on manual annotations while maintaining high performance, making it scalable for real-world autonomous navigation applications.

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SatSkylines is a 3D building generation method that uses satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors to create detailed building structures, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle with accurate building reconstruction from satellite views alone, while detailization methods require highly detailed inputs and fail with simple priors like cuboids.

Method: Models the transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries, enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. Uses a large-scale dataset (Skylines-50K) of over 50,000 stylized 3D building assets.

Result: The approach effectively generates detailed building models from satellite imagery and coarse geometric guidance, demonstrating strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: SatSkylines provides an effective solution for 3D building generation that bridges the gap between satellite imagery and detailed geometric reconstruction, offering both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage deep learning pipeline for detecting Spatial Transition Points (STPs) and identifying the Main STP in 3D game environments from single frames, with adapter-based transfer learning showing robustness in low-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Players need visual affordances to identify map transition points in complex 3D games. Efficient detection is crucial for auto-mapping and evaluating map cue presentation, providing an objective basis for navigation aids and level-design tools.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Faster R-CNN for STP detection, 2) lightweight MSTP selector fusing local and global visual features with parameter-efficient adapters. Optional retrieval-augmented fusion step. Validated on custom dataset from five Action RPG titles.

Result: Full-network fine-tuning achieves superior STP detection with sufficient data, but adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and effective in low-data scenarios and for MSTP selection task. Baseline performance metrics established.

Conclusion: The work successfully formalizes the STP detection problem, provides a baseline pipeline and dataset, and demonstrates the effectiveness of adapter-based transfer learning, contributing to future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Motivation: Current SOTA audio-driven animation methods work well for speech and singing but fail to meet the demands of complex film/TV productions requiring nuanced interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work.

Method: Proposed Wan-S2V model built upon Wan framework, designed specifically for film-level character animation with enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in cinematic contexts.

Result: Extensive experiments show Wan-S2V significantly outperforms cutting-edge models like Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. Also demonstrates versatility in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing applications.

Conclusion: Wan-S2V successfully addresses the long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation through audio-driven approaches, offering superior performance and expanded capabilities compared to existing solutions.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

TL;DR: Proposes DeReF framework with random feature reorganization between decoupling and MoE fusion to address limitations in cancer survival analysis multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods for cancer survival analysis have fixed fusion schemes that limit dynamic feature combinations and MoE-based methods suffer from information isolation between expert networks.

Method: Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion (DeReF) framework with random feature reorganization strategy between modality decoupling and dynamic MoE fusion modules, plus regional cross-attention network for better feature representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on Liver Cancer dataset and three TCGA public datasets confirm the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: DeReF successfully addresses limitations of existing fusion methods by enabling dynamic feature combinations and better information interaction among decoupled features.

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ROSE is a framework for removing objects along with their side effects (shadows, reflections, light, translucency, mirror effects) from videos using synthetic data generation and diffusion transformer-based inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video object removal methods struggle with eliminating side effects like shadows and reflections due to scarcity of paired video data for supervision.

Method: Uses 3D rendering engine for synthetic data generation, constructs automatic pipeline for paired dataset creation, implements diffusion transformer-based inpainting model with reference-based erasing and additional supervision for affected areas.

Result: ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses object side effect removal through synthetic data generation and comprehensive modeling, demonstrating strong performance on the new ROSE-Bench benchmark.

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

TL;DR: OwlCap is a video captioning MLLM that addresses motion-detail imbalance through a new HMD-270K dataset and CSER optimization, achieving significant improvements on both detail-focused and motion-focused benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning methods suffer from motion-detail imbalance, where models overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the other, resulting in incomplete captions and inconsistent video understanding/generation.

Method: Two-pronged approach: 1) Data: Constructed HMD-270K dataset via Motion-Detail Fusion and Fine-Grained Examination pipeline; 2) Optimization: Developed Caption Set Equivalence Reward based on Group Relative Policy Optimization for bidirectional validation.

Result: OwlCap achieves significant improvements: +4.2 Acc on detail-focused VDC benchmark and +4.6 F1 on motion-focused DREAM-1K benchmark compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed HMD-270K dataset and CSER optimization effectively address motion-detail imbalance in video captioning, with OwlCap demonstrating balanced performance across both motion and detail aspects. The resources will be publicly released to advance video captioning research.

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of Oracle Bone Inscriptions from rubbing images is challenging due to noise and cracks that limit conventional detection networks' effectiveness.

Method: Uses Oracle Bones Character font library as prior knowledge for clustering-based representation learning, incorporates specialized loss function from clustering results into total network loss.

Result: Significant performance improvements demonstrated across three mainstream detection frameworks (Faster R-CNN, DETR, Sparse R-CNN) on two OBIs detection datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed clustering-based feature representation learning method effectively enhances Oracle Bone Inscriptions detection performance despite degradation challenges.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

*Xin Tian,Yingtie Lei,Xiujun Zhang,Zimeng Li,Chi-Man Pun,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFormer uses frequency domain SNR priors and transformer architecture to enhance underwater images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 3.1 dB PSNR improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial domain SNR priors fail to effectively separate cross-channel interference and provide limited noise suppression while amplifying informative structures in underwater image enhancement.

Method: Proposes Fourier Attention SNR-prior Transformer (FAST) that uses frequency domain SNR priors to decompose features into amplitude and phase spectra for better channel modulation, combined with Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT) bottleneck that merges low- and high-frequency branches using gated attention mechanism in a U-shaped architecture.

Result: Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB, EUVP, and LSUI datasets, SFormer achieves 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and 0.08 improvement in SSIM compared to recent methods, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in underwater scenes.

Conclusion: Frequency domain SNR priors combined with transformer architecture provide superior underwater image enhancement by effectively handling cross-channel interference and enhancing perceptual quality through spectral decomposition and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

*Dongfang Wang,Jian Yang,Yizhe Zhang,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network (HSSN) for echocardiography video segmentation to improve Ejection Fraction estimation accuracy by combining local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing echocardiography segmentation methods achieve good segmentation performance but perform poorly in EF estimation due to limitations in handling both local details and global temporal dynamics.

Method: Hierarchical network design with low-level stages using CNNs for single-frame detail preservation and high-level stages using Mamba architecture for spatio-temporal relationship capture. Introduces Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module for long-range context integration across frames and positions.

Result: The proposed approach addresses limitations of single-frame (local error accumulation) and multi-frame (detail neglect) methods, mitigating EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise.

Conclusion: The hierarchical spatio-temporal segmentation network effectively balances detail preservation and dynamic perception, improving EF estimation accuracy in echocardiography video analysis.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

*Zhitong Cheng,Yiran Jiang,Yulong Ge,Yufeng Li,Zhongheng Qin,Rongzhi Lin,Jianwei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPS is a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision boundaries while keeping feature encoders frozen, leveraging geometric patterns in pre-trained models to address domain shift efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UDA methods rely on fine-tuning feature extractors, which is inefficient, reduces interpretability, and scales poorly with modern architectures. Domain shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature degradation.

Method: Feature-space Planes Searcher (FPS) optimizes decision boundaries by leveraging domain-invariant geometric patterns (intra-class clustering and inter-class separation) in pre-trained models while keeping the feature encoder frozen.

Result: FPS achieves competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks, scales efficiently with multimodal large models, and shows versatility across diverse domains including protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake detection.

Conclusion: FPS provides a simple, effective, and generalizable paradigm for transfer learning that reduces memory and computational costs through offline feature extraction while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning framework combining customized InceptionV3, LSTM, and ensemble feature selection achieves 99.65% accuracy for human activity recognition with minimal features and real-time deployment capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human Activity Recognition systems face challenges with high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability in real-time scenarios, requiring optimized solutions for practical deployment.

Method: Integrates customized InceptionV3 for spatial feature extraction, LSTM for temporal dependency modeling, and an ensemble-based genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA) for feature selection.

Result: Achieves 99.65% recognition accuracy on UCF-YouTube dataset, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time for real-time deployment on edge devices like Raspberry Pi.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight and scalable framework enables accurate, robust HAR in heterogeneous environments with practical applications in public safety, assistive technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with capturing subtle color variations and modeling global deformations in endoscopic videos, limiting high-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues.

Method: Proposes Colored Gaussian Primitives with dynamic anchors for adaptive color encoding, and Enhanced Deformation Model combining time-aware basis functions with learnable time-independent deformations.

Result: Achieves PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior 3DGS methods) and 97.25% SSIM on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and benchmark datasets, while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency.

Conclusion: ColorGS advances surgical scene reconstruction by balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, making it suitable for intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yuta Naito,Kohei Fukuda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Class-wise flooding regularization improves minority class performance in imbalanced datasets by applying class-specific flooding levels based on frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks trained on imbalanced datasets tend to favor majority classes, degrading minority class recognition performance.

Method: Extension of flooding regularization applied at class level with class-specific flooding levels based on class frequencies to suppress overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning for minority classes.

Result: Improves classification performance of minority classes and achieves better overall generalization compared to conventional flooding regularizations in imbalanced image classification.

Conclusion: Class-wise flooding regularization effectively addresses class imbalance by preventing overfitting in majority classes while enabling proper learning of minority classes.

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yoshikazu Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM) to combine Curriculum Learning with Sharpness-Aware Minimization, overcoming the challenge of evaluating sample difficulty in flat minima regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks suffer from overfitting and poor generalization. While Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this by selecting samples based on difficulty, and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves robustness through flat minima, combining them is challenging because flat regions make difficulty assessment ineffective.

Method: Develops Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM) that quantifies adversarial vulnerability by measuring normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. Incorporates ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample difficulty.

Result: Evaluated on image classification, fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization tasks. Outperforms existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies while preserving strengths of both CL and SAM.

Conclusion: ADM effectively bridges the gap between Curriculum Learning and flat minima optimization, maintaining informative difficulty assessment throughout training and achieving superior generalization performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

*Melanie Wille,Tobias Fischer,Scarlett Raine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of underwater object detection challenges reveals that scallop class under-performance is primarily due to foreground-background discrimination issues in localization, not just data quantity. Classification shows persistent precision gaps even with balanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific performance disparities in underwater object detection, particularly for marine species like scallops, and to systematically improve detection of under-performing classes.

Method: Manipulated DUO dataset to separate object detection into localization and classification tasks. Used YOLO11 and TIDE for localization analysis, conducted classification experiments with balanced and imbalanced data distributions to investigate scallop class performance.

Result: Localization analysis found foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments revealed persistent precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based challenges beyond data scarcity.

Conclusion: Recommend imbalanced distributions for precision prioritization and balanced distributions for recall prioritization. Improving under-performing classes requires algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules. Code and datasets are publicly released.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

TL;DR: Drawing2CAD is a framework that converts 2D engineering drawings into parametric CAD models using sequence-to-sequence learning, preserving geometric precision and design intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAD generative methods diverge from industrial workflows that start with 2D drawings, and automatic generation from vector drawings remains underexplored despite being critical for engineering design.

Method: A dual-decoder transformer architecture with network-friendly vector primitive representation, decoupling command type and parameter generation while maintaining correspondence, using soft target distribution loss for CAD parameter flexibility.

Result: The method was trained and evaluated on CAD-VGDrawing dataset, demonstrating effectiveness in converting engineering drawings to parametric CAD models.

Conclusion: Drawing2CAD successfully bridges the gap between 2D engineering drawings and parametric CAD generation, providing a framework that aligns with traditional industrial workflows while maintaining geometric precision.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Motivation: Existing AVSR systems struggle with estimating audio reliability and dynamically adjusting modality reliance in noisy environments, leading to poor performance.

Method: Proposes router-gated cross-modal feature fusion using an audio-visual feature fusion-based router to down-weight unreliable audio tokens and reinforce visual cues through gated cross-attention in decoder layers.

Result: Achieves 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to AV-HuBERT on LRS3 dataset, with ablation studies confirming both router and gating mechanism contribute to improved robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables adaptive modality reweighting based on acoustic corruption, allowing the model to pivot toward visual modality when audio quality deteriorates, significantly improving robustness in noisy environments.

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

*Qinqian Lei,Bo Wang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New benchmark reformulates HOI detection as multiple-choice task to fairly evaluate both VLMs and specialized methods, avoiding penalization of valid predictions in ambiguous cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI benchmarks use exact class matching that penalizes VLMs and HOI methods for equally plausible interpretations in ambiguous human-object interaction scenarios.

Method: Introduces new evaluation protocol as multiple-answer multiple-choice task with only ground-truth positives and curated negatives that reduce ambiguity.

Result: Enables direct comparison between general-purpose VLMs and specialized HOI methods, providing fair assessment of HOI understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark addresses limitations of existing protocols and offers new insights into HOI detection progress for both VLMs and specialized approaches.

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research focused on textual MCQ options but overlooked visual options, and manual distractor generation is costly and not scalable for high-quality educational content.

Method: Cross-modal Options Synthesis (CmOS) framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought reasoning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to produce semantically plausible visual options, plus a discrimination module to identify suitable visual content.

Result: Experimental results show CmOS outperforms existing methods in content discrimination, question generation, and visual option generation across various subjects and educational levels.

Conclusion: The proposed CmOS framework effectively addresses the challenge of generating high-quality visual options for educational MCQs, demonstrating superior performance over previous approaches.

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

*Christian Löwens,Thorben Funke,Jingchao Xie,Alexandru Paul Condurache*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PseudoMapTrainer enables online mapping without ground-truth HD maps by using pseudo-labels from unlabeled sensor data via Gaussian splatting and 2D segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online mapping models require expensive ground-truth HD maps for training, which are geographically limited and hinder generalization.

Method: Generates pseudo-labels by reconstructing road surfaces from multi-camera imagery using Gaussian splatting and pre-trained 2D segmentation, with mask-aware assignment and loss for handling partial masks.

Result: Enables training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps and allows semi-supervised pre-training using large-scale unlabeled crowdsourced data.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel approach that eliminates dependency on expensive ground-truth maps while maintaining mapping performance through pseudo-label generation.

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Conclusion: The work establishes rigorous baselines, introduces robust pseudo-labeling pipeline, generates high-quality annotations, and systematically evaluates OVOD models for real-world waste sorting applications.

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

### [88] [Embedding Font Impression Word Tags Based on Co-occurrence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18825)
*Yugo Kubota,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel graph-based embedding method for font impression tags that outperforms standard word embeddings like BERT/CLIP in font generation and retrieval tasks by leveraging font shape-impression relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different font styles convey distinct impressions, and there's a close relationship between font shapes and impression tags. Standard word embedding methods fail to capture these shape-impression relationships effectively for font-related tasks.

Method: Construct a graph with impression tags as nodes and co-occurrence relationships as edges, then apply spectral embedding to obtain impression vectors that capture the shape-impression relationships.

Result: The proposed method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur, unlike BERT and CLIP which yield very different vectors. It performs better in qualitative and quantitative evaluations for impression-guided font generation.

Conclusion: The graph-based spectral embedding approach is particularly useful for impression-based font generation and retrieval, demonstrating superior performance compared to standard word embedding methods.

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

*Takayuki Ishikawa,Carmelo Bonannella,Bas J. W. Lerink,Marc Rußwurm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using pre-trained remote sensing foundation models with deep features significantly outperforms traditional Random Forest classifiers for tree species classification in National Forest Inventories, achieving up to 10% higher accuracy with limited annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NFI maintenance requires labor-intensive field campaigns. Remote sensing combined with machine learning offers opportunities for more frequent and large-scale updates, but current approaches rely on hand-designed features and Random Forest classifiers.

Method: Fine-tuned a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model using deep features extracted from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ERA5 satellites and SRTM data via Google Earth Engine, with few annotated training samples.

Result: The deep learning approach outperformed state-of-the-art NFI classification methods in the Netherlands by up to 10% across all datasets, demonstrating superior performance over traditional hand-defined harmonic features.

Conclusion: Deep AI features from pre-trained foundation models significantly improve tree species classification accuracy for data-limited applications like NFI, complementing existing forest inventory processes using openly available satellite data and models.

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prior-guided video-level regression method for micro-expression analysis that introduces scalable interval selection and synergistic optimization between spotting and recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing micro-expression analysis methods rely on fixed window sizes and hard decisions, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal dynamics. Current video-level regression approaches still depend on manually predefined window-based methods for interval decoding.

Method: Proposes a prior-guided video-level regression method with scalable interval selection strategy that considers temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics. Uses synergistic optimization framework where spotting and recognition tasks share parameters except classification heads.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)^3 and 0.2000 on SAMMLV datasets, demonstrating superior micro-expression spotting and recognition capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling precise spotting of onset, apex, and offset phases while efficiently utilizing limited data through parameter sharing between tasks.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

TL;DR: A quantitative image-processing framework for objective assessment of microsurgical anastomosis skills, replacing subjective evaluation with geometric error modeling and scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current microsurgical anastomosis assessment methods rely on subjective judgment which introduces biases and affects reliability of competence evaluation.

Method: Leverages three hospital datasets with participants at various skill levels, using image-processing techniques and geometric modeling of errors with detection and scoring mechanisms.

Result: The geometric metrics effectively replicate expert raters' scoring for the errors considered, enhancing assessment efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed quantitative framework advances microsurgical training protocols by providing objective, reliable proficiency assessment.

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

*Muhammad Kashif Ali,Eun Woo Im,Dongjin Kim,Tae Hyun Kim,Vivek Gupta,Haonan Luo,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel test-time adaptation method for pixel-level video stabilization that rapidly adapts models to each input video using low-level visual cues, achieving better stability and visual quality with targeted adaptation on high-jerk segments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level synthesis video stabilization methods struggle with robust generalization due to diverse motion profiles and visual content in different videos, making fixed parameters insufficient for optimal performance across varied inputs.

Method: Proposes rapid adaptation at test time using low-level visual cues, a jerk localization module to identify unstable segments, and targeted adaptation strategy focusing on high-jerk areas to maximize stability with fewer adaptation steps.

Result: Significant performance gains even with single adaptation pass, consistently improves various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and quantitative terms across diverse real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The method enables modern stabilizers to overcome limitations of fixed-parameter approaches while maintaining full-frame output and providing user control similar to classical methods, demonstrating versatility and effectiveness across various applications.

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualFairVL is a multimodal prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns vision-language representations for medical imaging, achieving state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis under distribution shifts caused by variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice, addressing limitations of existing debiasing approaches that handle vision and text modalities independently.

Method: Parallel dual-branch architecture separating sensitive and target attributes, orthogonal text anchors via linear projections, cross-attention mechanisms, hypernetwork for instance-aware visual prompts, and prototype-based regularization for feature separation and alignment.

Result: Outperforms full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines on eight medical imaging datasets across four modalities, achieving superior fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution settings with only 3.6M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: DualFairVL effectively addresses cross-modal misalignment and fairness gaps in medical imaging through joint debiasing and alignment, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DQEN enhances HOI detection by improving object and interaction queries through object-aware encoder features and CLIP-based semantic fusion, achieving competitive results on HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DETR-based HOI models use randomly initialized queries that lead to vague representations, limiting effectiveness. Humans in HOI are fixed while objects and interactions are variable, requiring better query enhancement.

Method: Proposes Dual Query Enhancement Network with: 1) Object queries enhanced with object-aware encoder features for better human-object focus, 2) Interaction Semantic Fusion module using CLIP to extract semantic features for interaction query initialization, 3) Auxiliary Prediction Unit to improve interaction feature representation.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on both HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DQEN effectively enhances query representations in HOI detection, addressing limitations of random query initialization and improving model understanding of human-object interactions.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end AI approaches for autonomous vehicles lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind control decisions in complex urban scenarios, which is crucial for trustworthy AI deployment.

Method: Proposed loss functions that promote interpretability by generating sparse and localized feature maps, allowing identification of which image regions contribute to predicted control commands. Comprehensive ablation studies on feature extraction and validation on CARLA benchmarks.

Result: The approach improves interpretability while reducing infractions, yielding a safer high-performance driving model. The monocular non-ensemble model surpassed top-performing CARLA Leaderboard approaches with lower infraction scores and highest route completion rate.

Conclusion: The method successfully enhances interpretability in autonomous driving AI while optimizing control commands, demonstrating that interpretability correlates with improved safety and performance metrics.

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Framework for classifying pedestrian groups vs singles using Transformer models and analyzing spatial/behavioral differences through trajectory data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze differences in space utilization and behavioral patterns between group and single pedestrians for crowd dynamics research.

Method: Segment trajectories into time bins, use Transformer-based pair classification to identify groups/singles, then apply spatial (convex hull, heatmaps) and behavioral (velocity, angle deviation) metrics.

Result: Established classification pipeline and metric framework for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths (60-200 frames).

Conclusion: Provides groundwork for future quantitative analysis of pedestrian interactions, with applications in simulation and space design validation.

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Method: Multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework combining classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation, and self-distillation techniques to transfer fine-scale ecological information from underwater to aerial imagery.

Result: The approach enables large-area segmentation of coral morphotypes from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation and demonstrates flexibility for integrating new classes.

Conclusion: This presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for high-resolution reef monitoring that combines low-cost data collection, weakly supervised deep learning, and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from

segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

*Simpenzwe Honore Leandre,Natenaile Asmamaw Shiferaw,Dillip Rout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel vision model using token mixing, sequence-pooling, and convolutional tokenizers achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 with improved accuracy and efficiency over SDPA transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient and stable vision model that performs well on fixed context-length tasks without relying on complex techniques like data augmentation, positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling.

Method: The model employs token mixing, sequence-pooling mechanisms, and convolutional tokenizers to process visual information efficiently while maintaining high performance.

Result: Significant improvements on CIFAR100: top-1 accuracy increased from 36.50% to 46.29%, top-5 accuracy from 66.33% to 76.31%. The model is more efficient than SDPA transformers when context length < embedding dimension and only 60% the size.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture demonstrates superior performance, efficiency, and training stability without requiring additional techniques, making it a promising approach for fixed context-length vision tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a vision model that adopts token mixing,
sequence-pooling, and convolutional tokenizers to achieve state-of-the-art
performance and efficient inference in fixed context-length tasks. In the
CIFAR100 benchmark, our model significantly improves the baseline of the top 1%
and top 5% validation accuracy from 36.50% to 46.29% and 66.33% to 76.31%,
while being more efficient than the Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA)
transformers when the context length is less than the embedding dimension and
only 60% the size. In addition, the architecture demonstrates high training
stability and does not rely on techniques such as data augmentation like mixup,
positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling. We make our code available

### [102] [USO: Unified Style and Subject-Driven Generation via Disentangled and Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18966)
*Shaojin Wu,Mengqi Huang,Yufeng Cheng,Wenxu Wu,Jiahe Tian,Yiming Luo,Fei Ding,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USO is a unified framework that combines style-driven and subject-driven image generation by disentangling and recomposing content and style features through a novel training approach and benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat style-driven and subject-driven generation as separate tasks, creating an artificial antagonism between style similarity and subject consistency. The authors argue both objectives can be unified under a single framework since they both involve content-style disentanglement and recomposition.

Method: 1) Construct large-scale triplet dataset (content, style, stylized content images); 2) Disentangled learning scheme with style-alignment training and content-style disentanglement training; 3) Style reward-learning paradigm (SRL) to enhance performance; 4) Release USO-Bench benchmark for joint evaluation.

Result: USO achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in both subject consistency and style similarity dimensions, demonstrating successful unification of both objectives.

Conclusion: The paper presents a unified framework that successfully bridges the gap between style-driven and subject-driven generation tasks, showing that both objectives can be effectively achieved simultaneously through proper content-style disentanglement and recomposition techniques.

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

### [103] [Can we make NeRF-based visual localization privacy-preserving?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18971)
*Maxime Pietrantoni,Martin Humenberger,Torsten Sattler,Gabriela Csurka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Privacy-preserving NeRF-based visual localization using self-supervised segmentation instead of RGB images to protect sensitive scene details while maintaining localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF-based visual localization methods inadvertently encode fine scene details in their geometry representations, raising privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based services where sensitive information could be recovered.

Method: Proposes ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation supervision instead of RGB images. The segmentation labels are learned in a self-supervised manner to be coarse enough to obscure identifiable details while remaining discriminative in 3D.

Result: Shows that standard NeRFs store fine-grained details making them vulnerable to privacy attacks. ppNeSF achieves state-of-the-art results for visual localization while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: The proposed privacy-preserving protocol and ppNeSF method successfully address privacy concerns in NeRF-based visual localization by using segmentation-based representations that maintain localization accuracy while protecting sensitive scene information.

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

### [104] [Enhancing Document VQA Models via Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18984)
*Eric López,Artemis Llabrés,Ernest Valveny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAG-based Document VQA improves performance by up to +22.5 ANLS through text retrieval and +5.0 ANLS through visual retrieval, outperforming concatenate-all-pages baselines without requiring OCR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Document VQA systems struggle with multi-page documents due to memory constraints from concatenating all pages or using large vision-language models. RAG offers a more efficient alternative by retrieving relevant segments first.

Method: Systematically evaluated RAG variants: text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR. Tested across multiple models and benchmarks including MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA.

Result: Text-centric variant improved baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, visual variant achieved +5.0 ANLS improvement without text extraction. Retrieval and reranking components drove most gains, while layout-guided chunking strategy didn't help.

Conclusion: Careful evidence selection through RAG consistently boosts accuracy across model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, demonstrating practical value for real-world Document VQA applications.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAS is a new benchmark for evaluating demographic biases (gender, race, age, skin tone) in Vision Language Models, revealing concerning bias levels with scores as low as 2/100, and highlighting the need for multiple question formulations in VQA bias evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As Vision Language Models become critical for real-world applications, understanding their demographic biases is essential to ensure fair and equitable performance across diverse populations.

Method: Introduces GRAS benchmark with diverse demographic coverage and proposes GRAS Bias Score as an interpretable metric. Benchmarks five state-of-the-art VLMs using visual question answering, emphasizing the need for multiple question formulations.

Result: Evaluation reveals concerning bias levels across all tested VLMs, with the least biased model scoring only 2 out of 100 on the GRAS Bias Score. The study also demonstrates that bias assessment requires considering multiple question formulations.

Conclusion: Current VLMs exhibit significant demographic biases, highlighting the urgent need for bias mitigation. The GRAS benchmark provides a comprehensive tool for quantifying and addressing these biases, with code and data made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

### [106] [RoofSeg: An edge-aware transformer-based network for end-to-end roof plane segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19003)
*Siyuan You,Guozheng Xu,Pengwei Zhou,Qiwen Jin,Jian Yao,Li Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoofSeg is a novel end-to-end transformer-based network for roof plane segmentation from LiDAR point clouds that addresses edge accuracy issues through geometric constraints and adaptive loss weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for roof plane segmentation have three main problems: lack of true end-to-end processing, poor feature discriminability near edges leading to inaccurate planar edges, and insufficient consideration of planar geometric characteristics during network training.

Method: Developed RoofSeg - an edge-aware transformer-based network using encoder-decoder framework with learnable plane queries. Includes Edge-Aware Mask Module (EAMM) to incorporate planar geometric priors for edge refinement, adaptive weighting strategy in mask loss, and new plane geometric loss for training constraints.

Result: The proposed method achieves improved segmentation accuracy particularly in edge regions by enhancing feature discriminability and incorporating geometric constraints.

Conclusion: RoofSeg provides a truly end-to-end solution for roof plane segmentation that effectively addresses edge accuracy issues through geometric-aware modules and specialized loss functions, representing an advancement over traditional and current deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

*Riju Marwah,Riya Arora,Navneet Yadav,Himank Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MicroDetect-Net (MDN) is a deep learning model that uses fluorescence microscopy with Nile Red dye staining to detect microplastics in blood samples with 92% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microplastic pollution is widespread and poses serious health risks including liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora imbalance, requiring effective detection methods.

Method: Combines fluorescence microscopy with Nile Red dye staining and convolutional neural networks for segmentation and detection of microplastic fragments in blood samples.

Result: Achieved 92% accuracy, 87.4% IoU, 92.1% F1 score, 90.6% precision, and 93.7% recall on 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images.

Conclusion: MDN demonstrates strong performance in microplastic detection and provides a foundation for applying this approach to human blood samples for health monitoring.

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

*Yi Pan,Yujia Zhang,Michael Kampffmeyer,Xiaoguang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProPy adapts CLIP for partially relevant video retrieval using a prompt pyramid structure and ancestor-descendant interaction mechanism to capture multi-granularity event semantics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods rely on unimodal features and underutilize powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP, creating a gap in leveraging these models for segment-level video retrieval tasks.

Method: ProPy introduces two key innovations: 1) Prompt Pyramid structure to organize event prompts at multiple granularity levels, and 2) Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism for dynamic semantic interaction among events, systematically adapting CLIP architecture for PRVR.

Result: ProPy achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets, significantly outperforming previous models by substantial margins.

Conclusion: The proposed ProPy model successfully bridges the gap in applying CLIP to PRVR tasks through systematic architectural adaptation, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-granularity event semantics and dynamic interaction mechanisms for improved video retrieval performance.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using self-supervised learning on 8449 geometric artery models to improve wall shear stress assessment in coronary arteries with limited clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Big data approaches for patient care are promising but face data scarcity challenges. Current methods require large datasets to train ML models for hemodynamic biomarker assessment like wall shear stress, which is difficult to obtain in clinical settings.

Method: Created self-supervised targets using heat kernel signature computed via Laplacian eigenvectors on 8449 geometric artery models. Used learned geometric representations to boost segmentation of coronary arteries into low, mid, and high wall shear stress regions.

Result: Geometric representations learned from the large dataset improved wall shear stress assessment even when trained on limited clinical data (49 patients).

Conclusion: Self-supervised pre-training on geometric artery models can effectively address data scarcity and improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment in coronary arteries with limited clinical datasets.

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Motivation: Existing surface defect detection methods fail to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability across diverse supervision scenarios and data annotations encountered in real-world manufacturing.

Method: Built on SimpleNet foundation, incorporates novel synthetic anomaly generation process, enhanced classification head, and improved learning procedure to enable efficient training in all four supervision scenarios.

Result: Sets new performance standards across all supervision scenarios on four challenging benchmark datasets, achieves inference time below 10ms, and is the first model capable of fully leveraging all available data annotations.

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet represents a significant advancement in addressing real-world manufacturing challenges by unifying diverse supervision paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, bridging the gap between academic research and industrial applications.

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve single-pixel imaging reconstruction performance, particularly for applications like fluorescence microscopy, by learning optimal binary illumination patterns rather than using generic patterns.

Method: Proposes a bilevel optimization framework using Straight-Through Estimator to handle non-differentiable binary pattern optimization and Total Deep Variation regularizer in the bilevel formulation.

Result: Demonstrated on CytoImageNet microscopy dataset, showing learned patterns achieve superior reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly undersampled scenarios.

Conclusion: The bilevel optimization approach successfully learns task-specific binary illumination patterns that significantly outperform traditional methods in single-pixel imaging applications.

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector

We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using

*Vincenzo Polizzi,Stephen Yang,Quentin Clark,Jonathan Kelly,Igor Gilitschenski,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight vibration-based approach to sustain persistent event generation in static scenes using a rotating unbalanced mass, combined with motion compensation for clean event data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras cannot generate events in static or low-motion scenes under fixed illumination, making them unsuitable for many computer vision tasks. Existing motion stimulation methods require complex hardware.

Method: Uses a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational motion, combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the injected motion to produce clean events.

Result: The method reliably recovers motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection compared to event-based sensing without motion induction.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight vibration approach effectively addresses the static scene limitation of event cameras without requiring complex hardware, enabling reliable event generation for downstream perception tasks.

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

TL;DR: Lightweight UNet++ with topology-aware loss achieves state-of-the-art text line segmentation using only 3 annotated pages per manuscript, significantly improving accuracy and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating text line segmentation for historical documents is challenging due to limited annotated datasets and high annotation costs requiring expert knowledge, making few-shot learning essential.

Method: Pairs a lightweight UNet++ architecture with a connectivity-aware loss function that explicitly penalizes structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended merges. Trains on small patches from just 3 annotated pages per manuscript.

Result: 200% increase in Recognition Accuracy and 75% increase in Line Intersection over Union on U-DIADS-TL dataset. Achieves F-Measure score on par/exceeding DIVA-HisDB competition winner using only 3 annotated pages.

Conclusion: Small, simple architectures with topology-aware loss functions are more accurate and data-efficient than complex alternatives for few-shot historical document text line segmentation.

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

Motivation: Pre-trained language models are sensitive to numerical value magnitudes but ignore measurement units in text descriptions, causing poor 3D comprehension and misleading text features that hinder 3D perception in monocular 3D visual grounding tasks.

Method: Two enhancement methods: 1) 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE) pre-processing that augments distance descriptor diversity in text queries to improve unit mapping comprehension, and 2) Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module that projects text features into geometrically consistent space to guide geometry feature attention.

Result: Substantial improvements over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with 11.94% accuracy gain in the "Far" scenario on the Mono3DRefer dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D-text and geometry enhancement methods effectively address the unit sensitivity problem in pre-trained language models and significantly improve monocular 3D visual grounding performance.

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

### [115] [Beyond flattening: a geometrically principled positional encoding for vision transformers with Weierstrass elliptic functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19167)
*Zhihang Xin,Xitong Hu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WEF-PE is a novel positional encoding method using Weierstrass elliptic functions to better preserve 2D spatial structure in Vision Transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional positional embeddings in Vision Transformers disrupt 2D spatial structure through patch flattening and lack geometric constraints, failing to establish proper correspondence between Euclidean distances and sequential indices.

Method: Proposes Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE) that uses complex domain representation with doubly periodic elliptic functions to naturally encode 2D coordinates and spatial relationships through algebraic addition formulas.

Result: Achieves 63.78% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny, 93.28% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms distance-decay property.

Conclusion: WEF-PE provides mathematically principled 2D positional encoding that enhances geometric inductive bias and semantic focus, outperforming conventional approaches while maintaining translational invariance properties.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

### [117] [FastMesh:Efficient Artistic Mesh Generation via Component Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19188)
*Jeonghwan Kim,Yushi Lan,Armando Fortes,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel mesh generation framework that separates vertex and face generation to reduce redundancy, achieving 8x faster speed and higher quality than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mesh generation approaches tokenize meshes into sequences with redundant vertex representations, leading to inefficiently long token sequences and slow generation processes due to vertex reuse in manifold meshes.

Method: Uses autoregressive model for vertex generation only (reducing tokens to ~23% of existing methods), then employs bidirectional transformer to complete mesh in single step by capturing vertex relationships and constructing adjacency matrix. Includes fidelity enhancer for vertex refinement and post-processing to remove bad edge connections.

Result: Achieves more than 8x faster mesh generation speed compared to state-of-the-art approaches while producing higher mesh quality.

Conclusion: Separating vertex and face generation with specialized models significantly reduces redundancy and improves efficiency in mesh generation, demonstrating superior performance in both speed and quality.

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

### [118] [All-in-One Slider for Attribute Manipulation in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19195)
*Weixin Ye,Hongguang Zhu,Wei Wang,Yahui Liu,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: All-in-One Slider enables multi-attribute control in text-to-image diffusion models without retraining for each new attribute, using sparse semantic decomposition of text embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require training separate sliders for each attribute, leading to parameter redundancy and limited scalability for new attributes.

Method: Decomposes text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute directions to create a general-purpose slider module.

Result: Enables fine-grained control over various attributes, supports zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes, and allows attribute composition.

Conclusion: Provides accurate, scalable attribute manipulation that works with real images through inversion frameworks, significantly improving over previous methods.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

*Julian Ost,Andrea Ramazzina,Amogh Joshi,Maximilian Bömer,Mario Bijelic,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry and controllability, bridging the gap between static neural reconstructions and ungrounded diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural reconstruction methods produce static environments with limited control, while diffusion models lack geometry grounding and causality. There's a need for generating controllable, geometrically accurate 3D driving scenes.

Method: Combines proxy geometry generation with environment representation and score distillation from learned 2D image priors. Allows prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture/structure conditioned on map layouts.

Result: Produces realistic and geometrically consistent 3D generations of complex driving scenes with causal novel view synthesis, object permanence, and explicit 3D geometry estimation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the controllability of diffusion models with the geometric accuracy of neural reconstructions, enabling high-quality 3D scene generation for driving applications.

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

*Jianwen Jiang,Weihong Zeng,Zerong Zheng,Jiaqi Yang,Chao Liang,Wang Liao,Han Liang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniHuman-1.5 is a framework that generates character animations with both physical plausibility and semantic coherence using multimodal guidance and a specialized diffusion architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video avatar models focus on physical likeness but lack deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, and context, producing motions that only synchronize with low-level cues like audio rhythm.

Method: Uses Multimodal Large Language Models to synthesize structured textual representations for high-level semantic guidance, and introduces a Multimodal DiT architecture with Pseudo Last Frame design to fuse multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality conflicts.

Result: Achieves leading performance across comprehensive metrics including lip-sync accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness, and semantic consistency. Shows remarkable extensibility to complex scenarios like multi-person and non-human subjects.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between physical plausibility and semantic coherence in character animation, enabling contextually and emotionally resonant motions through effective multimodal input fusion.

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

TL;DR: VFTrack is a real-time particle tracking framework that automatically detects and tracks carbon nanotube particles in SEM image sequences, enabling kinematic analysis of CNT growth with optimal feature detection and matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CNT growth characterization are limited - ex situ methods provide only static analysis, while in situ techniques require manual initialization and lack continuous per-particle trajectory tracking.

Method: VFTrack integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle tracking framework, systematically evaluating combinations using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories to identify optimal detector-matcher pairs.

Result: ALIKED detector with LightGlue matcher achieved optimal performance (F1-score 0.78, α-score 0.89). VFTrack successfully decomposed motion vectors into axial growth, lateral drift, and oscillations, enabling calculation of heterogeneous growth rates and reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar morphologies.

Conclusion: VFTrack bridges the gap between physics-based models and experimental observation, enabling automated nano-material characterization and real-time optimization of CNT synthesis processes.

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AUSM is a single architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation using sequential mask prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance with faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video foundation models excel at prompted segmentation but lack unified solutions for unprompted segmentation, leaving the field fragmented across task-specific models.

Method: Recasts streaming video segmentation as sequential mask prediction using state-space models, maintaining fixed-size spatial state and enabling parallel training across frames.

Result: Outperforms prior universal streaming video segmentation methods on multiple benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS, MOSE, YouTube-VIS, OVIS) and achieves up to 2.5x faster training on 16-frame sequences.

Conclusion: AUSM provides a unified architecture for both prompted and unprompted video segmentation with improved performance and training efficiency, scaling to arbitrary-length video streams.

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Motivation: To standardize evaluation and facilitate progress in 4D stylization, which lacks dedicated benchmarks despite being an emerging research area.

Method: Style4D framework built on 4D Gaussian Splatting with three components: basic 4DGS representation, Style Gaussian Representation with per-Gaussian MLPs for appearance control, and Holistic Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module using contrastive coherence learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show Style4D achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing fine-grained stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view rendering.

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench serves as a valuable resource for benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, with Style4D establishing a strong baseline for future work.

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for

*Oishi Deb,Anjun Hu,Ashkan Khakzar,Philip Torr,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D is a training-free method that uses language instructions to pose 3D assets through a two-step process involving image generation with structure preservation and multi-view pose optimization using keypoint correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in vision and language models, controlling 3D asset poses through language instructions remains challenging, requiring a method that can manipulate poses while maintaining mesh identity.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Modify image generator with self-attention rewiring (RSActrl) to create target images conditioned on input image and text instruction while maintaining consistent structure, 2) Use multi-view pose optimization with keypoint correspondences instead of differentiable rendering for reliable articulation.

Result: Method successfully manipulates poses across diverse 3D objects and free-form text prompts while preserving original mesh identity. Quantitative evaluations and user study show 85% preference over existing approaches.

Conclusion: Articulate3D provides an effective training-free solution for language-controlled 3D pose manipulation, demonstrating superiority over current methods through keypoint-based optimization and structure-preserving image generation.

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

*Lin Li,Zehuan Huang,Haoran Feng,Gengxiong Zhuang,Rui Chen,Chunchao Guo,Lu Sheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoxHammer is a training-free 3D editing method that performs precise local editing in 3D latent space by preserving contextual features of unedited regions, achieving superior 3D consistency and quality compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D local editing is crucial for game industry and robot interaction, but current methods struggle with precisely preserving unedited regions and maintaining overall coherence when editing multi-view images and reconstructing 3D models.

Method: VoxHammer predicts inversion trajectory of 3D models to obtain inverted latents and key-value tokens, then replaces denoising features of preserved regions with these cached features during the denoising and editing phase to ensure consistent reconstruction.

Result: Experiments show VoxHammer significantly outperforms existing methods in 3D consistency of preserved regions and overall quality, as evaluated on Edit3D-Bench, a new human-annotated dataset with hundreds of carefully labeled 3D editing samples.

Conclusion: The method enables high-quality 3D editing with precise preservation of unedited areas and coherent integration of edited parts, providing promise for synthesizing paired data to support in-context 3D generation applications.

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electromagnetic signals differ significantly from text and images with high heterogeneity, strong background noise, and complex time-frequency structures, preventing direct use of existing general models. Current methods lack cross-task generalization and face dataset scarcity issues.

Method: Built the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset. Developed a length-adaptive multi-signal packing method and hardware-aware training strategy that exploit physical properties of electromagnetic signals for efficient representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals.

Result: EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across many downstream tasks, successfully moving from task-specific models to a unified framework for electromagnetic intelligence.

Conclusion: The EMind foundation model provides a decisive shift toward a unified framework for electromagnetic signal processing, enabling better generalization and performance across diverse communication and sensing tasks through large-scale pretraining and specialized signal handling techniques.

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

### [127] [A Systematic Approach to Predict the Impact of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18439)
*Anders Mølmen Høst,Pierre Lison,Leon Moonen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TRIAGE is an automated LLM-based system that maps CVEs to ATT&CK techniques using a hybrid approach combining rule-based reasoning and in-context learning, improving recall and efficiency over manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vulnerability databases like NVD lack information on real-world impact and TTPs of CVEs, and manual mapping is time-consuming due to the high volume of new vulnerabilities published annually.

Method: Two-pronged approach: 1) Prompt LLM with MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology for initial technique predictions, 2) Use in-context learning with another LLM module, then combine results in a hybrid strategy.

Result: In-context learning outperforms individual mapping methods, hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques, and GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively automate CVE to ATT&CK technique mapping, with TRIAGE making the process more efficient and demonstrating the potential for automated vulnerability impact prediction.

Abstract: Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD),
offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but
often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the
vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a
challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities
published annually makes automated support desirable.
  This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses
Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK
knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE
Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then
combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context
learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach
strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our
evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping
methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We
also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task.
Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the
impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping
CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.
  Keywords: vulnerability impact, CVE, ATT&CK techniques, large language
models, automated mapping.

### [128] [UniC-RAG: Universal Knowledge Corruption Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18652)
*Runpeng Geng,Yanting Wang,Ying Chen,Jinyuan Jia*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: UniC-RAG is a universal knowledge corruption attack that uses optimized adversarial texts to simultaneously compromise multiple diverse queries in RAG systems, achieving high success rates while bypassing existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems are vulnerable to knowledge corruption attacks, but prior work only targeted specific queries or similar topics. There's a need for a universal attack that can compromise diverse queries simultaneously for various malicious objectives.

Method: Formulated as an optimization problem, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts using a balanced similarity-based clustering method to attack multiple queries across different domains simultaneously.

Result: Achieves over 90% attack success rate by injecting only 100 adversarial texts into a knowledge database with millions of texts to attack 2,000 diverse user queries, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: UniC-RAG demonstrates severe vulnerabilities in current RAG systems, and existing defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for new defense mechanisms against universal knowledge corruption attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely deployed in
real-world applications in diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, and
cybersecurity. However, many studies showed that they are vulnerable to
knowledge corruption attacks, where an attacker can inject adversarial texts
into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce the LLM to generate
attacker-desired outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific
queries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose
UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike
prior work, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts that
can simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics
and domains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such
as directing users to malicious websites, triggering harmful command execution,
or launching denial-of-service attacks. We formulate UniC-RAG as an
optimization problem and further design an effective solution to solve it,
including a balanced similarity-based clustering method to enhance the attack's
effectiveness. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly
effective and significantly outperforms baselines. For instance, UniC-RAG could
achieve over 90% attack success rate by injecting 100 adversarial texts into a
knowledge database with millions of texts to simultaneously attack a large set
of user queries (e.g., 2,000). Additionally, we evaluate existing defenses and
show that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the
need for new defense mechanisms in RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FALCON is an autonomous agentic framework that uses LLMs to generate IDS rules from CTI data in real-time with built-in validation, achieving 95% accuracy and reducing deployment delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional signature-based IDS require frequent manual rule updates from CTI, causing deployment delays that weaken security against evolving cyber threats.

Method: FALCON uses LLM-powered agentic systems to autonomously generate IDS rules from CTI data with multi-phased built-in validators, targeting both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) systems.

Result: Achieves 95% average accuracy in automatic rule generation with 84% inter-rater agreement among cybersecurity analysts across all metrics.

Conclusion: LLM-driven autonomous rule generation is feasible and effective for real-time cyber threat mitigation, reducing dependency on manual updates.

Abstract: Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect malicious activities
by matching network or host activity against predefined rules. These rules are
derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack
signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual
threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into
actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and
prevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates
frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security
readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with
internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that
generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them
using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target
both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a
comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our
evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an
average of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84%
inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics.
These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data
mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.

### [130] [The Double-edged Sword of LLM-based Data Reconstruction: Understanding and Mitigating Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Differential Privacy Text Sanitization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18976)
*Stephen Meisenbacher,Alexandra Klymenko,Andreea-Elena Bodea,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLMs can both exploit and improve differentially private text sanitization - they can reconstruct original content from privatized texts but also enhance privacy protection through adversarial post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how Large Language Models can exploit contextual vulnerabilities in differentially private text sanitization methods and explore their dual role in both attacking and defending privacy.

Method: Conducted experiments using advanced LLMs to test various DP sanitization mechanisms at different privacy levels, examining LLM-based data reconstruction attacks on privatized texts.

Result: LLMs can infer original semantics from DP-sanitized texts, potentially degrading privacy, but can also be used to improve the quality and privacy protection of sanitized texts through post-processing.

Conclusion: LLMs present a double-edged sword for text privacy - they can be used for both attacks and defense, suggesting recommendations for using LLM reconstruction as an adversarial post-processing step to enhance privacy protection.

Abstract: Differentially private text sanitization refers to the process of privatizing
texts under the framework of Differential Privacy (DP), providing provable
privacy guarantees while also empirically defending against adversaries seeking
to harm privacy. Despite their simplicity, DP text sanitization methods
operating at the word level exhibit a number of shortcomings, among them the
tendency to leave contextual clues from the original texts due to randomization
during sanitization $\unicode{x2013}$ this we refer to as $\textit{contextual
vulnerability}$. Given the powerful contextual understanding and inference
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we explore to what extent LLMs
can be leveraged to exploit the contextual vulnerability of DP-sanitized texts.
We expand on previous work not only in the use of advanced LLMs, but also in
testing a broader range of sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels.
Our experiments uncover a double-edged sword effect of LLM-based data
reconstruction attacks on privacy and utility: while LLMs can indeed infer
original semantics and sometimes degrade empirical privacy protections, they
can also be used for good, to improve the quality and privacy of DP-sanitized
texts. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for using LLM data
reconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy
protection by thinking adversarially.

*Rui Zhang,Zihan Wang,Tianli Yang,Hongwei Li,Wenbo Jiang,Qingchuan Zhao,Yang Liu,Guowen Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Hidden Tail is a stealthy resource consumption attack on Vision-Language Models that crafts adversarial images to induce maximum-length outputs with invisible special tokens, balancing attack effectiveness with stealthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs have high inference costs making them vulnerable to resource consumption attacks, but existing attacks compromise stealthiness by generating abnormal visible content that can be easily detected.

Method: Uses prompt-agnostic adversarial images with composite loss function balancing semantic preservation, repetitive special token induction, and EOS token suppression, optimized via dynamic weighting strategy.

Result: Increases output length by up to 19.2x, reaches maximum token limit while preserving attack stealthiness, outperforms existing attacks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates urgent need to improve VLM robustness against efficiency-oriented adversarial threats, as current models remain vulnerable to stealthy resource consumption attacks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but their high inference cost makes them vulnerable to resource
consumption attacks. Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by
optimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs. However,
these extended outputs often introduce irrelevant abnormal content,
compromising attack stealthiness. This trade-off between effectiveness and
stealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this
challenge, we propose \textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption
attack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to
generate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users.
Our method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic
preservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the
end-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy.
Extensive experiments show that \textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing
attacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\times$ and reaching the
maximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness. These results
highlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of VLMs against
efficiency-oriented adversarial threats. Our code is available at

*Yipeng Zhang,Chen Wang,Yuzhe Zhang,Jacky Jiang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: A framework that converts natural language queries into query plans instead of SQL, enabling complex analytics like PCA and anomaly detection while handling large datasets efficiently without SQL limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome SQL's inefficiency with large datasets and limited analytical capabilities for non-technical users, providing more flexible data analysis beyond basic querying.

Method: Uses LLMs to iteratively interpret natural language queries and construct operation sequences, executing operations directly on data to avoid context length limitations and SQL constraints.

Result: Validated on standard databases and large scientific tables, demonstrating effectiveness in handling extensive datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses SQL limitations by enabling complex analytical functions and efficient large dataset processing through natural language interfaces.

Abstract: Efficient querying and analysis of large tabular datasets remain significant
challenges, especially for users without expertise in programming languages
like SQL. Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark
data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large
datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying.
We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into
query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases,
allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent
limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as
principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater
flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage
LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences,
addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By
executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length
limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model.
We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and
large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive
datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.

TL;DR: Video-based failure detection using spatio-temporal knowledge of robot actions and task-relevant objects, with data augmentation improving F1 score from 77.9 to 81.4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic task execution requires reliable failure detection for safety and recovery, but existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses spatio-temporal knowledge including robot actions and task-relevant objects from video, with variable frame rate data augmentation.

Result: Improved F1 score from 77.9 to 80.0 without extra computation, and to 81.4 with test-time augmentation on ARMBench dataset.

Conclusion: Spatio-temporal information is crucial for failure detection, and suitable heuristics should be further investigated.

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution
failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task
replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide
meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses
spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and
task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are
available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend,
in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant
knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method
that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts
of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the
ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional
increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the
importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest
further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code

TL;DR: TIG algorithm for UAV path planning uses elliptic tangent intersection method to generate optimal paths in static/dynamic environments, outperforming existing algorithms in speed and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient and safe UAV navigation is critical for applications like combat support, delivery, and search/rescue operations, requiring advanced path planning algorithms.

Method: Uses elliptic tangent intersection method to generate two sub-paths per threat, selects optimal route with heuristic rules, iteratively refines path, and applies quadratic Bézier curves for smoothing considering UAV kinematic constraints.

Result: Generates shortest paths in 0.01 seconds with fewer turning angles, outperforming A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent Graph, and Static APPATT in static environments, and APF/Dynamic APPATT in unknown/dynamic environments.

Conclusion: TIG algorithm provides efficient real-time path planning capabilities for UAV collision avoidance in both static and dynamic environments with superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Efficient and safe navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is critical
for various applications, including combat support, package delivery and Search
and Rescue Operations. This paper introduces the Tangent Intersection Guidance
(TIG) algorithm, an advanced approach for UAV path planning in both static and
dynamic environments. The algorithm uses the elliptic tangent intersection
method to generate feasible paths. It generates two sub-paths for each threat,
selects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines
the path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic
constraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\'ezier curves
is adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show
that the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting
from 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent
Graph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in
completely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient
real-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF
and Dynamic APPATT algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional terrain traversability prediction methods require putting robots in hazardous environments for data collection, posing equipment and safety risks.

Method: Leverages visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create real-time traversability maps through zero-shot learning approach.

Result: Provides safer navigation compared to state-of-the-art methods, consistently reaching final goals in both controlled indoor and unstructured outdoor environments.

Conclusion: ZeST offers a cost-effective, scalable solution that mitigates risks of real-world data collection while accelerating development of advanced navigation systems.

Abstract: The advancement of robotics and autonomous navigation systems hinges on the
ability to accurately predict terrain traversability. Traditional methods for
generating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting
robots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and
safety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging
visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a
traversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach
not only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated
with real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of
advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution.
To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MemoryVLA is a cognition-memory-action framework that addresses temporal context in robotic manipulation by combining working memory with long-term memory storage, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both simulation and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream VLA models overlook temporal context and struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent robotic manipulation tasks, while humans use working memory and hippocampal systems for effective temporal reasoning.

Method: A pretrained VLM encodes observations into perceptual/cognitive tokens for working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores consolidated details. Working memory retrieves relevant entries, fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank. A memory-conditioned diffusion action expert generates temporally aware action sequences.

Result: Achieved 71.9% on SimplerEnv-Bridge, 72.7% on Fractal, and 96.5% on LIBERO-5 suites, outperforming CogACT and pi-0 baselines with +14.6 gain on Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks, achieved 84.0% success rate with +26 improvement on long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: MemoryVLA successfully addresses temporal context challenges in robotic manipulation by drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory systems, demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods across diverse simulation and real-world environments.

Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are
inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and
struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science
suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived
representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves
verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term
memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a
Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A
pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens
that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores
low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory
retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with
current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these
tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware
action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks
across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it
achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on
Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon
temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon
tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline. Project Page:

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: OST-AR systems like HoloLens 2 have depth perception and occlusion challenges. Study shows opaque virtual targets with real tool occlusion yield best depth accuracy and usability, while transparency impairs depth cues without improving usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical see-through AR systems promise arm's distance guidance applications like surgery, but face challenges with depth perception of holograms and occlusion of real instruments, requiring evaluation of different visualization approaches.

Method: Two experiments on HoloLens 2: (1) depth matching task comparing high vs low transparency targets, (2) simulated surgical pinpoint task with 6 conditions (2 transparencies × 3 tool visualization modes: virtual tool, real tool, no tracking). Measured depth error, localization error, usability, workload, and qualitative feedback.

Result: Opaque targets significantly lower depth estimation error than transparent targets. Real tool occlusion yielded highest accuracy and usability with lowest workload. No tool tracking performed worst. Transparency impaired depth cues without usability improvement.

Conclusion: Correct occlusion cues with opaque virtual content occluded by real tools in real time are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers should prioritize robust tool tracking and occlusion handling; use transparency cautiously if unavailable.

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) systems like Microsoft
HoloLens 2 hold promise for arm's distance guidance (e.g., surgery), but depth
perception of the hologram and occlusion of real instruments remain
challenging. We present an evaluation of how visualizing the target object with
different transparencies and visualizing a tracked tool (virtual proxy vs. real
tool vs. no tool tracking) affects depth perception and system usability. Ten
participants performed two experiments on HoloLens 2. In Experiment 1, we
compared high-transparency vs. low-transparency target rendering in a depth
matching task at arm's length. In Experiment 2, participants performed a
simulated surgical pinpoint task on a frontal bone target under six
visualization conditions ($2 \times 3$: two target transparencies and three
tool visualization modes: virtual tool hologram, real tool, or no tool
tracking). We collected data on depth matching error, target localization
error, system usability, task workload, and qualitative feedback. Results show
that a more opaque target yields significantly lower depth estimation error
than a highly transparent target at arm's distance. Moreover, showing the real
tool (occluding the virtual target) led to the highest accuracy and usability
with the lowest workload, while not tracking the tool yielded the worst
performance and user ratings. However, making the target highly transparent,
while allowing the real tool to remain visible, slightly impaired depth cues
and did not improve usability. Our findings underscore that correct occlusion
cues, rendering virtual content opaque and occluding it with real tools in real
time, are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers of
arm-distance AR systems should prioritize robust tool tracking and occlusion
handling; if unavailable, cautiously use transparency to balance depth
perception and tool visibility.

*Eleni Tselepi,Spyridon Thermos,Gerasimos Potamianos*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: First single-shot motion blending framework that enables seamless blending of multiple motions within one generative pass using temporal conditioning and skeleton-aware normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-shot motion generation methods don't offer controllable frameworks for blending two or more motions in a single generative pass, limiting animators' ability to create variations of existing motion patterns.

Method: Introduces skeleton-aware normalization mechanism to guide transitions between motions, enabling smooth data-driven control over blending timing and style through temporal conditioning of the generation process.

Result: Extensive evaluations across various animation styles and kinematic skeletons show the approach produces plausible, smooth, and controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables seamless motion blending in a single-shot generative model, providing animators with controllable variation generation without requiring additional data or extensive retraining.

Abstract: Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence
without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant
attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation,
single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of
existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive
retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a
controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single
generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion
blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning
the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization
mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven
control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and
qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic
skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and
controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

*Xiaohao Sun,Divyam Goel,Angle X. Chang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SemLayoutDiff is a unified diffusion model that generates diverse 3D indoor scenes by first creating semantic layouts and then placing furniture while respecting architectural constraints like doors and windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods cannot condition scene synthesis on architectural constraints, limiting their ability to generate practical and unobstructed furniture arrangements in indoor scenes.

Method: Uses a categorical diffusion model to generate coherent semantic maps conditioned on room masks, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout and architectural elements.

Result: Outperforms previous methods on the 3D-FRONT dataset, producing spatially coherent, realistic, and varied scenes with practical furniture arrangements.

Conclusion: SemLayoutDiff provides an effective unified approach for diverse 3D indoor scene synthesis that explicitly handles architectural constraints and ensures practical furniture placement.

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor
scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout
representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each
object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural
constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of
conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a
coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict
furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also
accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that

on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent,
realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.

### [140] [PanoHair: Detailed Hair Strand Synthesis on Volumetric Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18944)
*Shashikant Verma,Shanmuganathan Raman*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PanoHair is a generative model that synthesizes high-fidelity 3D hair strands from single images using knowledge distillation from a pre-trained head synthesis model, eliminating the need for complex multi-view setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hair strand synthesis methods require complex multi-view studio setups and have slow processing times, making them inefficient for practical applications.

Method: Uses knowledge distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model to estimate head geometry as signed distance fields, then predicts semantic segmentation masks and 3D orientations specifically for hair regions. Includes latent space manipulation for diverse hairstyles and inversion process for real images.

Result: Generates clean manifold hair meshes in under 5 seconds with semantic and orientation maps, significantly faster than existing methods while maintaining high visual quality.

Conclusion: PanoHair provides an efficient, streamlined alternative to complex multi-view hair acquisition systems, enabling rapid high-fidelity hair strand synthesis from single images with latent space control for diverse hairstyle generation.

Abstract: Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike
digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data
acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio
environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation
and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a
model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge
distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.
Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D
orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our
method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space
manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to
infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a
streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given
the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region
in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a
significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our
experiments.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Optimized INPC pipeline with improved rasterizer, better sampling, CNN pre-training, and Gaussian point modeling achieves 25% faster training, 2x faster rendering, 20% reduced VRAM usage with quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INPC combines neural fields with point-based rendering for high-quality novel view synthesis but suffers from slow rendering speeds, limiting practical usability.

Method: Improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, pre-training for CNN hole-filling network, and modeling points as small Gaussians during inference.

Result: Achieves up to 25% faster training, 2x faster rendering, 20% reduced VRAM usage with slight image quality improvements, especially in extrapolated views.

Conclusion: The optimizations significantly improve INPC's performance without sacrificing visual fidelity, making it more practical for real-world applications while maintaining state-of-the-art quality.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that
combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based
rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis.
However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks
during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively
slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that
significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC
without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an
improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the
incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for
hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small
Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g.,
close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly
applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a
series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster
training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight
image quality improvements.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Using 5th generation declarative language for imaging system design improves cross-team alignment and traceability in complex projects like multi-modal drug discovery imagers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in interdisciplinary collaboration where hardware constraints, optical requirements, algorithmic needs, and life sciences requirements must be preserved and aligned across diverse domain stakeholders.

Method: Applied declarative 5GL problem formulation language to formalize project requirements into machine-readable statements, using the 96-Eyes project (96-camera parallel multi-modal imager) as a case study.

Result: Enhanced transparency, ensured design traceability, and minimized costly misalignment across optical, algorithmic, hardware-accelerated compute, and life sciences teams.

Conclusion: Declarative problem formulations can facilitate innovation in concurrent R&D workflows, though adoption faces barriers in environments where imperative 3GL languages remain the default for inter-team collaboration.

Abstract: This article presents a practitioner's reflection on applying declarative,
5th generation, problem formulation language (5GL) to de novo imaging system
design, informed by experiences across the interdisciplinary research in
academia and cross-functional product development within the private sector.
Using the 96-Eyes project: 96-camera parallel multi-modal imager for
high-throughput drug discovery as a representative case, I illustrate how
project requirements, ranging from hardware constraints to life sciences needs,
can be formalized into machine-readable problem statements to preserve
mission-critical input from diverse domain stakeholders. This declarative
approach enhances transparency, ensures design traceability, and minimizes
costly misalignment across optical, algorithmic, hardware-accelerated compute,
and life sciences teams.
  Alongside the technical discussion of 5GL with real-world code examples, I
reflect on the practical barriers to adopting 5GL in environments where
imperative, 3rd-generation languages (3GL) remain the default medium for
inter-team collaboration. Rather than offering an one-size-fits-all solution,
these learned lessons highlight how programming paradigms implicitly shapes
research workflows through existing domain hierarchies. The discussion aims to
invite further explorations into how declarative problem formulations can
facilitate innovation in settings where concurrent R\&{}D workflows are gaining
traction, as opposed to environments where sequential, phase-driven workflows
remain the norm.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that both quantum systems and fractals exhibit complex, self-similar patterns. The authors want to explore how quantum computing principles can be applied to fractal generation, particularly Julia sets, to create unique patterns for quantum generative arts.

Method: The method involves building quantum circuits that utilize quantum mechanical principles - superposition, randomness, and entanglement - to generate Julia set datasets. The approach couples quantum computing with fractal image generation techniques.

Result: The paper demonstrates successful generation of Julia set patterns using quantum circuits, showing that quantum computing can be effectively applied to fractal generation and produce complex, intricate patterns suitable for artistic applications.

Conclusion: Quantum circuits show promise for fractal image generation, particularly Julia sets, opening new research directions in quantum generative arts. This approach can be customized for various applications, such as creating quantum-themed artistic landscapes and exploring the intersection of quantum computing with creative domains.

Abstract: As nature is ascribed as quantum, the fractals also pose some intriguing
appearance which is found in many micro and macro observable entities or
phenomena. Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble
the entire are revealed when zoomed in. In Quantum systems, the probability
density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various
energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such
as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite
its simplicity, the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics produces
incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in
chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using
the principles of quantum-mechanical phenomenon, when applied in fractal image
generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a
Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit,
highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as
foundational elements to manipulate the generated dataset patterns. As Quantum
computing is finding many application areas, the possibility of using quantum
circuits for fractal Julia image generation posits a unique direction of future
research where it can be applied to quantum generative arts across various
ecosystems with a customised approach, such as producing an exciting landscape

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASR models struggle with large-scale hotwords as recognition rates drop dramatically with increasing hotword counts, creating a need for better hotword customization solutions.

Method: Proposes H-PRM that identifies relevant hotword candidates through acoustic similarity measurement between hotwords and speech segments. Can be integrated as plug-and-play with traditional models like SeACo-Paraformer and incorporated into Audio LLMs via prompt-based approach.

Result: Extensive testing shows H-PRM outperforms existing methods and significantly enhances hotwords post-recall rate (PRR).

Conclusion: H-PRM provides an effective solution for hotword customization in ASR, showing a new direction for improving recognition of domain-specific terms at scale.

Abstract: Hotword customization is crucial in ASR to enhance the accuracy of
domain-specific terms. It has been primarily driven by the advancements in
traditional models and Audio large language models (LLMs). However, existing
models often struggle with large-scale hotwords, as the recognition rate drops
dramatically with the number of hotwords increasing. In this paper, we
introduce a novel hotword customization system that utilizes a hotword
pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) to identify the most relevant hotword candidate by
measuring the acoustic similarity between the hotwords and the speech segment.
This plug-and-play solution can be easily integrated into traditional models
such as SeACo-Paraformer, significantly enhancing hotwords post-recall rate
(PRR). Additionally, we incorporate H-PRM into Audio LLMs through a
prompt-based approach, enabling seamless customization of hotwords. Extensive
testing validates that H-PRM can outperform existing methods, showing a new
direction for hotword customization in ASR.

TL;DR: A topological framework combining Transfer Entropy and Persistent Homology to analyze information flow in neural systems through directed graphs and multi-scale topological features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a principled approach for characterizing information flow in neural systems that goes beyond pairwise connectivity and captures global organizational patterns across different scales and dimensions.

Method: Integrates Transfer Entropy (quantifies directional influence between neurons) with directed Persistent Homology (analyzes topological complexity). Applied to synthetic spiking networks, image-classification networks, and mouse cortical recordings.

Result: Topological signatures revealed distinctions in task complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regimes. Higher-dimensional features became more prominent in complex/noisy conditions, capturing interaction patterns beyond pairwise connectivity.

Conclusion: The TE+PH framework provides a generalizable and interpretable approach for mapping directed information flow onto global organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems with time-resolved binary spiking data.

Abstract: We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that
integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to
characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies
directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that
reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling
assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and
dimensions.
  We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic
gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed
inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across
all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task
complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional
features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting
interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings
offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global
organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The
framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural
systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.

Motivation: Scalable and generalizable execution-grounded environments are scarce, limiting progress in training capable ML agents. Current systems lack verifiable feedback loops for effective LLM training.

Method: Developed CTF-Dojo with 658 containerized CTF challenges and CTF-Forge pipeline to automatically transform public artifacts into execution environments. Trained LLM agents on 486 execution-verified trajectories.

Result: Achieved up to 11.6% absolute gains over baselines across three benchmarks. Best 32B model reached 31.9% Pass@1, establishing new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models.

Conclusion: Execution-grounded training signals are effective and pivotal for advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when
trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software
engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and
generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress
in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first
large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable
feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style
challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable
rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated
pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use
execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration
traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality,
execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute
gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF,
NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1,
establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models
like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a

### [147] [Federative ischemic stroke segmentation as alternative to overcome domain-shift multi-institution challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18296)
*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Federated learning framework for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation using DWI sequences, achieving better performance than centralized approaches while maintaining privacy across 14 healthcare centers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics, scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Current computational approaches lack generalization and many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled data for training.

Method: Developed a collaborative framework using federated learning (FedAvg) with deep center-independent representations to share knowledge across 14 healthcare centers with 2031 studies while maintaining data privacy.

Result: FedAvg model achieved DSC of 0.71±0.24, AVD of 5.29±22.74, ALD of 2.16±3.60 and LF1 of 0.70±0.26, outperforming centralized and other federated approaches. Showed strong generalization with DSC of 0.64±0.29 on out-of-distribution centers without additional training.

Conclusion: The federated learning framework provides an effective solution for stroke lesion segmentation that generalizes well across different centers and lesion categories while addressing data privacy concerns and limited labeled data availability.

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel weakly-supervised framework for macular edema segmentation that leverages retinal layer correlation and test-time adaptation to bridge performance gap with fully-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expert-annotated pixel-level datasets for macular edema analysis are expensive to collect, and current weakly-supervised methods underperform compared to fully-supervised approaches.

Method: Enhanced adversarial framework with layer-structure-guided post-processing and test-time adaptation strategy, reframing edema prediction as confirming intersection points between edema contour and retinal layers.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets show improved accuracy and robustness in edema area segmentation, narrowing the performance gap between weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Conclusion: Incorporating retinal layer information and test-time adaptation significantly enhances weakly-supervised macular edema segmentation performance while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

TL;DR: This paper provides the first unified benchmark comparing 7 approaches for segmenting undersampled MRI data, finding that simple two-stage methods with data-consistency outperform complex specialized one-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI acquisition is time-consuming and costly, but perfect reconstruction may not be necessary for downstream tasks like segmentation. There's a lack of comprehensive comparison between methods for segmenting accelerated MRI data.

Method: The study compares 7 approaches on two MRI datasets with multi-coil k-space data and human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. Focuses on comparing one-stage (combined reconstruction+segmentation) vs two-stage (reconstruction followed by segmentation) methods.

Result: Simple two-stage methods that incorporate data-consistency achieved the best segmentation scores, outperforming complex specialized methods developed specifically for this task.

Conclusion: For segmenting accelerated MRI data, straightforward two-stage approaches considering data-consistency are more effective than complex one-stage specialized methods, providing practical guidance for clinical applications.

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

*Yan Chen,Yi Wen,Wei Li,Junchao Liu,Yong Guo,Jie Hu,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RDDM is an end-to-end diffusion model that directly restores photo-realistic images from sensor RAW data, bypassing conventional sRGB processing to achieve higher fidelity with fewer artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sRGB-domain diffusion models face a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation due to processing lossy sRGB inputs and ignoring the availability of sensor RAW data in edge devices, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes RAW-domain VAE (RVAE) for optimal latent representations, differentiable Post Tone Processing (PTP) for joint RAW-sRGB optimization, scalable degradation pipeline for dataset synthesis, and configurable multi-bayer LoRA module for handling diverse RAW patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments show RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, producing higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

Conclusion: RDDM effectively addresses the limitations of sRGB-domain methods by working directly with RAW data, providing an end-to-end solution that outperforms existing approaches in image restoration quality.

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

TL;DR: RF-Deep uses random forest with transformer deep features to detect out-of-distribution CT scans and improve cancer segmentation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models degrade on out-of-distribution data, limiting reliable cancer segmentation across diverse CT scan types.

Method: Combines Swin Transformer encoder (pretrained with SimMIM on 10,432 unlabeled CT scans) with convolution decoder, plus random forest classifier using deep features for OOD detection.

Result: Achieved FPR95 of 18.26% on PE, 27.66% on COVID-19, and <0.1% on abdominal CTs, outperforming established OOD detection methods.

Conclusion: RF-Deep provides simple and effective approach to enhance cancer segmentation reliability in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed
tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer
treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised
pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution
(ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We
address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes
deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model
to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation
model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image
modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and
non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung
cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public
datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest

### [154] [SALMAN: Stability Analysis of Language Models Through the Maps Between Graph-based Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18306)
*Wuxinlin Cheng,Yupeng Cao,Jinwen Wu,Koduvayur Subbalakshmi,Tian Han,Zhuo Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALMAN is a unified robustness framework that evaluates transformer model stability using Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD) measure without modifying model parameters or complex perturbation heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As pretrained transformer models grow in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes increasingly important, but existing methods are labor-intensive and diverge between small and large models.

Method: Proposes a novel Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD) measure that ranks sample susceptibility by comparing input-to-output distance mappings with near-linear complexity, without modifying internal parameters.

Result: Demonstrates significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, showing the framework's practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: SALMAN serves as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the reliability of transformer-based NLP systems through efficient robustness evaluation.

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

### [155] [Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18672)
*Taishi Nakamura,Satoki Ishikawa,Masaki Kawamura,Takumi Okamoto,Daisuke Nohara,Jun Suzuki,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE models show different scaling behaviors: memorization improves with total parameters while reasoning saturates/regresses despite training loss improvements. Sparsity affects generalization gaps, and standard techniques can't fix reasoning deficits in overly sparse models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scaling laws don't account for MoE sparsity dimensions, and it's unclear how sparsity affects different capability regimes (memorization vs reasoning) in large language models.

Method: Trained families of MoE Transformers varying total parameters, active parameters, and top-k routing while keeping compute fixed. Measured pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and accuracy to separate generalization gaps.

Result: Memorization improves with total parameters, while reasoning performance saturates/regresses despite training loss gains. Top-k changes alone have little effect, and standard techniques like RLHF or extra compute don't fix reasoning deficits.

Conclusion: MoE sparsity introduces distinct scaling behaviors between memorization and reasoning capabilities. Current dense-model frontiers overlook this sparsity dimension, and overly sparse models show persistent reasoning deficits that can't be easily remedied.

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training
reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning
deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are
open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes multi-scale feature extraction with uncertainty estimation for unsupervised domain adaptation in time series data, achieving state-of-the-art performance with better calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address distribution shifts between training and testing datasets in time series data to improve model generalization and robustness across domains.

Method: Multi-scale mixed input architecture for feature extraction at different scales, combined with uncertainty awareness mechanism using evidential learning with Dirichlet prior for target prediction and uncertainty estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets with significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.

Conclusion: The combined approach of mixed input architecture with uncertainty awareness mechanism is highly effective for unsupervised domain adaptation in time series data, improving both performance and calibration.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

*V. S. Usatyuk,D. A. Sapoznikov,S. I. Egorov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory, and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification using physics-inspired embeddings with massive compression and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient multi-class image classification system that leverages insights from statistical physics, coding theory, and algebraic topology to achieve high accuracy with significantly compressed feature representations.

Method: High-dimensional features from MobileNetV2 are interpreted as spins on a sparse MET-QC-LDPC graph forming a Random-Bond Ising Model. The system operates at Nishimori temperature where Bethe-Hessian matrix's smallest eigenvalue vanishes. Uses correspondence between local trapping sets and topological invariants, with efficient β_N estimation via quadratic interpolant and Newton correction. Designs spherical and toroidal graph ensembles guided by topology.

Result: Achieves 98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100 with 40x parameter compression (1280D features compressed to 32-64D), demonstrating six-fold speed-up over bisection for β_N estimation.

Conclusion: Topology-guided graph design enables highly efficient, physics-inspired embeddings that maintain state-of-the-art performance despite massive compression, showing the power of interdisciplinary approaches combining physics, coding theory, and topology for computer vision tasks.

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

*Junyu Yan,Feng Chen,Yuyang Xue,Yuning Du,Konstantinos Vilouras,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris,Steven McDonagh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SWiFT is a debiasing framework that improves fairness while preserving model performance with minimal data and training requirements, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models exhibit bias in sensitive domains like healthcare, negatively impacting fairness and generalization while amplifying social discrimination. Existing debiasing methods require extensive retraining and show fairness-performance trade-offs.

Method: Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT) identifies parameter contributions to bias and performance, then uses a two-step fine-tuning process with different gradient flows based on each parameter's contribution.

Result: SWiFT consistently reduces bias across gender, skin tone, and age attributes in dermatological and chest X-ray datasets, achieving competitive or superior diagnostic accuracy and improved generalization on OOD datasets.

Conclusion: SWiFT provides an efficient debiasing solution that requires minimal external data and few training epochs, effectively addressing bias while maintaining model performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-Flat is a plug-and-play method that promotes flatter loss landscapes in continual learning, improving performance across various settings. C-Flat++ further reduces update costs through selective flatness-driven promotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharpness-aware minimization in continual learning may favor sharper minima over flatter ones, leading to less robust solutions. The paper aims to address this by developing methods that promote flatter loss landscapes tailored for continual learning.

Method: Proposes C-Flat, a method that promotes flatter loss landscapes for continual learning with plug-and-play compatibility. Also introduces C-Flat++ which uses selective flatness-driven promotion to reduce update costs. Both methods are integrated into major CL paradigms.

Result: C-Flat consistently improves performance across a wide range of settings. C-Flat++ significantly reduces update costs while maintaining effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness across multiple CL methods, datasets, and scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed C-Flat and C-Flat++ approaches effectively promote flatter loss landscapes in continual learning, leading to improved performance and reduced computational costs, making them valuable contributions to the field.

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

*Jiajie He,Yuechun Gu,Min-Chun Chen,Keke Chen*

TL;DR: This paper investigates privacy risks in LLM-based recommender systems, demonstrating that membership inference attacks can successfully determine if a user's historical interactions were used in system prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based recommender systems use sensitive user interaction data in prompts for in-context learning, creating potential privacy risks that haven't been studied before.

Method: The authors designed four membership inference attacks (direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks) and evaluated them on three LLMs and two benchmark datasets.

Result: The attacks were successful, with direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages, confirming realistic privacy threats in LLM RecSys.

Conclusion: LLM-based recommender systems are vulnerable to membership inference attacks, and factors like number of shots and victim position in prompts affect attack success.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly
adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context
learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions,
which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g.,
implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private
information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been
done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks
(MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been
used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination,
similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features
of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have
been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark
datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic:
direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack
advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as
the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the
shots.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLMR proposes a reinforcement learning method with dynamically mixed rewards to balance subjective writing quality and objective constraint following in creative writing tasks, achieving significant improvements in both aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods struggle to balance subjective writing quality (literariness, emotional expression) and objective constraint following (format requirements, word limits) in creative writing applications.

Method: Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards (RLMR) uses a dynamically mixed reward system combining a writing reward model for subjective quality and a constraint verification model for objective constraints, with weights adjusted based on writing quality within sampled groups.

Result: Achieved improvements in instruction following (IFEval from 83.36% to 86.65%) and writing quality (72.75% win rate in manual expert evaluations on WriteEval benchmark) across models from 8B to 72B parameters.

Conclusion: RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Result: Analysis of 200+ benchmarks reveals key challenges including dynamic assessment needs and interpretability gaps. Provides actionable guidance for developing technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm through human intelligence lens offers a comprehensive framework to bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world utility of LLMs.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs and Agentic AI systems inherit biases from their training data and external sources, which affects fairness, balance of retrieved information, and reduces user trust.

Method: A multi-agent system with specialized agents that orchestrate bias mitigation workflow by optimizing source selection to ensure highly relevant and minimally biased content retrieval.

Result: Experimental results show an 81.82% reduction in bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

Conclusion: The Bias Mitigation Agent effectively addresses bias in AI systems, promoting fair and balanced knowledge dissemination while maintaining content relevance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long chain-of-thought prompts slow down LLMs and degrade performance on fast, intuitive System-1 tasks, creating a need for more efficient reasoning methods.

Method: Connector-Aware Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) restricts reasoning to a fixed set of connector phrases to steer models toward concise, well-structured explanations using synthetic training with Gemini-2.0-Flash.

Result: Achieves ~85% on GSM8K, ~40% on GPQA (System-2 tasks) while maintaining ~90% on S1-Bench (System-1 tasks), with reasoning traces averaging ~300 tokens (one-third of baseline length).

Conclusion: CAC-CoT delivers higher efficiency without accuracy loss, providing shorter reasoning traces while maintaining performance on both System-1 and System-2 tasks.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models consistently fail to provide appropriate abstentions when faced with inherently unanswerable questions like math problems lacking sufficient conditions, which undermines trustworthy AI.

Method: A lightweight two-stage approach that combines cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention to align the model's internal recognition of question flaws with its external abstention behavior.

Result: Experimental results show the method significantly improves abstention rates while maintaining overall reasoning performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively resolves the misalignment between LRMs' internal cognition and external response, enabling more trustworthy abstention behavior for unanswerable questions.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Motivation: As AI advances toward general intelligence, there's a need to shift from systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn continuously through real-world interaction.

Method: Proposes ELL framework with four principles: Experience Exploration, Long-term Memory, Skill Learning, and Knowledge Internalization. Also introduces StuLife benchmark dataset simulating a student's college journey across three phases and ten sub-scenarios.

Result: Developed a comprehensive framework and benchmark for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities including memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs on the StuLife benchmark.

Conclusion: The ELL framework and StuLife benchmark provide a foundation for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous growth, representing a step toward advancing artificial general intelligence through context engineering and lifelong learning approaches.

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

Result: The approach produces diverse, relevant, and literature-grounded research ideas, demonstrating effectiveness as a lightweight and interpretable tool for scientific creativity augmentation.

Conclusion: The modern Llull's thinking machine offers a viable path for collaborative ideation between humans and AI, providing a structured yet flexible framework for research innovation.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepWiser is a generative judge model that meta-reasons about intermediate reasoning steps, providing better accuracy than classification-based approaches and improving both training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current process reward models lack explanations and have limited generalization due to supervised fine-tuning with static datasets, creating a need for more effective stepwise supervision.

Method: Reframe stepwise reward modeling as a reasoning task, using a generative judge that outputs thinking tokens before verdicts, trained with reinforcement learning on relative rollout outcomes.

Result: Better judgment accuracy on intermediate steps than existing methods, ability to improve policy model during training, and enhanced inference-time search performance.

Conclusion: Generative meta-reasoning approach outperforms classification-based methods for stepwise supervision, demonstrating effectiveness in both training improvement and inference optimization.

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

### [169] [Stabilizing Open-Set Test-Time Adaptation via Primary-Auxiliary Filtering and Knowledge-Integrated Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18751)
*Byung-Joon Lee,Jin-Seop Lee,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes PAF-KIP method for open-set test-time adaptation, using dual filtering and knowledge integration to handle domain-shifted test data with unknown classes while maintaining closed-set accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world test data often contains domain shifts and open-set classes not seen during training, which degrades closed-set accuracy in traditional TTA methods that assume same class sets.

Method: Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF) with auxiliary filter validation, and Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP) that combines outputs from adapting model, EMA model, and source model for complementary knowledge integration.

Result: Method enhances both closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination across diverse datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PAF-KIP effectively addresses open-set TTA challenges by improving filtering accuracy and knowledge integration, providing robust performance on domain-shifted test data with unknown classes.

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code

### [170] [Toward Responsible ASR for African American English Speakers: A Scoping Review of Bias and Equity in Speech Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18288)
*Jay L. Cunningham,Adinawa Adjagbodjou,Jeffrey Basoah,Jainaba Jawara,Kowe Kadoma,Aaleyah Lewis*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This scoping review analyzes 44 publications on fairness, bias, and equity in ASR/speech technologies for African American English speakers, identifying four research areas and highlighting a gap in governance-centered approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how fairness and equity are conceptualized and operationalized in ASR technologies for linguistically diverse communities, particularly African American English speakers, to address language marginalization in speech AI systems.

Method: Scoping literature review of 44 peer-reviewed publications across HCI, ML/NLP, and Sociolinguistics, identifying four major areas of inquiry related to ASR harms, inclusive data practices, linguistic inclusion approaches, and equitable design recommendations.

Result: Identified four research areas: understanding ASR-related harms, inclusive data practices, methodological approaches to linguistic inclusion, and equitable design practices. Found critical gap in governance-centered approaches that prioritize community agency and linguistic justice.

Conclusion: Proposes a governance-centered ASR lifecycle as an interdisciplinary framework for responsible ASR development, offering implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to address language marginalization through participatory accountability and linguistic justice approaches.

Abstract: This scoping literature review examines how fairness, bias, and equity are
conceptualized and operationalized in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and
adjacent speech and language technologies (SLT) for African American English
(AAE) speakers and other linguistically diverse communities. Drawing from 44
peer-reviewed publications across Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Machine
Learning/Natural Language Processing (ML/NLP), and Sociolinguistics, we
identify four major areas of inquiry: (1) how researchers understand
ASR-related harms; (2) inclusive data practices spanning collection, curation,
annotation, and model training; (3) methodological and theoretical approaches
to linguistic inclusion; and (4) emerging practices and design recommendations
for more equitable systems. While technical fairness interventions are growing,
our review highlights a critical gap in governance-centered approaches that
foreground community agency, linguistic justice, and participatory
accountability. We propose a governance-centered ASR lifecycle as an emergent
interdisciplinary framework for responsible ASR development and offer
implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to
address language marginalization in speech AI systems.
