### [1] [Are you sure? Measuring models bias in content moderation through uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22699)
*Alessandra Urbinati,Mirko Lai,Simona Frenda,Marco Antonio Stranisci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an unsupervised approach using conformal prediction to measure bias in language models for content moderation by analyzing uncertainty in classifying messages from vulnerable groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models used for content moderation perpetuate racial and social biases, and existing benchmarks don't adequately measure fairness. Current metrics like F1 score don't reveal how models treat different demographic groups.

Method: Used conformal prediction technique to compute uncertainty in model predictions when classifying messages annotated by vulnerable groups (women and non-white annotators). Analyzed 11 pre-trained models to compare uncertainty-based bias measurement with performance-based metrics.

Result: Some pre-trained models achieved high accuracy on minority group labels but with low confidence in predictions. Uncertainty measurement revealed which annotator groups are better represented in models, providing insights for debiasing.

Conclusion: Measuring model confidence through uncertainty analysis is crucial for identifying biases in content moderation systems and guiding debiasing processes before deployment, complementing traditional performance metrics.

Abstract: Automatic content moderation is crucial to ensuring safety in social media.
Language Model-based classifiers are being increasingly adopted for this task,
but it has been shown that they perpetuate racial and social biases. Even if
several resources and benchmark corpora have been developed to challenge this
issue, measuring the fairness of models in content moderation remains an open
issue. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models
on the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people
belonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the
conformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models
against women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges
from metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score. The results show
that some pre-trained models predict with high accuracy the labels coming from
minority groups, even if the confidence in their prediction is low. Therefore,
by measuring the confidence of models, we are able to see which groups of
annotators are better represented in pre-trained models and lead the debiasing
process of these models before their effective use.

### [2] [AccessEval: Benchmarking Disability Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22703)
*Srikant Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AccessEval benchmark evaluates 21 LLMs across 6 domains and 9 disability types, revealing that disability-aware queries receive more negative, stereotyped, and factually inaccurate responses compared to neutral queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate disparities in how LLMs handle real-life queries across various disability contexts, as these models are increasingly deployed across diverse domains.

Method: Introduced AccessEval benchmark evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9 disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries, with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and factual accuracy.

Result: Responses to disability-aware queries have more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual errors compared to neutral queries, with hearing, speech, and mobility disabilities disproportionately impacted, reflecting embedded ableism.

Conclusion: These disparities can translate into tangible harms for disabled users, highlighting the importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day applications and bridging the gap between technical evaluation and user impact.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains
but often exhibit disparities in how they handle real-life queries. To
systematically investigate these effects within various disability contexts, we
introduce \textbf{AccessEval (Accessibility Evaluation)}, a benchmark
evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9
disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries. We
evaluated model outputs with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and
factual accuracy.
  Our analysis reveals that responses to disability-aware queries tend to have
a more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual error compared
to neutral queries. These effects show notable variation by domain and
disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility
disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of
ableism embedded in model behavior.
  By examining model performance in real-world decision-making contexts, we
better illuminate how such biases can translate into tangible harms for
disabled users. This framing helps bridges the gap between technical evaluation
and user impact, reinforcing importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day
applications. Our dataset is publicly available at:

### [3] [RAR$^2$: Retrieval-Augmented Medical Reasoning via Thought-Driven Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22713)
*Kaishuai Xu,Wenjun Hou,Yi Cheng,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAR² is a joint learning framework that improves both Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning for medical QA, using thought processes to guide retrieval and answer generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG struggles with complex medical questions requiring intensive reasoning, as surface-level input fails to reflect true knowledge needs. Existing methods focus on query refinement without modeling reasoning processes.

Method: Proposes RAR² framework that constructs thought processes to uncover implicit knowledge requirements, uses DPO training on mixed preference pairs, and implements test-time scaling strategies.

Result: Outperforms RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning across several biomedical question answering datasets.

Conclusion: RAR² effectively addresses limitations of traditional RAG in complex medical reasoning tasks by jointly optimizing retrieval and reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on diverse
medical benchmarks, highlighting their potential in supporting real-world
clinical tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key
approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating
external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical
questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails
to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically
focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process,
limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge.
In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both
Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$
constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and
uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset
of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to
train the model. Moreover, we design two test-time scaling strategies to
explore the boundaries of our framework. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAR$^2$ across several biomedical question answering datasets,
outperforming RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning.

### [4] [TRUEBench: Can LLM Response Meet Real-world Constraints as Productivity Assistant?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22715)
*Jiho Park,Jongyoon Song,Minjin Choi,Kyuho Heo,Taehun Huh,Ji Won Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRUEBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM-based productivity assistants that addresses limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating multilingual prompts, implicit constraints, and multi-turn dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately evaluate LLMs' real-world instruction-following capabilities due to insufficient multilinguality, inability to capture implicit constraints, and overlooking multi-turn dialogue complexities.

Method: TRUEBench features prompts across 12 languages, includes intra-instance multilingual instructions, uses rigorous evaluation criteria for explicit and implicit constraints, incorporates complex multi-turn dialogues with accumulating constraints and context switches, and employs an LLM validator for constraint refinement.

Result: Experiments show TRUEBench is significantly more challenging than existing benchmarks, with even strong models like OpenAI o1 achieving only a 69.07% overall pass rate.

Conclusion: TRUEBench provides a demanding and realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, effectively highlighting their capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral as productivity
assistants, but existing benchmarks fall short in rigorously evaluating their
real-world instruction-following capabilities. Current benchmarks often (i)
lack sufficient multilinguality, (ii) fail to capture the implicit constraints
inherent in user requests, and (iii) overlook the complexities of multi-turn
dialogue. To address these critical gaps and provide a more realistic
assessment, we introduce TRUEBench (Trustworthy Real-world Usage Evaluation
Benchmark)1, a novel benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based productivity
assistants. TRUEBench distinguishes itself by featuring input prompts across 12
languages, incorporating intra-instance multilingual instructions, employing
rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints,
and including complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with both accumulating
constraints and context switches. Furthermore, to ensure reliability in
evaluation, we refined constraints using an LLM validator. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater
challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI
o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench offers a demanding and
realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting
their capabilities and limitations.

### [5] [Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis with Dynamic Attention Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22729)
*Sadia Abdulhalim,Muaz Albaghdadi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DAF is a lightweight multimodal framework that combines text and acoustic features using adaptive attention, outperforming unimodal and static fusion methods without finetuning encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional unimodal sentiment analysis ignores non-verbal cues like vocal tone and prosody that are essential for capturing true emotional intent.

Method: Dynamic Attention Fusion (DAF) combines frozen text embeddings from pretrained language models with acoustic features from speech encoders using adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality per utterance.

Result: DAF consistently outperforms static fusion and unimodal baselines on large multimodal benchmark, with notable gains in F1-score and reductions in prediction error.

Conclusion: Dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for modeling emotionally complex inputs, offering more robust sentiment prediction with broader impact for affective computing applications.

Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis has long been a unimodal task, relying solely
on text. This approach overlooks non-verbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody
that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic
Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text
embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a
speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality
per utterance. Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed
DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on
a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and
reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that
support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for
modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and
non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for
sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing
applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more
natural human computer interaction.

### [6] [Enabling Approximate Joint Sampling in Diffusion LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22738)
*Parikshit Bansal,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for approximate joint sampling in masked diffusion language models that allows unmasking multiple tokens per forward pass while maintaining distribution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order, but sampling from the true joint distribution requires one token per forward pass, which is slow. Parallel unmasking speeds up generation but degrades accuracy.

Method: Developed a lightweight single-layer sampler on top of existing diffusion LMs. One full-model forward pass is followed by multiple sampler-only passes to yield multiple unmasked tokens, trained to mimic exact joint sampling from the frozen full model.

Result: When unmasking 4 tokens per denoising step, achieved MAUVE score of 0.87 vs marginal baseline of 0.31 on pretrained and instruction-tuned models, showing effectiveness on language modeling and math & coding tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approximate joint sampling method enables faster generation in diffusion language models while maintaining distribution quality close to the true joint distribution.

Abstract: In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on
all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked
diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and
potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking
in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the
further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the
resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a
way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution
in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight
single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward
pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only
this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained
to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the
effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only
(Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language
modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each
full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of
0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint
distribution.

### [7] [Painless Activation Steering: An Automated, Lightweight Approach for Post-Training Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22739)
*Sasha Cui,Zhongren Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAS is a fully automated activation steering method that eliminates the need for manual prompt construction or feature labeling, providing a practical alternative to traditional post-training methods like RL and SFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current activation steering methods require hand-crafted prompt pairs or labor-intensive feature annotation, making them inconvenient compared to plug-and-play methods like RL and SFT. PAS aims to make activation steering readily usable with any labeled dataset without human intervention.

Method: PAS is a family of fully automated activation steering methods that construct fast, lightweight activation vectors that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. It works with any given labeled dataset without needing prompt construction or feature labeling.

Result: PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, 34.8% on Alignment) but not for intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the strongest causal steering effects. PAS also provides additional gains on top of In-Context Learning and SFT.

Conclusion: PAS provides a practical, automated LM post-training option that characterizes where activation steering helps (behavior tasks) and where it fails (intelligence tasks), offering a fast, lightweight alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and
behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is
time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and
often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises
a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training
methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or
labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the
plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of
fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled
dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human
intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models
(Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks;
we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for
intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the
strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8%
on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context
Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector
that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results
provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy
it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.

### [8] [MIRAGE: Multi-hop Reasoning with Ambiguity Evaluation for Illusory Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22750)
*Jeonghyun Park,Ingeol Baek,Seunghyun Yoon,Haeun Jang,Aparna Garimella,Akriti Jain,Nedim Lipka,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIRAGE benchmark introduces ambiguous multi-hop QA where each reasoning step requires ambiguity resolution, showing LLMs struggle with this challenge. CLARION framework significantly outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-hop QA involves inherent ambiguity that requires resolving multiple reasoning paths at each step, creating a distinct challenge that current LLMs fail to handle effectively.

Method: Created MIRAGE benchmark with 1,142 ambiguous multi-hop questions categorized by syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity. Proposed CLARION framework as a multi-agent solution for clarifying ambiguity during reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art models struggle significantly on MIRAGE, confirming that combining ambiguity resolution with multi-step inference is a distinct challenge. CLARION framework substantially outperforms existing approaches.

Conclusion: Multi-hop reasoning with ambiguity requires specialized approaches beyond current LLM capabilities. CLARION provides a robust baseline for developing more adaptive and robust reasoning systems that can handle layered ambiguity.

Abstract: Real-world Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) often involves ambiguity that is
inseparable from the reasoning process itself. This ambiguity creates a
distinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single
question, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is
ambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a
single question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the
reasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in
this setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing
incomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce
MultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE),
a benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of
ambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142
high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a
taxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a
rigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming that resolving ambiguity
combined with multi-step inference is a distinct and significant challenge. To
establish a robust baseline, we propose CLarifying Ambiguity with a Reasoning
and InstructiON (CLARION), a multi-agent framework that significantly
outperforms existing approaches on MIRAGE, paving the way for more adaptive and
robust reasoning systems.

*Ekaterina Trofimova,Zosia Shamina,Maria Selifanova,Artem Zaitsev,Remi Savchuk,Maxim Minets,Daria Ozerova,Emil Sataev,Denis Zuenko,Andrey E. Ustyuzhanin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ML2B is the first benchmark for evaluating multilingual ML code generation, covering 30 Kaggle competitions translated into 13 languages, revealing 15-45% performance degradation on non-English tasks compared to English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML code generation benchmarks are mainly restricted to English, overlooking the global and multilingual nature of ML research and practice.

Method: Created ML2B benchmark with 30 Kaggle competitions translated into 13 languages covering tabular, text, and image data types, using structured metadata and validated human-reviewed translations. Employed AIDE framework for automated end-to-end assessment.

Result: Substantial 15-45% performance degradation on non-English tasks compared to English, highlighting challenges in multilingual representation learning for code generation.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals critical challenges in multilingual ML code generation and provides resources for future research through publicly available GitHub repository.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in generating machine learning (ML) code, enabling end-to-end pipeline
construction from natural language instructions. However, existing benchmarks
for ML code generation are mainly restricted to English, overlooking the global
and multilingual nature of ML research and practice. To address this gap, we
present ML2B, the first benchmark for evaluating multilingual ML code
generation. ML2B consists of 30 Kaggle competitions translated into 13 natural
languages, covering tabular, text, and image data types, with structured
metadata and validated human-reviewed translations. For evaluation, we employ
AIDE, an automated framework for end-to-end assessment of data science
pipelines, and provide insights into cross-lingual model performance. Our
results reveal substantial 15-45% performance degradation on non-English tasks,
highlighting critical challenges in multilingual representation learning for
code generation. The benchmark, evaluation framework, and comprehensive results
are made available through our GitHub repository to facilitate future research
in multilingual ML code generation: https://github.com/enaix/ml2b.

### [10] [ArFake: A Multi-Dialect Benchmark and Baselines for Arabic Spoof-Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22808)
*Mohamed Maged,Alhassan Ehab,Ali Mekky,Besher Hassan,Shady Shehata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech dataset and evaluates various TTS models to identify which produces the most challenging synthetic speech for spoof detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic language has received limited research attention in spoof detection compared to English, and there's a significant gap for Arabic and its many dialects in distinguishing real vs synthetic speech.

Method: Created evaluation pipeline including: training classifiers with embedding-based methods + classifier heads; classical ML on MFCC features; RawNet2 architecture; Mean Opinion Score from human ratings; and ASR model processing to measure Word Error Rate.

Result: FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and challenging synthetic speech samples.

Conclusion: While FishSpeech performs best, relying on a single TTS for dataset creation may limit generalizability.

Abstract: With the rise of generative text-to-speech models, distinguishing between
real and synthetic speech has become challenging, especially for Arabic that
have received limited research attention. Most spoof detection efforts have
focused on English, leaving a significant gap for Arabic and its many dialects.
In this work, we introduce the first multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech
dataset. To evaluate the difficulty of the synthesized audio from each model
and determine which produces the most challenging samples, we aimed to guide
the construction of our final dataset either by merging audios from multiple
models or by selecting the best-performing model, we conducted an evaluation
pipeline that included training classifiers using two approaches: modern
embedding-based methods combined with classifier heads; classical machine
learning algorithms applied to MFCC features; and the RawNet2 architecture. The
pipeline further incorporated the calculation of Mean Opinion Score based on
human ratings, as well as processing both original and synthesized datasets
through an Automatic Speech Recognition model to measure the Word Error Rate.
Our results demonstrate that FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic
voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and
challenging synthetic speech samples. However, relying on a single TTS for
dataset creation may limit generalizability.

### [11] [EditGRPO: Reinforcement Learning with Post -Rollout Edits for Clinically Accurate Chest X-Ray Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22812)
*Kai Zhang,Christopher Malon,Lichao Sun,Martin Renqiang Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EditGRPO is a mixed-policy RL algorithm that optimizes radiology report generation using clinically motivated rewards, outperforming SFT and vanilla GRPO baselines with better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for radiology report generation use SFT objectives that are not explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy, requiring better optimization methods.

Method: EditGRPO integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts, addressing RL exploration and sampling efficiency issues.

Result: Applied to Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM, EditGRPO achieved 3.4% average improvement in CheXbert, GREEN, Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four chest X-ray datasets, with 5.9% better out-of-domain generalization.

Conclusion: EditGRPO effectively optimizes radiology report generation through clinically aligned rewards and demonstrates superior performance and generalization compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Radiology report generation requires advanced medical image analysis,
effective temporal reasoning, and accurate text generation. Although recent
innovations, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), have shown
improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not
explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO,
a mixed-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed specifically to
optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO
integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting
sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy
approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues
typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM initialized with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO
baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4% in CheXbert, GREEN,
Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four major chest X-ray report generation
datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain
generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9% on unseen datasets.

### [12] [Critique-Coder: Enhancing Coder Models by Critique Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22824)
*Chi Ruan,Dongfu Jiang,Yubo Wang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL) that teaches LLMs to critique solutions, and shows that combining CRL with standard RL (Critique-Coder) improves code generation and general reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL focuses on generating responses but lacks explicit critique mechanisms. Recent studies show benefits of teaching LLMs to critique, motivating the development of CRL.

Method: Introduces CRL where models generate critiques for (question, solution) pairs, rewarded based on alignment with ground-truth judgments. Combines RL with CRL (20% CRL data) in Critique-Coder.

Result: Critique-Coder consistently outperforms RL-only baselines, achieving >60% on LiveCodeBench (v5) and better performance on logic reasoning tasks from BBEH dataset.

Conclusion: CRL effectively complements standard RL for LLM reasoning, enhancing both coding performance and general reasoning abilities that transfer across tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm,
particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily
focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster
critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT)
and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly
teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique
Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a
critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely
by whether the final judgment label $c \in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}$
of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building
on this point, we introduce \textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a
hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL
data. We fine-tune multiple models (\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them
on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show
that \textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all
the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach
over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like
DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \textsc{Critique-Coder} also
demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better
performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that
the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and
critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks.
Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM
reasoning.

### [13] [ChatInject: Abusing Chat Templates for Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22830)
*Hwan Chang,Yonghyun Jun,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatInject is a new attack method that exploits LLM agents' vulnerability to structured chat templates and multi-turn persuasive dialogues, achieving significantly higher success rates than traditional prompt injection attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing deployment of LLM-based agents interacting with external environments creates new attack surfaces, particularly through indirect prompt injection where malicious instructions are embedded in environment output.

Method: ChatInject formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates and uses persuasion-driven multi-turn dialogues to prime agents to accept suspicious actions across conversational turns.

Result: ChatInject achieved average attack success rates of 32.05% on AgentDojo (vs 5.18% traditional) and 45.90% on InjecAgent (vs 15.13% traditional), with multi-turn variants reaching 52.33% success on InjecAgent. The attacks showed strong transferability across models and bypassed existing defenses.

Conclusion: Current agent systems have significant vulnerabilities to chat-template-based attacks, and existing prompt-based defenses are largely ineffective, especially against multi-turn persuasion variants.

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that
interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for
adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where
attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing
agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While
previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we
find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on
structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation
through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject,
an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates,
thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies.
Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant
that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute
otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier
LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves
significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt
injection methods, improving from 5.18% to 32.05% on AgentDojo and from 15.13%
to 45.90% on InjecAgent, with multi-turn dialogues showing particularly strong
performance at average 52.33% success rate on InjecAgent, (2)
chat-template-based payloads demonstrate strong transferability across models
and remain effective even against closed-source LLMs, despite their unknown
template structures, and (3) existing prompt-based defenses are largely
ineffective against this attack approach, especially against Multi-turn
variants. These findings highlight vulnerabilities in current agent systems.

### [14] [Learning to Detect Relevant Contexts and Knowledge for Response Selection in Retrieval-based Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22845)
*Kai Hua,Zhiyuan Feng,Chongyang Tao,Rui Yan,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RSM-DCK model improves knowledge-grounded dialogue by detecting relevant parts of context and knowledge to avoid excessive useless information that harms response selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-based dialogue systems use all context and knowledge content for matching, but much information is irrelevant due to topic shifts, which negatively impacts performance.

Method: Uses recent context as query to pre-select relevant context and knowledge at word/utterance levels, then interacts response candidate with selected content, and finally uses fused context-response representation to post-select knowledge for confident matching.

Result: Achieves better performance than existing methods on two benchmark datasets and effectively detects relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

Conclusion: The proposed RSM-DCK model successfully addresses the problem of irrelevant information in context and knowledge by implementing multi-level selection mechanisms, leading to improved response selection performance.

Abstract: Recently, knowledge-grounded conversations in the open domain gain great
attention from researchers. Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems
have paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching
model, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the
response candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different
parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing
the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic
shift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can
influence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address
this problem, we propose a multi-turn \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}election
\textbf{M}odel that can \textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the
\textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge collection (\textbf{RSM-DCK}). Our
model first uses the recent context as a query to pre-select relevant parts of
the context and knowledge collection at the word-level and utterance-level
semantics. Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context
and knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of
the context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant
parts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching. We test our
proposed model on two benchmark datasets. Evaluation results indicate that our
model achieves better performance than the existing methods, and can
effectively detect the relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

### [15] [Towards Generalizable Implicit In-Context Learning with Attention Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22854)
*Jiaqian Li,Yanshu Li,Ligong Han,Ruixiang Tang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICR is a novel implicit in-context learning method that extracts reusable structural patterns from attention logits to achieve few-shot performance at zero-shot cost, outperforming existing methods and showing strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit ICL methods rely on injecting shift vectors from labeled demonstrations or task-specific alignment, which don't utilize the structural mechanisms of ICL and have limited generalizability.

Method: In-Context Routing (ICR) internalizes generalizable ICL patterns at the attention logits level, extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL, and uses a learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits in a train-once-and-reuse framework.

Result: ICR consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods on 12 real-world datasets across diverse domains and multiple LLMs, and demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle.

Conclusion: ICR pushes the boundary of ICL's practical value by providing a more generalizable and effective approach to implicit in-context learning.

Abstract: Implicit in-context learning (ICL) has newly emerged as a promising paradigm
that simulates ICL behaviors in the representation space of Large Language
Models (LLMs), aiming to attain few-shot performance at zero-shot cost.
However, existing approaches largely rely on injecting shift vectors into
residual flows, which are typically constructed from labeled demonstrations or
task-specific alignment. Such designs fall short of utilizing the structural
mechanisms underlying ICL and suffer from limited generalizability. To address
this, we propose In-Context Routing (ICR), a novel implicit ICL method that
internalizes generalizable ICL patterns at the attention logits level. It
extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL and employs a
learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits accordingly,
enabling a train-once-and-reuse framework. We evaluate ICR on 12 real-world
datasets spanning diverse domains and multiple LLMs. The results show that ICR
consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods that require task-specific
retrieval or training, while demonstrating robust generalization to
out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle. These findings position
ICR to push the boundary of ICL's practical value.

### [16] [The Bias is in the Details: An Assessment of Cognitive Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22856)
*R. Alexander Knipper,Charles S. Knipper,Kaiqi Zhang,Valerie Sims,Clint Bowers,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large-scale evaluation of 45 LLMs reveals they exhibit cognitive biases in 17.8-57.3% of instances across 8 bias types, with model size and prompt specificity significantly affecting bias susceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in real-world decision-making, it's crucial to examine their cognitive biases, which are systematic distortions in human judgment extensively studied in psychology.

Method: Introduced novel evaluation framework using multiple-choice tasks, curated dataset of 220 decision scenarios with psychologists, and scalable approach for generating diverse prompts from human-authored templates. Analyzed over 2.8 million LLM responses across 45 models.

Result: LLMs showed bias-consistent behavior across anchoring, availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect theory, and representativeness biases. Larger models (>32B parameters) reduced bias in 39.5% of cases, while detailed prompts reduced most biases by up to 14.9% (except overattribution, which increased by 8.8%).

Conclusion: LLMs systematically exhibit cognitive biases similar to humans, with model size and prompt engineering being important factors in mitigating or exacerbating these biases.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in real-world
decision-making processes, it becomes crucial to examine the extent to which
they exhibit cognitive biases. Extensively studied in the field of psychology,
cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human
judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight
well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million
LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this,
we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks,
hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive
biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for
generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis
shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances
across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring,
availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect
theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt
specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger
size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt
detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case
(Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.

*Passant Elchafei,Mayar Osama,Mohamed Rageh,Mervat Abuelkheir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid graph-transformer approach for Arabic document readability prediction that combines GNN with lexical features and transformer embeddings, showing fusion benefits at document level but GNN superiority at sentence level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective method for predicting document-level readability in Arabic by leveraging both graph-based structural relationships and contextual language understanding.

Method: Model documents as sentence-level graphs with nodes for sentences/lemmas and edges for linguistic relationships. Use SAMER lexicon features and Arabic transformer embeddings. Train GNN and transformer as independent branches with late fusion, and aggregate sentence-level predictions via max pooling.

Result: The hybrid fusion method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer approaches across multiple readability metrics at document level, while GNN-only approach performs better for sentence-level readability prediction.

Conclusion: Fusion of graph-based and transformer approaches offers advantages for document-level readability assessment, but GNN remains superior for precise sentence-level readability prediction in Arabic.

Abstract: We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict
document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained
Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a
sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges
capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class
membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as
well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph
neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two
independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at
inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated
using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results
show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches
across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that
fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach
remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.

### [18] [HEART: Emotionally-driven test-time scaling of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22876)
*Gabriela Pinto,Palash Goyal,Yiwen Song,Souradip Chakraborty,Zifeng Wang,Tomas Pfister,Hamid Palangi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HEART is a novel framework that uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction in language models, leveraging affective feedback based on six universal emotions to improve reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling strategies focus on logical refinement but don't leverage affective feedback, despite psychological research showing emotions can modulate cognitive performance.

Method: HEART provides feedback on incorrect responses using concise, emotionally charged phrases based on Ekman's six universal emotions, systematically varying emotional tone across iterations to guide models away from flawed reasoning paths.

Result: When guided by an oracle verifier, HEART unlocks significantly deeper reasoning with consistent and substantial accuracy increases over state-of-the-art baselines. However, in verifier-free settings, it struggles to consistently harness these gains.

Conclusion: The next frontier in machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding and leveraging the 'HEART' of models through affective iteration protocols.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance
of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical
or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of
affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions
can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that
uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides
feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise,
emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by
Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback
across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths
and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on
challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam,
and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by
an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly
deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy
over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also
identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free
setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a
key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in
machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding
and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

*EunJeong Hwang,Yuwei Yin,Giuseppe Carenini,Peter West,Vered Shwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs that explicitly use Theory of Mind (ToM) achieve better dialogue performance and goal achievement, with ToMAgent (ToMA) showing significant improvements in strategic reasoning and social interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chatbots and LLM-based social agents lack Theory of Mind (ToM) - understanding others' mental states - which is crucial for human social intelligence. Integrating ToM could improve dialogue effectiveness and goal achievement.

Method: Introduced ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent trained by pairing ToM with dialogue lookahead to produce maximally useful mental states for achieving dialogue goals. Simple prompting to generate mental states between dialogue turns also provided benefits.

Result: Experiments on Sotopia interactive social evaluation benchmark showed ToMA outperforms baselines, exhibiting more strategic, goal-oriented reasoning behaviors that enable long-horizon adaptation while maintaining better partner relationships.

Conclusion: Explicit integration of Theory of Mind represents a significant step forward in building socially intelligent LLM agents, enabling more effective dialogue and goal achievement.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-an understanding of the mental states of others-is a key
aspect of human social intelligence, yet, chatbots and LLM-based social agents
do not typically integrate it. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs that
explicitly use ToM get better at dialogue, achieving goals more effectively.
After showing that simply prompting models to generate mental states between
dialogue turns already provides significant benefit, we further introduce
ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent. ToMA is trained by pairing ToM
with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for
achieving dialogue goals. Experiments on the Sotopia interactive social
evaluation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over a range
of baselines. Comprehensive analysis shows that ToMA exhibits more strategic,
goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, which enable long-horizon adaptation, while
maintaining better relationships with their partners. Our results suggest a
step forward in integrating ToM for building socially intelligent LLM agents.

TL;DR: Extract-0 is a 7B parameter model optimized for document information extraction, outperforming larger models like GPT-4 through synthetic data generation, LoRA fine-tuning, and GRPO reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that task-specific optimization can create models that surpass general-purpose systems while using substantially fewer computational resources.

Method: Combines synthetic data generation (280,128 examples), supervised fine-tuning with LoRA (modifying only 0.53% of weights), and reinforcement learning with GRPO using a novel semantic similarity-based reward function.

Result: Achieves mean reward of 0.573 on 1,000 document extraction tasks, outperforming GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459).

Conclusion: Task-specific optimization yields superior performance over general-purpose models with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: This paper presents Extract-0, a 7-billion parameter language model
specifically optimized for document information extraction that achieves
performance exceeding models with parameter counts several orders of magnitude
larger. Through a novel combination of synthetic data generation, supervised
fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and reinforcement learning via
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Extract-0 achieves a mean reward of
0.573 on a benchmark of 1,000 diverse document extraction tasks, outperforming
GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459). The training methodology
employs a memory-preserving synthetic data generation pipeline that produces
280,128 training examples from diverse document sources, followed by
parameterefficient fine-tuning that modifies only 0.53% of model weights (40.4M
out of 7.66B parameters). The reinforcement learning phase introduces a novel
semantic similarity-based reward function that handles the inherent ambiguity
in information extraction tasks. This research demonstrates that task-specific
optimization can yield models that surpass general-purpose systems while
requiring substantially fewer computational resource.

*Kelli Henry,Steven Xu,Kaitlin Blotske,Moriah Cargile,Erin F. Barreto,Brian Murray,Susan Smith,Seth R. Bauer,Yanjun Gao,Tianming Liu,Andrea Sikora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4o performs poorly on medical medication tasks including drug-formulation matching, drug-drug interaction identification, and medication order preparation, highlighting the need for domain-specific training and better evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate GPT-4o's consistency in recommending appropriate medication regimens, as few studies have assessed LLM performance on medication-related tasks despite their potential utility in medical diagnosis.

Method: Three experiments using GPT-4o: drug-formulation matching, drug-drug interaction identification (with and without web search), and medication order preparation. Evaluation used cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors, Levenshtein similarity, ROUGE scores, and clinician manual evaluation.

Result: Poor performance across all tests: 49% accuracy in drug-formulation matching with frequent omissions and hallucinations; inconsistent drug-drug interaction identification (54.7% with internal knowledge vs 69.2% with search); only 65.8% of medication orders were error-free. Performance worsened with more formulations and web search sometimes decreased accuracy.

Conclusion: GPT-4o's overall poor performance on medication tasks demonstrates the need for domain-specific training using clinician-annotated datasets and comprehensive evaluation frameworks for benchmarking medical LLM performance.

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) can be useful in diagnosing medical
conditions, but few studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending
appropriate medication regimens. The purpose of this evaluation was to test
GPT-4o on three medication benchmarking tests including mapping a drug name to
its correct formulation, identifying drug-drug interactions using both its
internal knowledge and using a web search, and preparing a medication order
sentence after being given the medication name. Methods: Using GTP-4o three
experiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine
similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and
ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual
evaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation
matching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per
medication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per
medication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all
available formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more
formulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying
drug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the
search-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs.
69.2%, p=0.013). However, allowing a web-search worsened performance when there
was no drug-drug interaction (median % correct 100% vs. 40%, p<0.001). Finally,
GPT-4o performed moderately with preparing a medication order sentence, with
only 65.8% of medication order sentences containing no medication or
abbreviation errors. Conclusions: Model performance was overall poor for all
tests. This highlights the need for domain-specific training through
clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for
benchmarking performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SceneIllustrations dataset for narrative scene illustration using LLMs to prompt text-to-image models, showing LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge for generating story illustrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage generative AI's capability to transform content across mediums, specifically for storytelling where visual illustrations can enhance text-based narratives.

Method: A pipeline using LLMs as interface for prompting text-to-image models to generate scene illustrations from raw story text, applied to a story corpus with human annotation for quality evaluation.

Result: Created SceneIllustrations dataset with pairwise quality judgments, demonstrating LLMs can effectively verbalize implicit scene knowledge from story text for illustration generation.

Conclusion: LLMs' capability to verbalize scene knowledge is impactful for generating and evaluating narrative illustrations, providing a new resource for cross-modal narrative transformation research.

Abstract: Generative AI has established the opportunity to readily transform content
from one medium to another. This capability is especially powerful for
storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally
expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene
illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a
scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we
consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image
models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply
variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize
illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task
to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of
this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new
resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our
analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we
demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly
evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and
evaluating illustrations.

*Mohammed Sabry,Anya Belz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Explicitly training induction circuits with synthetic data (Bi-Induct) accelerates induction-head emergence but doesn't consistently improve in-context learning performance compared to natural text training at iso-FLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate induction-head emergence and enhance in-context learning, challenging the assumption that early induction circuit activation directly improves ICL.

Method: Introduced Bi-Induct curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or balanced mix into pretraining stream. Trained models from 0.13B to 1B parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating few-shot ICL benchmarks, head-level telemetry, and language modeling perplexity.

Result: Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at small scales but doesn't yield stronger generalization. Natural-only models performed best on function-style ICL probes. Larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier induction heads without explicit patterns. Ablating top induction heads degrades ICL more for natural-only models.

Conclusion: Inducing activation is not sufficient for ICL gains - circuits must become functionally necessary. Results emphasize mechanism-aware pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing structure rather than merely present structure.

Abstract: Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve
in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held
constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate
induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight
curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a
balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B
parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii)
head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our
findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation
directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at
small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On
standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on
function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests
(e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these
trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier
induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails
to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data
shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns
with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades
ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating
more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more
redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall,
inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits
becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware
pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely
present, structure.

*Jon Gauthier,Canaan Breiss,Matthew Leonard,Edward F. Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised speech models for word recognition exhibit linear geometric structures that link English nouns/verbs to their inflected forms, tracking distributional relationships rather than direct phonological/morphological units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what types of linguistic representations self-supervised speech models use for word recognition in noisy environments, particularly how they handle phonological and morphological phenomena in English inflections.

Method: Study S3M variants optimized for word recognition by analyzing how they represent phonological and morphological phenomena in frequent English noun and verb inflections, examining the geometric structure of their representations.

Result: The models' representations show a global linear geometry that can link English nouns and verbs to their regular inflected forms, but this structure tracks regular distributional relationships in the lexicon rather than direct phonological or morphological units.

Conclusion: These findings suggest alternative representational strategies for spoken word recognition that challenge the necessity of distinct linguistic representations for phonology and morphology in human cognition.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models can be trained to efficiently recognize spoken
words in naturalistic, noisy environments. However, we do not understand the
types of linguistic representations these models use to accomplish this task.
To address this question, we study how S3M variants optimized for word
recognition represent phonological and morphological phenomena in frequent
English noun and verb inflections. We find that their representations exhibit a
global linear geometry which can be used to link English nouns and verbs to
their regular inflected forms.
  This geometric structure does not directly track phonological or
morphological units. Instead, it tracks the regular distributional
relationships linking many word pairs in the English lexicon -- often, but not
always, due to morphological inflection. These findings point to candidate
representational strategies that may support human spoken word recognition,
challenging the presumed necessity of distinct linguistic representations of
phonology and morphology.

*Yue Zhang,Seiji Maekawa,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First controlled study examining how table representation affects Table QA performance, showing that no single method excels across all conditions and highlighting trade-offs between SQL-based methods, LLMs, and hybrid approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Table QA benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and haven't systematically examined how representation itself affects model performance, despite real-world settings requiring operation over both structured databases and semi-structured tables.

Method: Created a verbalization pipeline to generate paired structured and semi-structured tables with identical content, enabling direct comparisons. Introduced diagnostic benchmark with splits along table size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality.

Result: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data; LLMs show flexibility but reduced precision; hybrid approaches balance performance, especially under noisy schemas. Effects intensify with larger tables and more complex queries.

Conclusion: No single method excels across all conditions, and table representation plays a central role in shaping Table QA performance. Findings provide actionable insights for model selection and design, paving the way for more robust hybrid approaches.

Abstract: Table Question Answering (Table QA) in real-world settings must operate over
both structured databases and semi-structured tables containing textual fields.
However, existing benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and have not
systematically examined how representation itself affects model performance. We
present the first controlled study that isolates the role of table
representation by holding content constant while varying structure. Using a
verbalization pipeline, we generate paired structured and semi-structured
tables, enabling direct comparisons across modeling paradigms. To support
detailed analysis, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark with splits along table
size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality. Our experiments
reveal consistent trade-offs: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on
structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data, LLMs exhibit flexibility
but reduced precision, and hybrid approaches strike a balance, particularly
under noisy schemas. These effects intensify with larger tables and more
complex queries. Ultimately, no single method excels across all conditions, and
we highlight the central role of representation in shaping Table QA
performance. Our findings provide actionable insights for model selection and
design, paving the way for more robust hybrid approaches suited for diverse
real-world data formats.

*Jasin Cekinmez,Omid Ghahroodi,Saad Fowad Chandle,Dhiman Gupta,Ehsaneddin Asgari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADAM is a framework for evaluating MLLMs in biographical reasoning, featuring a multilingual multimodal dataset (AdamDB), cognitive evaluations (AdamBench), and a retrieval-augmented generation system (AdamRAG) to reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biographical reasoning is a critical yet underexplored dimension of factual knowledge in LLMs, with existing models struggling with hallucinations especially for lesser-known individuals.

Method: Created AdamDB dataset covering 4M+ individuals across geography/time/profession, AdamBench evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy across 6 reasoning levels, and AdamRAG retrieval-augmented generation system for biographical contexts.

Result: AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits closed-source ones, with largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval.

Conclusion: ADAM establishes the first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally grounded biographical evaluation, advancing multilingual, accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating
and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical
reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet
underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a
multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across
geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively
structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels
in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly
for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that
AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits
closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity
strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers
smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the
first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create multi-genre resources for comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated texts linguistically, ensuring comparability with existing human-created corpora.

Method: Generated corpora using various LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, Meta, DeepSeek) from GPT-3 to GPT-4.5, replicating BE21 and Koditex human reference corpora, with Universal Dependencies annotation.

Result: Created English corpus with 27M tokens (avg 864k per model) and Czech corpus with 21.5M tokens (avg 768k per model), freely available under CC licenses and accessible through Czech National Corpus interface.

Conclusion: Successfully developed comprehensive LLM-generated corpora for linguistic research, providing valuable resources for comparing human and AI-generated text characteristics.

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with
large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for
comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis
was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of
topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing
human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human
corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown
Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in
Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic,
Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and
are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are
tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The
subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on
average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on
average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely
available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are
under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence) and are also accessible through the search
interface of the Czech National Corpus.

TL;DR: ReMemR1 is a memory-augmented agent with callback-enhanced memory that enables selective retrieval from entire memory history and non-linear reasoning, combined with multi-level reinforcement learning for improved long-context question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 'memorize while reading' methods for long-context QA suffer from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals.

Method: Proposes ReMemR1 with callback-enhanced memory for selective retrieval from entire memory history and non-linear reasoning, plus Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards (RLMLR) that combines final-answer rewards with dense step-level signals.

Result: Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing memory-based approaches, validating ReMemR1 as an effective solution for long-context reasoning agents.

Conclusion: The proposed approach mitigates information degradation, improves supervision, and supports multi-hop memory utilization in long-context reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering,
where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens.
Existing works equip large language models with a memory corpus that is
dynamically updated during a single-pass document scan, also known as the
"memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it
suffers from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through
overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these
challenges, we present ReMemR1, a memory-augmented agent with callback-enhanced
memory that allows selective retrieval from the entire memory history and
allows non-linear reasoning and revisiting of early evidence. To further
strengthen training, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards
(RLMLR), which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals
that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate
information degradation, improve supervision, and support multi-hop memory
utilizing. Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing
memory-based approaches, which validates ReMemR1 as an effective solution for
long-context reasoning agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' sycophancy (excessive agreeability) undermines multi-agent debating systems by causing premature consensus, reducing debate effectiveness and accuracy below single-agent baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs' inherent sycophancy affects multi-agent debating systems, particularly inter-agent sycophancy which remains poorly understood despite previous focus on user-LLM sycophancy.

Method: Developed first operational framework including formal sycophancy definition for MADS, new evaluation metrics, and systematic investigation of sycophancy effects across agent roles in decentralized and centralized debate frameworks.

Result: Sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse before reaching correct conclusions, yields lower accuracy than single-agent baselines, and stems from distinct debater-driven and judge-driven failure modes.

Conclusion: Proposed actionable design principles for MADS to effectively balance productive disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions, addressing sycophancy-related challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often display sycophancy, a tendency toward
excessive agreeability. This behavior poses significant challenges for
multi-agent debating systems (MADS) that rely on productive disagreement to
refine arguments and foster innovative thinking. LLMs' inherent sycophancy can
collapse debates into premature consensus, potentially undermining the benefits
of multi-agent debate. While prior studies focus on user--LLM sycophancy, the
impact of inter-agent sycophancy in debate remains poorly understood. To
address this gap, we introduce the first operational framework that (1)
proposes a formal definition of sycophancy specific to MADS settings, (2)
develops new metrics to evaluate the agent sycophancy level and its impact on
information exchange in MADS, and (3) systematically investigates how varying
levels of sycophancy across agent roles (debaters and judges) affects outcomes
in both decentralized and centralized debate frameworks. Our findings reveal
that sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse
before reaching a correct conclusion in multi-agent debates, yields lower
accuracy than single-agent baselines, and arises from distinct debater-driven
and judge-driven failure modes. Building on these findings, we propose
actionable design principles for MADS, effectively balancing productive
disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions.

### [30] [Semantic Voting: A Self-Evaluation-Free Approach for Efficient LLM Self-Improvement on Unverifiable Open-ended Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23067)
*Chunyang Jiang,Yonggang Zhang,Yiyang Cai,Chi-Min Chan,Yulong Liu,Mingming Chen,Wei Xue,Yike Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes semantic voting as a self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable tasks like translation, using semantic similarity instead of exact matching to enable lightweight self-improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high computational overhead and overconfidence issues in self-evaluation methods for LLM self-improvement on unverifiable tasks, where traditional majority voting doesn't work due to open-ended responses.

Method: Semantic voting mechanism that replaces hard matching (exact matching) with soft matching (semantic similarity) using lightweight sentence embedding models to quantify similarity between responses.

Result: Achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

Conclusion: Semantic voting provides an effective self-evaluation-free alternative for unverifiable tasks, overcoming computational burden and bias limitations of existing self-evaluation approaches.

Abstract: The rising cost of acquiring supervised data has driven significant interest
in self-improvement for large language models (LLMs). Straightforward
unsupervised signals like majority voting have proven effective in generating
pseudo-labels for verifiable tasks, while their applicability to unverifiable
tasks (e.g., translation) is limited by the open-ended character of responses.
As a result, self-evaluation mechanisms (e.g., self-judging and entropy
minimization) are predominantly used to derive pseudo-labels. However,
self-evaluation relying on LLMs typically incurs high computational overhead
and introduces overconfidence issues due to intrinsic biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable
tasks, designed for lightweight yet effective self-improvement. Inspired by
majority voting commonly employed in verifiable tasks, we propose semantic
voting as a novel mechanism that relaxes the principle of hard matching (i.e.,
exact matching) toward soft matching (i.e., semantic similarity). Soft matching
is achieved by leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model to quantify
semantic similarity, thereby mitigating excessive computational burden and
intrinsic bias-associated limitations of self-evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial gains in
computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation
methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EviPath is a new paradigm for synthesizing evidence-anchored reasoning paths to train RAG agents, enabling LLMs to learn complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities from synthesized data without process-level supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG agent development lacks process-level supervision for guiding agentic capabilities like task decomposition and stepwise decision-making. Reinforcement learning suffers from sparse rewards, and existing data synthesis methods fail to model environmental interactions.

Method: EviPath has three components: (1) Abductive Subtask Planning for problem decomposition and optimal path planning, (2) Faithful Sub-question Answering using evidence to generate reasoning thoughts, and (3) Conversational Fine-Tuning to format interaction trajectories for supervised fine-tuning.

Result: An 8B parameter model trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a 14.7% absolute EM gain in open-domain question answering.

Conclusion: EviPath enables LLMs to effectively learn complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data, addressing the supervision gap in RAG agent development.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of
process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task
decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While
reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse
rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought
rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we
propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG
agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which
decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal
solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful
Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy
environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question;
and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete
agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for
Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and
tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on
widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model
trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of
14.7% in open-domain question answering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding uncertainty in large language models for creative tasks where multiple valid outputs exist, and the need to quantify and decompose this uncertainty calibrated against human creative variation.

Method: Geometric framework using credal sets (convex hulls of probability distributions), analyzing 500 creative writing prompts from WritingPrompts dataset with 10 human continuations each, evaluating four language models across five decoding strategies (100,000 stories total).

Result: Substantial gaps in capturing human creative variation (best model-human calibration only 0.434), decoding strategy contributes 39.4%-72.0% of total epistemic uncertainty, model scale shows weak correlation with calibration quality, no significant difference between base and instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: The geometric framework provides actionable insights for improving generation systems for human-AI creative alignment, with complete experimental framework released.

Abstract: Understanding uncertainty in large language models remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly in creative tasks where multiple valid outputs exist.
We present a geometric framework using credal sets - convex hulls of
probability distributions - to quantify and decompose uncertainty in neural
text generation, calibrated against human creative variation. Analyzing 500
creative writing prompts from the WritingPrompts dataset with 10 unique human
continuations each, we evaluate four language models across five decoding
strategies, generating 100,000 stories. Our credal set analysis reveals
substantial gaps in capturing human creative variation, with the best
model-human calibration reaching only 0.434 (Gemma-2B with temperature 0.7). We
decompose total uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, finding
that the choice of decoding strategy contributes 39.4% to 72.0% of total
epistemic uncertainty. Model scale shows weak correlation with calibration
quality and no significant difference exists between base and instruction-tuned
models in calibration quality. Our geometric framework provides actionable
insights for improving generation systems for human-AI creative alignment. We
release our complete experimental framework.

TL;DR: d²Cache is a training-free KV cache framework that accelerates diffusion-based LLM inference through adaptive token selection and KV state management, achieving both speed improvements and better generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based LLMs suffer from inferior inference efficiency due to bidirectional attention that prevents direct use of standard KV caching like autoregressive models.

Method: Two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while caching remaining tokens' KV states for reuse.

Result: Achieved substantial inference speedups and consistent improvements in generation quality on LLaDA and Dream models, with quasi left-to-right generation capability.

Conclusion: d²Cache effectively addresses dLLM inference efficiency issues without requiring retraining, offering both performance acceleration and enhanced generation reliability.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), despite their promising
performance, still suffer from inferior inference efficiency. This is because
dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention and cannot directly benefit from the
standard key-value (KV) cache as autoregressive models (ARMs) do. To tackle
this issue, we introduce \textit{Dual aDaptive Cache} (d$^2$Cache), which is a
training-free approximate KV cache framework for accelerating dLLM inference.
d$^2$Cache features a two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify
tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while
caching the KV states of the remaining tokens for reuse. Furthermore,
d$^2$Cache naturally offers a more reliable decoding alternative, which can
enable quasi left-to-right generation and mitigate premature overconfidence in
tokens at the end of the sequence. Extensive experimental results on two
representative dLLMs (\ie, LLaDA and Dream) demonstrate that d$^2$Cache not
only achieves substantial inference speedups, but also yields consistent
improvements in generation quality. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings, limiting their practical applications in drug discovery and materials science.

Method: Introduces SmiSelf framework that converts invalid SMILES to SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct invalid SMILES while maintaining compatibility with all SMILES-based generative models.

Result: SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing performance on other metrics. The framework performs better than using SELFIES directly with LLMs.

Conclusion: SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications in biomedicine by solving the validity problem in molecule generation, providing a robust solution compatible with existing SMILES-based models.

Abstract: Molecule generation is key to drug discovery and materials science, enabling
the design of novel compounds with specific properties. Large language models
(LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of tasks from just a few examples.
However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is
challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings. In this work, we explore how LLMs
can generate 100% valid molecules. We evaluate whether LLMs can use SELFIES, a
representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, for valid
molecule generation but find that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES than with
SMILES. We then examine LLMs' ability to correct invalid SMILES and find their
capacity limited. Finally, we introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language
framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to
SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the
invalid SMILES. Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while
preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing
performance on other metrics. SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications
in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models. Code

Abstract: Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to
accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods
to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user
simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors,
which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the
real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture
that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting
unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing
impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can
simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably
delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our
experiments on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench reveal significant performance
degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative
users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each
non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue
breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation
framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively
diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with personalization reasoning - analyzing user history and generating tailored responses based on individual preferences.

Method: Data-driven pipeline generates semantically labeled reasoning chains, followed by SFT and multi-stage RL with composite rewards including tag constraints and PRMU for user-specific alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results with 32.65% average improvement over base model on LaMP benchmark and self-constructed dataset.

Conclusion: Structured, interpretable reasoning is an effective pathway to unlock genuine personalization capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with impressive
general reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with personalization
reasoning - the crucial ability to analyze user history, infer unique
preferences, and generate tailored responses. To address this limitation, we
introduce TagPR, a novel training framework that significantly enhances an
LLM's intrinsic capacity for personalization reasoning through a tagging the
thought approach. Our method first develops a data-driven pipeline to
automatically generate and semantically label reasoning chains, creating a
structured dataset that fosters interpretable reasoning. We then propose a
synergistic training strategy that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on
this tagged data to establish foundational reasoning patterns, followed by a
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) process. This RL phase is guided by a
unique composite reward signal, which integrates tag-based constraints and a
novel Personalization Reward Model with User Embeddings (PRMU) to achieve
fine-grained alignment with user-specific logic. Extensive experiments on the
public LaMP benchmark and a self-constructed dataset demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results, delivering an average improvement
of 32.65% over the base model across all tasks. Our work validates that
structured, interpretable reasoning is a highly effective pathway to unlocking
genuine personalization capabilities in LLMs.

TL;DR: TReASURe is a tree-search method for aligning Masked Diffusion Language Models that addresses correlation and variance issues through UnmaskBranch diversification and ResubstituteScore pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree search for aligning generative models faces challenges with correlated branches from parallel unmasking and high-variance reward estimates from sampled completions, limiting exploration and pruning stability.

Method: Proposes UnmaskBranch for diversified token content and reveal order with single model call per parent, and ResubstituteScore for low-variance deterministic scoring of partially masked sequences.

Result: Achieves SOTA on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, sentiment and toxicity control, outperforming prior methods under matched compute budgets, especially in low-NFE regimes.

Conclusion: TReASURe effectively addresses key challenges in tree search for masked diffusion models through novel branching and scoring strategies, demonstrating strong empirical performance and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning
generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search
to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges:
(i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration,
and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance
estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search
test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i)
UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that
diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per
parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic
resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy
completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs
(number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the
true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove
improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves
state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control
of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute
budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.

TL;DR: The paper proposes T2PAM, a new paradigm for adapting LLMs during multi-turn interactions using real-time user feedback, and introduces ROSA, a lightweight algorithm that enables efficient in-conversation self-correction with theoretical convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform poorly in extended interactions because they are trained on static, single-turn data and cannot adapt to real-time user feedback, limiting their effectiveness in complex multi-turn tasks.

Method: Proposes T2PAM paradigm that uses ongoing user feedback as reward signal to estimate optimal policy, then updates small parameter subset. Introduces ROSA algorithm that performs one-step adaptation toward theoretical optimal policy without iterative optimization.

Result: ROSA achieves significant improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency on challenging benchmarks, with theoretical guarantees that policy converges to user preferences as interactions increase.

Conclusion: The proposed T2PAM paradigm and ROSA algorithm enable efficient in-conversation self-correction for LLMs, addressing the limitation of static training and improving performance in extended multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employ multi-turn interaction as a fundamental
paradigm for completing complex tasks. However, their performance often
degrades in extended interactions, as they are typically trained on static,
single-turn data, which hinders their ability to adapt to real-time user
feedback. To address this limitation, we first propose a new paradigm:
Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM), which utilizes
user feedback from the ongoing interaction as a reward signal to estimate a
latent optimal policy aligned with user preferences, then updates a small
subset of parameters to steer the model toward this policy, ultimately enabling
efficient in-conversation self-correction. We then introduce Optimum-Referenced
One-Step Adaptation (ROSA), a lightweight algorithm that operationalizes T2PAM.
ROSA guides the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a
single, efficient update step, avoiding costly iterative gradient-based
optimization and minimizing computational overhead. We provide a rigorous
theoretical analysis guaranteeing that the policy of ROSA converges to the
preference of user as the number of interactions increases. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmark demonstrate that ROSA achieves significant
improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts generates intermediate latent representations before predicting tokens, improving performance without increasing inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by Chain-of-Thought's success at test-time, the authors explore whether similar computational step scaling during pretraining can enhance individual token generation.

Method: Pretrain LM to first generate intermediate latent thoughts (last hidden states) which are then used as input to predict subsequent tokens, enabling refinement in continuous space.

Result: A 1.4B model with latent thoughts outperforms a 2.8B vanilla model on language modeling and downstream tasks. Performance improves consistently with more latent thoughts.

Conclusion: Scaling computational steps during pretraining via latent thoughts significantly enhances model performance without increasing inference cost, analogous to Chain-of-Thought benefits.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which enhances performance
by scaling generation steps at test-time, inspires us to ask: can we leverage a
similar scaling of computational steps during pretraining to improve the
generation of each individual token? To address this, we propose a novel
pre-training methodology: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts. Our
approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate
latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used
as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational
step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous
space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM
that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard
model with double the parameters. For instance, ours-1.4B (Pythia Arch),
pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla
Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of
general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts
generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to
CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.

TL;DR: The paper addresses hierarchical compliance failures in LLM-powered multi-agent systems by proposing a three-stage framework (CRAS, attention drift analysis, SAIL) to diagnose, localize, and align instruction conflicts through surgical layer optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliability-critical deployment of LLM-powered multi-agent systems is hindered by hierarchical compliance failures under instruction conflicts, where agents misprioritize system-level rules when facing competing demands. Current macro-level metrics obscure these micro-level violations.

Method: A three-stage framework: (1) CRAS metric for context-aware role adherence scoring, (2) attention drift analysis to localize conflict resolution in middle layers, (3) SAIL method using LoRA on focal layers with token-weighted DPO-style preference optimization.

Result: The surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance (e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without requiring full-model finetuning, demonstrating effectiveness across standard benchmarks and MAS frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses hierarchical compliance failures in multi-agent systems through targeted diagnosis, localization, and alignment, enabling more reliable deployment without full-model retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have rapidly
advanced collaborative reasoning, tool use, and role-specialized coordination
in complex tasks. However, reliability-critical deployment remains hindered by
a systemic failure mode: hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts
(system-user, peer-peer), where agents misprioritize system-level rules in the
presence of competing demands. Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g.,
pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable
guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage
framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a
query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into
four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing
that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely
concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction
Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and
optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens
by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS
frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance
(e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.

### [41] [Estimating the strength and timing of syntactic structure building in naturalistic reading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23195)
*Nan Wang,Jiaxuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses EEG and eye-tracking data to show that phrase structure construction precedes syntactic category detection during natural reading, challenging traditional violation paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle syntactic category detection and phrase structure construction processes in sentence processing, which are conflated in traditional violation paradigms.

Method: Used co-registered EEG and eye-tracking data from ZuCo corpus, analyzed gaze transitions, applied Bayesian network modeling, and examined fixation-related potentials during naturalistic reading.

Result: Readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads rather than following serial word order; structural depth was the strongest driver of reading deviations; syntactic surprisal influenced neural activity before word onset and during early integration.

Conclusion: Phrase structure construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences, supporting a predictive 'tree-scaffolding' account of comprehension that extends current models of syntactic timing.

Abstract: A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence
processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which
conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase
structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows
category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking
data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their
temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze
transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads,
suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize
scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was
the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical
familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated
that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to
-10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend
current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure
construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences,
supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.

*Haonan Wang,Weida Liang,Zihang Fu,Nie Zheng,Yifan Zhang,Yao Tong,Tongyao Zhu,Hao Jiang,Chuang Li,Jiaying Wu,Kenji Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recent reasoning LLMs perform worse with few-shot CoT than direct answering. The paper identifies semantic misguidance and strategy transfer failure as causes, and introduces I2S/I2S+ methods that convert demonstrations into explicit insights to improve reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the paradox where reasoning LLMs perform worse with few-shot Chain-of-Thought demonstrations than with direct answering, despite using high-quality reasoning traces.

Method: Introduces Insight-to-Solve (I2S) - a sequential test-time procedure that converts demonstrations into explicit, reusable insights and derives target-specific reasoning traces, with optional self-refinement (I2S+).

Result: I2S and I2S+ consistently outperform direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across diverse benchmarks and models. GPT-4.1 improved by +14.0% on AIME'25, and o1-mini improved by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on GPQA.

Conclusion: In-context demonstrations can be effectively harnessed through the insight-refine-solve framework, overcoming the limitations of traditional few-shot CoT approaches.

Abstract: Recent reasoning LLMs (RLMs), especially those trained with verifier-based
reinforcement learning, often perform worse with few-shot CoT than with direct
answering. We revisit this paradox using high-quality reasoning traces from
DeepSeek-R1 as demonstrations and find that adding more exemplars consistently
degrades accuracy, even when demonstrations are optimal. A detailed analysis
reveals two mechanisms behind this decline: (i) semantic misguidance, where
high textual similarity leads the model to treat the target as the same as the
exemplar and to copy intermediate steps verbatim; and (ii) strategy transfer
failure, where the model struggles to extract useful reasoning strategies and
apply them to target questions. Guided by these, we introduce Insight-to-Solve
(I2S), a sequential test-time procedure that turns demonstrations into
explicit, reusable insights and derives a target-specific reasoning trace;
optionally, the reasoning is self-refined for coherence and correctness (I2S+).
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that I2S and I2S+ consistently
outperform both direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across open-
and closed-source models. Even for GPT models, our method helps: on AIME'25,
GPT-4.1 rises by +14.0%, and o1-mini improves by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on
GPQA, indicating that in-context demonstrations can be harnessed effectively
via insight-refine-solve framework.

*Aditya Narayan Sankaran,Reza Farahbakhsh,Noel Crespi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of code-switching patterns in globally successful K-pop songs shows English dominance, high code-switching frequency, no significant gender differences in language use, and strategic linguistic adaptation for different chart markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate linguistic strategies in K-pop songs achieving global chart success, focusing on code-switching and English usage patterns across different performers and chart contexts.

Method: Compiled dataset of K-pop songs on Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts (2017-2025) from 14 groups and 8 solo artists; analyzed English/Korean proportions, code-switching frequency, stylistic features; performed statistical tests and gender classification using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted features.

Result: English dominates globally charting K-pop songs with high code-switching; no significant gender differences found, though female solo artists use English more consistently; gender classification achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.76; higher English usage may be more critical for US-focused Hot 100 success.

Conclusion: Linguistic choices in K-pop lyrics are shaped by global market pressures, revealing strategic patterns that reflect performer identity and chart context, with English playing a crucial role in international success.

Abstract: Code switching, particularly between Korean and English, has become a
defining feature of modern K-pop, reflecting both aesthetic choices and global
market strategies. This paper is a primary investigation into the linguistic
strategies employed in K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, with a
focus on the role of code-switching and English lyric usage. A dataset of K-pop
songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts from 2017 to
2025, spanning 14 groups and 8 solo artists, was compiled. Using this dataset,
the proportion of English and Korean lyrics, the frequency of code-switching,
and other stylistic features were analysed. It was found that English dominates
the linguistic landscape of globally charting K-pop songs, with both male and
female performers exhibiting high degrees of code-switching and English usage.
Statistical tests indicated no significant gender-based differences, although
female solo artists tend to favour English more consistently. A classification
task was also performed to predict performer gender from lyrics, achieving
macro F1 scores up to 0.76 using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted
features. Finally, differences between songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the
Global 200 were examined, suggesting that, while there is no significant gender
difference in English, higher English usage may be more critical for success in
the US-focused Hot 100. The findings highlight how linguistic choices in K-pop
lyrics are shaped by global market pressures and reveal stylistic patterns that
reflect performer identity and chart context.

### [44] [Steering Prepositional Phrases in Language Models: A Case of with-headed Adjectival and Adverbial Complements in Gemma-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23204)
*Stefan Arnold,René Gröbner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how language models resolve prepositional phrase ambiguity between instrumental adjuncts and attributive modifiers, finding Gemma-2 has a 3:4 preference for instrumental readings. By manipulating a single attention head's value vector, researchers can shift the distribution between these functional roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms that resolve the split decision between instrumental adjuncts (adverbial verb descriptions) and attributive modifiers (adjectival noun enrichments) in prepositional phrase generation, which remains poorly understood in language models.

Method: Assembled a prompt suite with with-headed prepositional phrases in equally accommodating contexts, projected activations into vocabulary space to identify attention heads, and scaled the value vector of a single attention head to control functional role distribution.

Result: Found a strong 3:4 preference for instrumental readings. By scaling one attention head's value vector, successfully shifted the distribution: instrumental complements attenuated to 33% while attributive complements elevated to 36%.

Conclusion: Individual attention heads play a crucial role in resolving prepositional phrase ambiguity, and targeted intervention on specific heads can effectively control the functional role distribution of prepositional complements in language model generation.

Abstract: Language Models, when generating prepositional phrases, must often decide for
whether their complements functions as an instrumental adjunct (describing the
verb adverbially) or an attributive modifier (enriching the noun adjectivally),
yet the internal mechanisms that resolve this split decision remain poorly
understood. In this study, we conduct a targeted investigation into Gemma-2 to
uncover and control the generation of prepositional complements. We assemble a
prompt suite containing with-headed prepositional phrases whose contexts
equally accommodate either an instrumental or attributive continuation,
revealing a strong preference for an instrumental reading at a ratio of 3:4. To
pinpoint individual attention heads that favor instrumental over attributive
complements, we project activations into the vocabulary space. By scaling the
value vector of a single attention head, we can shift the distribution of
functional roles of complements, attenuating instruments to 33% while elevating
attributes to 36%.

*Huacan Chai,Zijie Cao,Maolin Ran,Yingxuan Yang,Jianghao Lin,pengxin,Hairui Wang,Renjie Ding,Ziyu Wan,Muning Wen,Weiwen Liu,Weinan Zhang,Fei Huang,Ying Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARL-MT introduces progress awareness into LLM training for multi-turn function calling, combining automatic dataset generation with guided reinforcement learning to improve long-horizon task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require multi-turn conversations where LLMs need progress awareness to summarize past interactions and plan future actions, but existing approaches either neglect task-level planning or struggle with redundancy.

Method: PARL-MT framework with Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline for dataset construction and Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm that integrates progress awareness into RL training.

Result: Empirical results on two public benchmarks show PARL-MT significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating effectiveness of progress awareness for robust multi-turn function calling.

Conclusion: Progress awareness is crucial for enabling coherent and efficient multi-turn function calling in LLMs, and PARL-MT provides an effective framework for incorporating this capability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn
function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or
multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In
these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step
but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past
interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task
execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to
isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks
explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness
into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a
Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs
datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a
Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which
integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy
and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT
significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of
progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function
calling.

TL;DR: This paper develops a quantitative framework to evaluate Visual Language Models' ability to generate critiques for traditional Chinese painting using persona-guided prompting and multi-dimensional evaluative features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically test and evaluate current mainstream VLMs' capabilities in generating critiques for traditional Chinese painting, which requires complex semantic understanding and cultural knowledge.

Method: Developed a quantitative framework by extracting multi-dimensional evaluative features from human expert critiques using zero-shot classification, defined critic personas, and employed persona-guided prompting to evaluate VLMs like Llama, Qwen, and Gemini.

Result: Revealed current performance levels, strengths, and areas for improvement of VLMs in art critique, showing their potential and limitations in complex semantic understanding and content generation.

Conclusion: VLMs show promise but have limitations in traditional Chinese painting critique, with the framework providing insights for future improvements in complex semantic understanding tasks.

Abstract: This study aims to test and evaluate the capabilities and characteristics of
current mainstream Visual Language Models (VLMs) in generating critiques for
traditional Chinese painting. To achieve this, we first developed a
quantitative framework for Chinese painting critique. This framework was
constructed by extracting multi-dimensional evaluative features covering
evaluative stance, feature focus, and commentary quality from human expert
critiques using a zero-shot classification model. Based on these features,
several representative critic personas were defined and quantified. This
framework was then employed to evaluate selected VLMs such as Llama, Qwen, or
Gemini. The experimental design involved persona-guided prompting to assess the
VLM's ability to generate critiques from diverse perspectives. Our findings
reveal the current performance levels, strengths, and areas for improvement of
VLMs in the domain of art critique, offering insights into their potential and
limitations in complex semantic understanding and content generation tasks. The

TL;DR: CLAIRE is an agentic system that uses LLM reasoning with retrieval to detect inconsistencies in Wikipedia, helping editors identify contradictions more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikipedia's accuracy is critical as it's widely used for training LLMs and RAG systems. The paper focuses on detecting inconsistencies as a specific type of factual inaccuracy.

Method: Developed CLAIRE - an agentic system combining LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface potentially inconsistent claims with contextual evidence. Also created WIKICOLLIDE benchmark using CLAIRE-assisted human annotation.

Result: 87.5% of Wikipedia editors reported higher confidence using CLAIRE, identifying 64.7% more inconsistencies. Found at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts contradict another fact. Best automated system achieved only 75.1% AUROC on WIKICOLLIDE.

Conclusion: Contradictions are a measurable component of Wikipedia, and LLM-based systems like CLAIRE provide practical tools to help editors improve knowledge consistency at scale.

Abstract: Wikipedia is the largest open knowledge corpus, widely used worldwide and
serving as a key resource for training large language models (LLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Ensuring its accuracy is
therefore critical. But how accurate is Wikipedia, and how can we improve it?
  We focus on inconsistencies, a specific type of factual inaccuracy, and
introduce the task of corpus-level inconsistency detection. We present CLAIRE,
an agentic system that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface
potentially inconsistent claims along with contextual evidence for human
review. In a user study with experienced Wikipedia editors, 87.5% reported
higher confidence when using CLAIRE, and participants identified 64.7% more
inconsistencies in the same amount of time.
  Combining CLAIRE with human annotation, we contribute WIKICOLLIDE, the first
benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies. Using random sampling with
CLAIRE-assisted analysis, we find that at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts
contradict another fact, with inconsistencies propagating into 7.3% of FEVEROUS
and 4.0% of AmbigQA examples. Benchmarking strong baselines on this dataset
reveals substantial headroom: the best fully automated system achieves an AUROC
of only 75.1%.
  Our results show that contradictions are a measurable component of Wikipedia
and that LLM-based systems like CLAIRE can provide a practical tool to help
editors improve knowledge consistency at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-ExBERT is a lightweight framework using domain-adapted BERT with LoRA adapters to extract user intent-relevant sentences from financial service call transcripts, achieving strong performance with efficient fine-tuning on limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial dialogue transcripts present challenges for information extraction due to informal structure, domain-specific vocabulary, and variable intent density, requiring specialized approaches.

Method: Two-stage training with progressive unfreezing: first training classifier head with frozen backbone, then fine-tuning entire model with differential learning rates. Uses dynamic thresholding based on probability curvature instead of fixed cutoffs.

Result: Empirical results show strong precision and F1 performance on real-world transcripts, with interpretable output suitable for downstream workflows.

Conclusion: The framework offers a deployable solution for financial dialogue mining with batched evaluation, visualization, and calibrated export capabilities.

Abstract: Financial dialogue transcripts pose a unique challenge for sentence-level
information extraction due to their informal structure, domain-specific
vocabulary, and variable intent density. We introduce Fin-ExBERT, a lightweight
and modular framework for extracting user intent-relevant sentences from
annotated financial service calls. Our approach builds on a domain-adapted BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) backbone enhanced
with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters, enabling efficient fine-tuning using
limited labeled data. We propose a two-stage training strategy with progressive
unfreezing: initially training a classifier head while freezing the backbone,
followed by gradual fine-tuning of the entire model with differential learning
rates. To ensure robust extraction under uncertainty, we adopt a dynamic
thresholding strategy based on probability curvature (elbow detection),
avoiding fixed cutoff heuristics. Empirical results show strong precision and
F1 performance on real-world transcripts, with interpretable output suitable
for downstream auditing and question-answering workflows. The full framework
supports batched evaluation, visualization, and calibrated export, offering a
deployable solution for financial dialogue mining.

*Wonje Jeung,Sangyeon Yoon,Yoonjun Cho,Dongjae Jeon,Sangwoo Shin,Hyesoo Hong,Albert No*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A2D is a token-level alignment method that defends diffusion LLMs against any-order generation attacks by making them emit [EOS] refusal signals when harmful content appears, achieving near-zero attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion LLMs' any-order generation flexibility enlarges the attack surface, allowing harmful content at arbitrary positions and bypassing response-level refusals through template-based prefilling attacks like DIJA.

Method: A2D aligns dLLMs at token-level under randomized masking to emit [EOS] refusal signals whenever harmful content arises, enabling robustness to any-decoding-order and any-step prefilling attacks.

Result: A2D slashes DIJA success rates from over 80% to near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B) and enables up to 19.3x faster safe termination through thresholded [EOS] probabilities.

Conclusion: Token-level alignment with A2D provides robust defense against any-order attacks in diffusion LLMs while enabling real-time monitoring and early rejection of unsafe content.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this
flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary
positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass
response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a
token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal
whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level
under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order
and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables
real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if
unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents
the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to
near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and
thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x
faster safe termination.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT) are specialized reasoning chains that improve LLMs' policy compliance assessment by providing expert-level reasoning processes, achieving state-of-the-art results on HIPAA and GDPR policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human experts use systematic reasoning for policy compliance assessment, but documenting gold-standard reasoning processes is costly. PRT addresses this by generating reasoning chains to bridge the gap.

Method: Introduces Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT) as specialized generated reasoning chains that serve as a reasoning bridge to enhance LLMs' policy compliance assessment capabilities.

Result: PRTs significantly enhance performance of open-weight and commercial models for both inference-time and training-time scenarios, setting new state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Also improves accurate citation of policy clauses and influences compliance decisions.

Conclusion: PRTs effectively improve LLMs' policy compliance assessment by providing structured reasoning chains, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and better policy clause citation capabilities.

Abstract: Policy compliance assessment is a fundamental task of evaluating whether an
input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, more generally
known as policies. In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step
process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined
in the policy. However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level
reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy
Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that
serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment
capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for
both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the
performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new
state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also
highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy
clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high
utilization from the raw chains of thought.

*Peng Yu,Zeyuan Zhao,Shao Zhang,Luoyi Fu,Xinbing Wang,Ying Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SIE framework automatically creates scalable reasoning environments from structured data, enabling LLMs to learn generalizable reasoning skills that transfer to mathematical and logical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning environments have limitations: mathematical/coding environments don't scale well due to expert annotation requirements, while game-based environments produce overly specialized skills that don't generalize.

Method: SIE framework automatically constructs reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, leveraging rich compositional patterns and explicit schemas for rule-based verification.

Result: SIE achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning and enables learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: SIE provides a scalable framework for developing generalizable reasoning abilities in LLMs, with the additional finding that LLMs can infer missing information in partial environments to achieve robust reasoning improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) via environmental
exploration. As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the
abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL
finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three
core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability.
However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale
due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in
game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap,
we introduce the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{E}nvironment
(SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing
reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich
compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the
explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation
for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not
only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but
also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize
effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We
further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that
LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment,
leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C-Evolve is an evolutionary algorithm that discovers groups of prompts whose aggregated outputs achieve optimal performance through majority voting, outperforming single-prompt evolution methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few works explore whether aggregating results from multiple prompts to reach consensus can further advance AI system capabilities beyond single-prompt evolution for closed-source models.

Method: Uses island-based evolutionary algorithm to maintain population diversity, forms groups from distinct islands, and evaluates prompts based on voting score (contribution within groups) rather than individual performance.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance: 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench with Qwen3-8B (4.95% and 2.73% higher than GEPA), and 47.96% on IFBench and 95.33% on MATH with GPT-4.1-mini.

Conclusion: C-Evolve demonstrates competitive performance by evolving prompts that work well together in groups through consensus, significantly advancing system capability boundaries.

Abstract: Prompt evolution algorithms offer a powerful paradigm for enhancing AI
systems based on closed-source models, while few work explores whether
aggregating results from multiple prompts to reach a consensus can further
advance the system capability boundary. In this paper, we introduce
Consensus-Evolve (C-Evolve), an evolutionary algorithm that discovers a group
of prompts whose aggregated outputs after majority voting achieve optimal
performance. More specifically, C-Evolve employs an island-based evolutionary
algorithm to maintain population diversity, and prompts from distinct islands
are selected to form groups to aggregate their outputs. The key difference from
single individual evolution is a voting score, which evaluates each individual
prompt's contribution within groups. We take this as the fitness score for
evolution instead of individual performance. Consequently, C-Evolve is more
likely to produce and maintain prompts with higher potential to form a
high-performing group and eliminate low-performing ones, gradually improving
the group performance after reaching consensus. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks, including both
open-ended tasks like HotpotQA and closed-ended tasks like MATH. On Qwen3-8B,
C-Evolve achieves 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench, which are 4.95% and
2.73% higher than GEPA, respectively. For GPT-4.1-mini, the accuracy on IFBench
is further improved to 47.96% and reaches 95.33% in the MATH benchmark. These
results demonstrate the C-Evolve's competitive performance.

*Han Yan,Zheyuan Liu,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM is a unified machine unlearning framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in representation and parameter spaces to address catastrophic forgetting, metric imbalance, and vulnerability to relearn/jailbreak attacks in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing concerns around user privacy, copyright infringement, and safety in large language models by overcoming limitations of current unlearning methods that suffer from catastrophic forgetting, metric imbalance, and vulnerability to attacks.

Method: PRISM enforces dual-space smoothness through two stages: (1) representation space stage using robustly trained probes to defend against jailbreak attacks, and (2) parameter-space stage that decouples retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths parameter space to mitigate relearning attacks.

Result: Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings show PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under multiple attacks while achieving better balance among key unlearning metrics.

Conclusion: PRISM provides an effective unified framework for robust machine unlearning that addresses critical limitations of existing methods and demonstrates superior performance across various attack scenarios and text generation settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, Machine Unlearning has
emerged to address growing concerns around user privacy, copyright
infringement, and overall safety. Yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning
methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for
example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness,
utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In
addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be
exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks. To address these challenges, we
propose PRISM, a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in
representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance
unlearning metrics. PRISM consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a
representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend
against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples
retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter
space to mitigate relearning attacks. Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE,
across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, show that PRISM
outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better
balance among key metrics.

*Xinchun Su,Chunxu Luo,Yixuan Li,Weidong Yang,Lipeng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedCritical is a novel two-stage framework that enables small language models to achieve complex medical reasoning through self-iteration collaboration and direct preference optimization, outperforming existing 7B models on medical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models underperform in complex medical reasoning tasks compared to large models, and traditional knowledge distillation methods are costly and inefficient. The goal is to develop a more efficient approach for enhancing small models' medical reasoning capabilities.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Extract long-chain thought templates from teacher model to guide student model, 2) Use direct preference optimization through model self-iteration collaboration where the student model plays against its own correction trajectory to enhance reasoning ability.

Result: MedCritical 7B model outperforms Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04% and 10.12% respectively on CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among 7B-class small models with lower cost than traditional knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: The proposed self-learning DPO approach enables small models to achieve comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation at lower cost, demonstrating that model self-iteration collaboration can effectively enhance complex reasoning abilities in medical domains.

Abstract: In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant
challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large
language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based
methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction,
but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and
efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework,
MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher
model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and
detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the
student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage,
we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration
collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing
against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This
model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own
error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex
problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation
methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model
outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\%
respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among
7B-class small models.

*Junming Yang,Ning Xu,Biao Liu,Shiqi Qiao,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaAPO is a novel framework that dynamically couples data generation with model training using a meta-learner to bridge the distribution gap between offline preference data and evolving model policies, achieving superior performance with reduced annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the evolving model policy in LLM alignment, which existing methods fail to adapt to the model's dynamic learning state.

Method: Employs a lightweight meta-learner as an "alignment gap estimator" to evaluate benefits of on-policy sampling, guiding targeted online generation and assigning sample-wise meta-weights to balance quality and distribution of online and offline data.

Result: Outperforms existing preference optimization approaches on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench across various settings while reducing 42% in online annotation costs.

Conclusion: MetaAPO effectively bridges the distribution gap in preference optimization through dynamic coupling of data generation and model training, achieving better alignment with reduced costs.

Abstract: Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is
the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the
evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static
heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to
adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose
Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework
that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a
lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the
potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This
guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the
optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of
online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench
demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference
optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online
annotation costs.

*Xi Zhang,Zaiqiao Meng,Jake Lever,Edmond S. L. Ho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CCD is a training-free framework that reduces medical hallucinations in radiology MLLMs by using clinical contrastive decoding with expert model signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs in radiology often generate clinically unsupported descriptions (medical hallucinations) due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections, posing serious risks in medical applications.

Method: Clinical Contrastive Decoding (CCD) - a training-free, retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from radiology expert models using dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation.

Result: CCD consistently improves performance on radiology report generation across three datasets and multiple models, achieving up to 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 on MIMIC-CXR dataset with state-of-the-art RRG models.

Conclusion: CCD provides a lightweight, generalizable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations by effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology without modifying base models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language
understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported
descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in
medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through
empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent
in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To
address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free
and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical
signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage
contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby
enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on
three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves
overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR
dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to
state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and
generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively
bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

*Wonhyuk Lee,Youngchol Kim,Yunjin Park,Junhyung Moon,Dongyoung Jeong,Wanjin Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Guard Vector is a safety task vector that enables safety classification improvements and multilingual extensibility without additional training by composing with target language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient and portable safety mechanism for language models that works across different architectures and languages without requiring additional training data.

Method: Compute Guard Vector as parameter difference between guardrail and pretrained models, compose with target models, use prefix-based training with single-token classifier output for streaming awareness.

Result: Improves classification quality across safety suites, enables Chinese/Japanese/Korean extensibility without additional training, maintains quality under streaming, increases throughput and reduces latency.

Conclusion: Guard Vector provides an efficient, portable safety solution that reduces compute requirements while promoting responsible AI practices through streaming-aware evaluation.

Abstract: We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter
difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture
pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model
yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware
approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier
that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves
classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety
suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean,
requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also
demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail
backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM
preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior
between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design
increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce
data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation
practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.

*Sebastian Bordt,Martin Pawelczyk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes running multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously in a single training run to reduce computational costs, demonstrating feasibility with 10 experiments on a 1.5B parameter model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the significant computational cost constraint of pretraining experiments for understanding LLM behavior, enabling more rigorous scientific experimentation with limited compute budget.

Method: Conduct multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run, testing with 10 experiments on a 1.5B parameter model trained on 210B tokens, and using continual pretraining to test for interactions.

Result: Successfully replicated previous works on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization, and conducted novel investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and watermarking with minimal impact on training dynamics and overall performance.

Conclusion: Multiple pretraining experiments can be conducted simultaneously in a single training run, enabling cost-effective scientific experimentation with large models while maintaining research validity.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that controlled pretraining experiments are a
powerful tool for understanding learning, reasoning, and memorization in large
language models (LLMs). However, the computational cost of pretraining presents
a significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct
multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run.
We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments
during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only
train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works
on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel
investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and
watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the
model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of
the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is
minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a
potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with
continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup.
Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments
in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with
large models on a compute budget.

*Wenhang Shi,Yiren Chen,Shuqing Bian,Xinyi Zhang,Kai Tang,Pengfei Hu,Zhe Zhao,Wei Lu,Xiaoyong Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRACE is an efficient prompt optimization framework that uses gated refinement and adaptive compression strategies to overcome local optima and generate stable, improved prompts with only 25% of the computational budget of prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic prompt optimization struggles with stable prompt generation, low efficiency, and getting trapped in local optima, while manual design is costly and not scalable.

Method: GRACE integrates two strategies: (1) Gated refinement with feedback regulation and update rejection gates to refine update signals, and (2) Adaptive compression that distills core concepts when optimization stagnates to restructure the optimization trace.

Result: On 11 tasks across BIG-Bench Hard, domain-specific, and general NLP tasks, GRACE achieved average relative improvements of 4.7%, 4.4%, and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, using only 25% of the prompt generation budget.

Conclusion: GRACE delivers substantial performance and efficiency gains through strategic information loss via refinement and compression, making it a highly efficient prompt optimization framework.

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging the full potential of large
language models (LLMs). While automatic prompt optimization offers a scalable
alternative to costly manual design, generating effective prompts remains
challenging. Existing methods often struggle to stably generate improved
prompts, leading to low efficiency, and overlook that prompt optimization
easily gets trapped in local optima. Addressing this, we propose GRACE, a
framework that integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and
Adaptive Compression, achieving Efficient prompt optimization. The gated
refinement strategy introduces a feedback regulation gate and an update
rejection gate, which refine update signals to produce stable and effective
prompt improvements. When optimization stagnates, the adaptive compression
strategy distills the prompt's core concepts, restructuring the optimization
trace and opening new paths. By strategically introducing information loss
through refinement and compression, GRACE delivers substantial gains in
performance and efficiency. In extensive experiments on 11 tasks across three
practical domains, including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), domain-specific, and general
NLP tasks, GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements
of 4.7%, 4.4% and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Further
analysis shows that GRACE achieves these gains using only 25% of the prompt
generation budget required by prior methods, highlighting its high optimization
efficiency and low computational overhead. Our code is available at

*Sherrie Shen,Weixuan Wang,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces paratextual explicitation for machine translation, using footnotes/endnotes to explain culture-bound terms. It evaluates LLMs on this task using a dataset from Chinese-to-English translations, finding LLMs improve comprehension but lag behind human translators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MT struggles with culture-bound terms that resist direct translation. Existing approaches focus only on in-text solutions, ignoring the paratextual apparatus (footnotes/endnotes) used by professional translators.

Method: Formalized Genette's theory of paratexts, constructed a dataset of 560 expert-aligned paratexts from English translations of Liaozhai, and evaluated LLMs with/without reasoning traces on explicitation choice and content using intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods.

Result: LLM-generated paratexts improve audience comprehension but are significantly less effective than translator-authored ones. Statistical analysis shows wide variation in professional translators' paratext usage, indicating cultural mediation is open-ended rather than prescriptive.

Conclusion: Paratextual explicitation has potential to advance MT beyond linguistic equivalence, with extensions to monolingual explanation and personalized adaptation. The task is challenging but demonstrates the value of incorporating translation studies insights into MT systems.

Abstract: The faithful transfer of contextually-embedded meaning continues to challenge
contemporary machine translation (MT), particularly in the rendering of
culture-bound terms--expressions or concepts rooted in specific languages or
cultures, resisting direct linguistic transfer. Existing computational
approaches to explicitating these terms have focused exclusively on in-text
solutions, overlooking paratextual apparatus in the footnotes and endnotes
employed by professional translators. In this paper, we formalize Genette's
(1987) theory of paratexts from literary and translation studies to introduce
the task of paratextual explicitation for MT. We construct a dataset of 560
expert-aligned paratexts from four English translations of the classical
Chinese short story collection Liaozhai and evaluate LLMs with and without
reasoning traces on choice and content of explicitation. Experiments across
intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods establish the difficulty of
this task, with human evaluation showing that LLM-generated paratexts improve
audience comprehension, though remain considerably less effective than
translator-authored ones. Beyond model performance, statistical analysis
reveals that even professional translators vary widely in their use of
paratexts, suggesting that cultural mediation is inherently open-ended rather
than prescriptive. Our findings demonstrate the potential of paratextual
explicitation in advancing MT beyond linguistic equivalence, with promising
extensions to monolingual explanation and personalized adaptation.

*Haowei Hua,Hong Jiao,Dan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study compares human and LLM (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude) rationales in automated essay scoring to understand scoring inconsistencies and reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reasoning behind scoring inconsistencies between human and LLM raters by analyzing their rationales, leveraging LLMs' ability to provide scoring justifications.

Method: Used essays from large-scale tests, evaluated LLM scoring accuracy with quadratic weighted kappa and normalized mutual information, analyzed rationale similarity with cosine similarity, and explored clustering patterns using PCA on rationale embeddings.

Result: The study provides insights into LLM scoring accuracy and "thinking" patterns, revealing similarities and differences in rationale patterns between human and automated scoring.

Conclusion: Analysis of rationales helps improve understanding of reasoning processes in both human scoring and LLM-based automated scoring, contributing to better automated scoring systems.

Abstract: Advances in automated scoring are closely aligned with advances in
machine-learning and natural-language-processing techniques. With recent
progress in large language models (LLMs), the use of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude,
and other generative-AI chatbots for automated scoring has been explored. Given
their strong reasoning capabilities, LLMs can also produce rationales to
support the scores they assign. Thus, evaluating the rationales provided by
both human and LLM raters can help improve the understanding of the reasoning
that each type of rater applies when assigning a score. This study investigates
the rationales of human and LLM raters to identify potential causes of scoring
inconsistency. Using essays from a large-scale test, the scoring accuracy of
GPT-4o, Gemini, and other LLMs is examined based on quadratic weighted kappa
and normalized mutual information. Cosine similarity is used to evaluate the
similarity of the rationales provided. In addition, clustering patterns in
rationales are explored using principal component analysis based on the
embeddings of the rationales. The findings of this study provide insights into
the accuracy and ``thinking'' of LLMs in automated scoring, helping to improve
the understanding of the rationales behind both human scoring and LLM-based
automated scoring.

TL;DR: RCD decoding strategy improves LM factual knowledge evaluation by constraining outputs to unique surface forms, showing standard decoding underestimates model knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluation methods dismiss correct answers expressed in alternative surface forms, leading to underestimation of language models' parametric knowledge.

Method: Proposed Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD) that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms, and introduced YAGO-QA dataset with 19,137 general knowledge questions.

Result: Llama-3.1-70B scored 32.3% F1 with vanilla decoding vs 46.0% with RCD; Llama-3.1-8B reached 33.0% with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding.

Conclusion: Standard decoding undervalues language models' knowledge, and RCD provides a more accurate assessment of their factual knowledge capabilities.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, but often produce
answers judged as incorrect. We hypothesize that many of these answers are
actually correct, but are expressed in alternative surface forms that are
dismissed due to an overly strict evaluation, leading to an underestimation of
models' parametric knowledge. We propose Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD),
a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. We
introduce YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions. Evaluating
open-source LMs from 135M to 70B parameters, we show that standard decoding
undervalues their knowledge. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B scores only 32.3% F1
with vanilla decoding but 46.0% with RCD. Similarly, Llama-3.1-8B reaches 33.0%
with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding. We publicly
share the code and dataset at https://github.com/Rajjaa/disambiguated-LLM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CooT is a decoding-time framework that adds explicit cognitive self-monitoring to LLMs, using a Perceiver module to detect misalignments during generation and intervene with rollback and regeneration under safety guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment strategies embed safety into model weights, making controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify. There's a need for more explicit, dynamic, and auditable safety mechanisms.

Method: CooT couples a text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that monitors generation using a structured hierarchy of principles. When violations are detected, it rolls back generation and regenerates with injected safety guidance combining universal social priors and context-specific warnings.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

Conclusion: CooT transforms alignment from a fixed property into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process during inference, enabling flexible policy updates without model retraining.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit
harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into
model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify.
This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time
framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop.
CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that
continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured,
precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to
detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT
intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and
regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with
context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property
into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference,
allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT
consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

TL;DR: This paper reviews 37 studies on automated item difficulty prediction using text-based machine learning approaches, showing that transformer-based language models can effectively predict item difficulty without manual feature engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional item difficulty modeling methods (field testing, CTT, IRT) are time-consuming and costly. Text-based ML approaches offer promising alternatives for large-scale assessments.

Method: Systematic review of 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction, analyzing datasets, difficulty parameters, subject domains, item types, data splits, features, models, and evaluation criteria.

Result: State-of-the-art language models (including transformers) can capture syntactic and semantic patterns effectively. Best performance achieved: RMSE 0.165, Pearson correlation 0.87, accuracy 0.806. Classic ML models remain relevant for interpretability.

Conclusion: Text-based methods show strong potential for automated item difficulty prediction. The review provides benchmarks for future research and discusses practical implications and future directions.

Abstract: Item difficulty plays a crucial role in test performance, interpretability of
scores, and equity for all test-takers, especially in large-scale assessments.
Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and
classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT)
calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language
models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and
synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale
assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate
the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items,
training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and
model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine
learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art
language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures,
can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature
engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a
benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the
potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low
as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806.
The review concludes by discussing implications for practice and outlining
future research directions for automated item difficulty modeling.

*Dania Refai,Alaa Dalaq,Doaa Dalaq,Irfan Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Active learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis using LLM-assisted labeling achieves competitive performance with reduced annotation costs compared to human labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited progress in Arabic sentiment analysis due to lack of large labeled datasets, with few studies exploring active learning and LLM-assisted annotation in Arabic context.

Method: Proposed active learning framework evaluated multiple deep learning architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) across three Arabic datasets, comparing human labeling vs LLM-assisted labeling using five LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, LLaMA 3 70B).

Result: LLM-assisted active learning achieved competitive or superior performance: LSTM with GPT-4o reached 93% accuracy on Hunger Station with 450 samples, DeepSeek Chat reached 82% accuracy on MASAC with 650 samples, matching human labeling performance.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted active learning is effective for Arabic sentiment analysis, reducing annotation costs while maintaining high accuracy across different Arabic datasets and dialects.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, plays a
vital role in areas like marketing, customer service, and social media
monitoring by providing insights into user opinions and emotions. However,
progress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large,
high-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in
reducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in
Arabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for
assisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still
largely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active
learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation
costs while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning
architectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent
units (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark
datasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard
Arabic and dialectal variations. Additionally, two annotation strategies are
compared: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling. Five LLMs are evaluated as
annotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3
70B Instruct. For each dataset, the best-performing LLM was used: GPT-4o for
Hunger Station, Claude 3 Sonnet for AJGT, and DeepSeek Chat for MASAC. Our
results show that LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station
dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples
using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat
reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained
through human labeling.

### [68] [On the Shelf Life of Fine-Tuned LLM Judges: Future Proofing, Backward Compatibility, and Question Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23542)
*Janvijay Singh,Austin Xu,Yilun Zhou,Yefan Zhou,Dilek Hakkani-Tur,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the practical deployment concerns of finetuned LLM judges, focusing on future-proofing, backward compatibility, and question generalization in the math domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluation ignores practical deployment concerns of finetuned judges, particularly their shelf life when dealing with evolving generator models and unseen questions.

Method: Study three aspects under unified framework with varying train/test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms, and three base models in math domain.

Result: Future-proofing is challenging, backward compatibility is easier with DPO-trained models improving performance, continual learning provides balanced adaptation, and all models show performance degradation on unseen questions.

Conclusion: Current judges don't fully generalize to unseen questions, and practical considerations are needed for deploying judge models with changing generators.

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model
responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently,
finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred
choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former
achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to
common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical
concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this
paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of
these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges
finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by
future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well
judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three
aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and
test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three
different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging
for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with
DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that
continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older
and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker
responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance
degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,
showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These
findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and
deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.

### [70] [Towards Efficient CoT Distillation: Self-Guided Rationale Selector for Better Performance with Fewer Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23574)
*Jianzhi Yan,Le Liu,Youcheng Pan,Shiwei Chen,Yang Xiang,Buzhou Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoRSD is a method that selects high-quality rationales for chain-of-thought distillation to improve small language models' reasoning, achieving 4.6% average improvement on seven datasets using fewer but better rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT distillation methods focus on data quantity rather than rationale quality, potentially transferring noisy or incorrect information to student models.

Method: Proposed Model-Oriented Rationale Selection Distillation (MoRSD) with Rationale Difficulty metric to select high-quality rationales based on accuracy, diversity, and difficulty.

Result: Achieved 4.6% average improvement on seven datasets across three tasks using fewer rationales, showing that high-quality rationales are more effective than large quantities.

Conclusion: A small portion of high-quality rationales can better enhance student models' reasoning than the entire dataset, providing an efficient solution for CoT distillation.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation aims to enhance small language models'
(SLMs) reasoning by transferring multi-step reasoning capability from the
larger teacher models. However, existing work underestimates rationale quality,
focusing primarily on data quantity, which may transfer noisy or incorrect
information to the student model. To address the above issues, we proposed
\textbf{M}odel-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}ationale \textbf{S}election
\textbf{D}istillation (MoRSD), which can discern and select high quality
rationales for distillation to improve performance further. We further propose
a Rationale Difficulty (RD) metric to measure the ability of the student model
to generate the correct answer under a given rationale. Compared to the
baseline, we achieved 4.6$\%$ average improvement on seven datasets over three
tasks, using fewer rationales by controlling their accuracy, diversity, and
difficulty. Our results reveal that a small portion of the high quality
rationales can enhance the reasoning ability of student models than the entire
dataset. Our method promises to be a possible solution for efficient CoT
distillation. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MoRSD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Jackal is a large-scale text-to-JQL benchmark with 100,000 natural language to JQL query pairs, featuring execution-based evaluation on real Jira data with 200,000+ issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no open, real-world, execution-based benchmark for mapping natural language queries to Jira Query Language (JQL), which enterprise teams rely on for issue retrieval.

Method: Created Jackal benchmark with 100,000 NL-to-JQL pairs across four user request types: Long NL, Short NL, Semantically Similar, and Semantically Exact. Evaluated 23 LLMs using execution accuracy, exact match, and canonical exact match metrics.

Result: On Jackal-5K subset, best model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieved only 60.3% execution accuracy overall. Performance varied significantly by request type: Long NL (86.0%), Short NL (35.7%), Semantically Similar (22.7%), and Semantically Exact (99.3%).

Conclusion: Jackal exposes limitations of current LLMs in text-to-JQL translation and sets a new execution-based challenge for enterprise data research, showing significant room for improvement especially on short and semantically similar queries.

Abstract: Enterprise teams rely on the Jira Query Language (JQL) to retrieve and filter
issues from Jira. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no open, real-world,
execution-based benchmark for mapping natural language queries to JQL. We
introduce Jackal, a novel, large-scale text-to-JQL benchmark comprising 100,000
natural language (NL) requests paired with validated JQL queries and
execution-based results on a live Jira instance with over 200,000 issues. To
reflect real-world usage, each JQL query is associated with four types of user
requests: (i) Long NL, (ii) Short NL, (iii) Semantically Similar, and (iv)
Semantically Exact. We release Jackal, a corpus of 100,000 text-to-JQL pairs,
together with an execution-based scoring toolkit, and a static snapshot of the
evaluated Jira instance for reproducibility. We report text-to-JQL results on
23 Large Language Models (LLMs) spanning parameter sizes, open and closed
source models, across execution accuracy, exact match, and canonical exact
match. In this paper, we report results on Jackal-5K, a 5,000-pair subset of
Jackal. On Jackal-5K, the best overall model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieves only
60.3% execution accuracy averaged equally across four user request types.
Performance varies significantly across user request types: (i) Long NL
(86.0%), (ii) Short NL (35.7%), (iii) Semantically Similar (22.7%), and (iv)
Semantically Exact (99.3%). By benchmarking LLMs on their ability to produce
correct and executable JQL queries, Jackal exposes the limitations of current
state-of-the-art LLMs and sets a new, execution-based challenge for future
research in Jira enterprise data.

*JinXin Li,Gang Tu,JunJie Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSAD: A hallucination detection method using frequency-domain analysis of hidden layer temporal signals to identify reasoning anomalies in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods are limited by knowledge coverage constraints and inability to capture reasoning biases during inference. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience signal analysis.

Method: Model LLM reasoning as temporal cognitive journey, apply Fast Fourier Transform to hidden layer signals to create spectral features, design detection algorithm based on these features.

Result: HSAD overcomes limitations of existing approaches, demonstrates higher detection accuracy and robustness by capturing reasoning process anomalies.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain analysis of hidden layer signals effectively detects hallucinations, providing better solution than factual consistency verification or static feature methods.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a
wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the
frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become
a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios.
Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency
verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the
scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning
biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by
signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a
hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden
layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal
\textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's
reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose
modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and
discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal
signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal
signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are
used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis
experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this
approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on
these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By
effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with
frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations
of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of
reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.

*Taiqiang Wu,Runming Yang,Tao Liu,Jiahao Wang,Zenan Xu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Timber is a training-free method that enhances exploration capability of Instruct models by partially reverting them towards Base models through targeted refinement of weight deltas, improving Pass@k performance without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training from Base to Instruct models is considered superficial, improving exploitation but limiting exploration capabilities, creating a critical trade-off that needs to be addressed.

Method: Timber partially reverts Instruct models towards their paired Base models by performing subtle, targeted refinement of the weight deltas between Base and Instruct models, without requiring additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series show Timber consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly enhancing Pass@k performance while preserving exploitation capabilities.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into post-training at the weight level and practical strategies to refine Instruct models without training, successfully addressing the exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Abstract: Post-training, which elicits a pretrained Base model into the corresponding
Instruct model, is widely considered to be superficial. In this work, we first
reinforce this hypothesis by providing novel quantitative evidence from the
weight level that the effective rank (eRank) remains negligibly changed.
However, this superficiality also suffers a critical trade-off, improving the
exploitation capabilities at the cost of limiting its exploration. To tackle
this issue, we propose Timber, a simple yet effective training-free method that
enhances the exploration capability of the Instruct model while preserving its
exploitation. The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the
paired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas.
Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber
consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k
performance. Our findings offer new insights into the post-training stage at
the weight level and practical strategies to refine the Instruct model without
training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework using latent codebooks for fast reasoning that replaces explicit CoT tokens with distilled strategy vectors, reducing inference cost while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CoT reasoning is inefficient due to long reasoning traces that increase latency and token usage, despite enhancing performance on complex tasks.

Method: Uses concise CoT sketches during training to learn discrete strategy priors in codebooks, then conditions on distilled continuous thinking vectors at inference. Includes GainRouter for adaptive switching between fast codebook inference and slow explicit reasoning.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior accuracy across multiple reasoning benchmarks while substantially lowering inference cost.

Conclusion: Provides a practical path toward efficient and controllable reasoning in large language models by suppressing overthinking and reducing unnecessary token generation.

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on generating
explicit tokens step by step, and their effectiveness typically hinges on
large-scale supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques substantially enhance performance on complex
reasoning tasks, they remain inefficient, requiring long reasoning traces that
increase latency and token usage. In this work, we introduce Latent Codebooks
for Fast Thinking, a framework that uses concise CoT sketches only during
training to learn a codebook of discrete strategy priors. At inference, the
model conditions on a handful of continuous thinking vectors distilled from the
codebook in a single pass, enabling strategy-level guidance without producing
explicit reasoning tokens. To complement this design, we propose GainRouter, a
lightweight routing mechanism that adaptively switches between fast codebook
guided inference and slow explicit reasoning, thereby suppressing overthinking
and reducing unnecessary token generation. Experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while substantially lowering inference cost, offering a practical path
toward efficient and controllable reasoning in large language models.

*Zemin Huang,Yuhang Wang,Zhiyang Chen,Guo-Jun Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RemeDi introduces remasking as a fundamental mechanism in mask-based diffusion language models, enabling flexible text refinement by identifying and resampling low-quality tokens through joint prediction of token distributions and confidence scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models struggle to revise incorrect tokens once generated, with the key challenge being identification of potential errors in inputs.

Method: Proposes RemeDi with remasking mechanism that jointly predicts token distributions and per-token confidence scores. Uses remask-aware training pipeline including supervised fine-tuning to detect/remask incorrect tokens and reinforcement learning to optimize generation trajectories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source Diffusion Language Models on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: RemeDi successfully addresses the limitation of fixed tokens in mask-based DLMs through remasking, enabling more flexible and effective text refinement.

Abstract: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) struggle to revise incorrect
tokens: once a token is generated, it typically remains fixed. The key
challenge is to identify potential errors in the inputs. In this paper, we
propose \emph{\underline{Rem}asking-\underline{e}nabled \underline{Di}ffusion
Language Model (RemeDi}, a mask-based DLM that introduces \emph{remasking} as
another fundamental mechanism, enabling more flexible text refinement in
diffusion-based text generation. To achieve this, RemeDi jointly predicts token
distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step. The confidence
scores determine which tokens to be unmasked after the current step, allowing
the model to identify tokens with low quality and remask them. These remasked
tokens can be resampled with richer context in subsequent steps. We design a
remask-aware pipeline to train this ability, including supervised fine-tuning
which teaches the model to detect and remask incorrect tokens in addition to
predict mask tokens, and reinforcement learning which optimizes full generation
trajectories toward higher rewards. Experiments show that RemeDi achieves the
state-of-the-art results among open-source DLMs on multiple datasets.

TL;DR: RL outperforms SFT in cross-lingual reasoning generalization, with RL-trained models achieving higher accuracy and better generalization across languages, especially when trained on non-English data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of reinforcement learning versus supervised fine-tuning on cross-lingual reasoning generalization in LLMs, which remains unexplored despite RL's superior performance in complex reasoning.

Method: Systematic investigation using Qwen2.5-3B-Base model on diverse multilingual reasoning benchmarks (math, commonsense, scientific reasoning) with comparative analysis of RL and SFT approaches.

Result: RL achieves higher accuracy and substantially stronger cross-lingual generalization than SFT. RL training on non-English data yields better overall performance and generalization than English data training, unlike SFT.

Conclusion: RL enables more robust reasoning strategies and provides crucial guidance for equitable and effective multilingual reasoning, with compelling evidence of RL's superiority in cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: Enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
attracts widespread attention. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
superior performance for improving complex reasoning, its impact on
cross-lingual generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) remains
unexplored. We present the first systematic investigation into cross-lingual
reasoning generalization of RL and SFT. Using Qwen2.5-3B-Base as our foundation
model, we conduct experiments on diverse multilingual reasoning benchmarks,
including math reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Our
investigation yields two significant findings: (1) Tuning with RL not only
achieves higher accuracy but also demonstrates substantially stronger
cross-lingual generalization capabilities compared to SFT. (2) RL training on
non-English data yields better overall performance and generalization than
training on English data, which is not observed with SFT. Furthermore, through
comprehensive mechanistic analyses, we explore the underlying factors of RL's
superiority and generalization across languages. Our results provide compelling
evidence that RL enables the model with more robust reasoning strategies,
offering crucial guidance for more equitable and effective multilingual
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for code reasoning lack formal deductive frameworks and cannot assess whether models genuinely reason about program semantics or just exploit superficial associations between natural language and code tokens.

Method: Introduces TF-Bench based on type inference in System F, with verified transformations to remove semantically irrelevant natural language creating TF-Bench_pure, a purely semantics-driven variant.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show substantial limitations, with Claude-3.7-sonnet achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure. Two novel metrics reveal critical limitations in robustness and test-time reasoning effectiveness.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant gaps in program semantics reasoning capabilities, highlighting essential directions for future research in developing more robust reasoning models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software
engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities
show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond
mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a
formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are
incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics
or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code
tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to
as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove
semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely
semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial
limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM
(Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure.
Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the
effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in
current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future
research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results for embodied

Action Justification, and (3) Reflective Reasoning. Together, these dimensions
provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to perceive,
reason, and act in socially meaningful ways. We evaluate the latest commercial

TL;DR: M-Hyper is a novel multi-modal knowledge graph completion method that combines fusion-based and ensemble-based approaches using quaternion algebra to represent multiple modalities and model their interactions effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMKGC methods have limitations: fusion-based methods lose modality-specific information and lack flexibility, while ensemble-based methods fail to capture nuanced cross-modal semantic interactions.

Method: Uses quaternion algebra with four orthogonal bases to represent independent modalities and Hamilton product for modality interactions. Includes Fine-grained Entity Representation Factorization (FERF) and Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF) modules to obtain robust representations for three independent modalities and one fused modality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrates robustness, and maintains computational efficiency in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: M-Hyper successfully integrates the strengths of both fusion-based and ensemble-based paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal interactions while preserving modality-specific information through its innovative quaternion-based approach.

Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover missing facts
in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging both structural
relationships and diverse modality information of entities. Existing MMKGC
methods follow two multi-modal paradigms: fusion-based and ensemble-based.
Fusion-based methods employ fixed fusion strategies, which inevitably leads to
the loss of modality-specific information and a lack of flexibility to adapt to
varying modality relevance across contexts. In contrast, ensemble-based methods
retain modality independence through dedicated sub-models but struggle to
capture the nuanced, context-dependent semantic interplay between modalities.
To overcome these dual limitations, we propose a novel MMKGC method M-Hyper,
which achieves the coexistence and collaboration of fused and independent
modality representations. Our method integrates the strengths of both
paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal interactions while maintaining
modality-specific information. Inspired by ``quaternion'' algebra, we utilize
its four orthogonal bases to represent multiple independent modalities and
employ the Hamilton product to efficiently model pair-wise interactions among
them. Specifically, we introduce a Fine-grained Entity Representation
Factorization (FERF) module and a Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF)
module to obtain robust representations for three independent modalities and
one fused modality. The resulting four modality representations are then mapped
to the four orthogonal bases of a biquaternion (a hypercomplex extension of
quaternion) for comprehensive modality interaction. Extensive experiments
indicate its state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and computational
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure drivers master traffic rules for road safety by evaluating LLMs on Romanian driving-law QA with explanation generation.

Method: Created a 1,208-question dataset (387 multimodal), compared text-only and multimodal SOTA systems, fine-tuned Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct and RoLlama 3.1-8B-Instruct, and used LLM-as-a-Judge for explanation quality assessment.

Result: SOTA models perform well but fine-tuned 8B models are competitive. Textual descriptions of images outperform direct visual input. LLM-as-a-Judge reveals self-preference bias in explanation evaluation.

Conclusion: The study informs explainable QA for less-resourced languages, showing the effectiveness of fine-tuned smaller models and the superiority of text over visual inputs for this domain.

Abstract: Ensuring that both new and experienced drivers master current traffic rules
is critical to road safety. This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs)
on Romanian driving-law QA with explanation generation. We release a
1{,}208-question dataset (387 multimodal) and compare text-only and multimodal
SOTA systems, then measure the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning for Llama
3.1-8B-Instruct and RoLlama 3.1-8B-Instruct. SOTA models perform well, but
fine-tuned 8B models are competitive. Textual descriptions of images outperform
direct visual input. Finally, an LLM-as-a-Judge assesses explanation quality,
revealing self-preference bias. The study informs explainable QA for
less-resourced languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal reasoning performance depends on how facts are distributed across modalities - additional modalities help only when providing independent reasoning paths, but often hurt performance due to integration failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistent reports on whether added modalities help or harm reasoning in MLLMs, and understand when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning.

Method: Logic-grounded evaluation framework categorizing multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, analyzing attention patterns, and testing two-step prompting (recognize then reason) and early fusion modifications.

Result: Additional modalities enhance reasoning only when providing independent sufficient paths; redundant/chained support often hurts performance. Three degradation patterns identified: weaker modalities drag performance, conflicts bias preferences, joint signals fail integration. Two-step prompting restores performance, confirming task-composition bottleneck.

Conclusion: Integration, not perception, is the main barrier to multimodal reasoning. Composition-aware training and early fusion control are promising directions to address task-composition and fusion bottlenecks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise enhanced reasoning by
integrating diverse inputs such as text, vision, and audio. Yet cross-modal
reasoning remains underexplored, with conflicting reports on whether added
modalities help or harm performance. These inconsistencies stem from a lack of
controlled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate
when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address
this gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes
multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are
distributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional
modalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient
reasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts
performance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker
modalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward
certain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be
integrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures:
task-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly
executed in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces
bias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode
fact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason)
restores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck. Moreover,
modality identity remains recoverable in early layers, and softening attention
in early fusion improves reasoning, highlighting biased fusion as another
failure mode. Overall, our findings show that integration, not perception, is
the main barrier to multimodal reasoning, suggesting composition-aware training
and early fusion control as promising directions.

*Chao Wang,Rui-Chen Zheng,Yang Ai,Zhen-Hua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech integration in LLMs degrades textual competence due to parameter importance distribution shift during fine-tuning. Layer-wise learning rate scheduling and LoRA help preserve textual knowledge while improving speech performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech-enabled LLMs experience degradation in their core textual competence, limiting their ability to leverage pre-trained text knowledge effectively.

Method: Proposed analytical framework using parameter importance estimation to identify textual importance distribution shift. Investigated layer-wise learning rate scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to preserve original parameter distribution.

Result: Both mitigation strategies better maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning while improving downstream spoken question answering performance.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of these strategies is linked to the structural properties of textual knowledge in LLMs, providing a principled explanation for their benefits.

Abstract: The integration of speech into Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially
expanded their capabilities, but often at the cost of weakening their core
textual competence. This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs
to fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we
analyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the
widely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based
on parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech
introduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation
of parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this
insight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate
scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original
parameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better
maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving
downstream spoken question answering performance. Furthermore, our analysis
offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed
mitigation strategies, linking their benefits to the structural properties of
textual knowledge in LLMs.

*Junliang Li,Yucheng Wang,Yan Chen,Yu Ran,Ruiqing Zhang,Jing Liu,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KLCF is a reinforcement learning framework that addresses LLM hallucinations by ensuring knowledge consistency between policy and base models through dual-fact alignment, improving factual recall and precision without external knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination and factuality deficits in LLMs during long-form generation remain major reliability obstacles, with existing RLHF methods often ignoring internal knowledge boundaries and exacerbating the 'hallucination tax'.

Method: KLCF uses pretrained knowledge boundaries to create fact checklists for improving factual coverage, trains a self-assessment module based on the base model's knowledge for factual precision, and employs a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism - all without external knowledge.

Result: KLCF substantially improves factuality metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model hallucinations.

Conclusion: The proposed KLCF framework successfully addresses LLM hallucinations through knowledge-level consistency reinforcement learning, offering an efficient and scalable solution that doesn't rely on external retrieval or verification.

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability
of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference
rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries,
exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we
propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a
novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy
model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and
introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall
and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to
construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve
factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module
based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision
during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or
heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and
lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training.
Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality
metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model
hallucinations.

*Zehong Wang,Junlin Wu,ZHaoxuan Tan,Bolian Li,Xianrui Zhong,Zheli Liu,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoGo framework addresses LLM personalization challenges by combining local user memory with global collective memory and using a mediator to resolve conflicts, improving performance for both cold-start and biased users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM personalization faces two key challenges: cold-start problem (insufficient user history) and biasing problem (overfitting to skewed user preferences), both stemming from inability to model collective knowledge across users.

Method: Proposed LoGo framework with local-global memory: local memory for individual user preferences, global memory for shared interests across population, and a mediator module to resolve conflicts between local and global signals.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions.

Conclusion: Incorporating collective knowledge through the LoGo framework significantly enhances LLM personalization by addressing both cold-start and biasing problems.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to tailor model behavior to
individual users based on their historical interactions. However, its
effectiveness is often hindered by two key challenges: the \textit{cold-start
problem}, where users with limited history provide insufficient context for
accurate personalization, and the \textit{biasing problem}, where users with
abundant but skewed history cause the model to overfit to narrow preferences.
We identify both issues as symptoms of a common underlying limitation, i.e.,
the inability to model collective knowledge across users. To address this, we
propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines the personalized
local memory with a collective global memory that captures shared interests
across the population. To reconcile discrepancies between these two memory
sources, we introduce a mediator module designed to resolve conflicts between
local and global signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by both
warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions. These results
highlight the importance of incorporating collective knowledge to enhance LLM
personalization.

*Yoonah Park,Haesung Pyun,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KAPPA, a parameter-free method that aligns LLMs' hidden states to bridge the gap between their latent knowledge and actual predictions on multiple-choice questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail on multiple-choice questions despite having correct knowledge, showing a knowledge-prediction gap that needs investigation and mitigation.

Method: Probing analysis reveals two key bases in residual streams: knowledge basis (ground-truth probability) and prediction basis (model's predicted probability). KAPPA transforms hidden states to align these bases through projection-based adjustment.

Result: KAPPA substantially improves accuracy on binary-choice reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge, consistently outperforming baselines. It also works on free-form questions beyond MCQs.

Conclusion: The work provides a geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical method to better align model behavior with its latent knowledge through subspace alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form
generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction
gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that
residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important
bases: a \emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the
ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \emph{prediction basis} that encodes
the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that
incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states
along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned
Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention
that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the
knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice
reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA
substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While
optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as
supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its
effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new
geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical
method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.

Motivation: To enhance large language model performance on Islamic knowledge understanding and reasoning tasks for the QIAS 2025 shared task.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: BM25 for initial retrieval, dense embedding model for semantic matching, and cross-encoder reranking for precise content retrieval, evaluated with Fanar and Mistral LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid RAG system effectively improves LLM performance on Islamic knowledge tasks, with Fanar showing superior results in the best configuration.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to the QIAS 2025 shared task on Islamic
knowledge understanding and reasoning. We developed a hybrid
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines sparse and dense
retrieval methods with cross-encoder reranking to improve large language model
(LLM) performance. Our three-stage pipeline incorporates BM25 for initial
retrieval, a dense embedding retrieval model for semantic matching, and
cross-encoder reranking for precise content retrieval. We evaluate our approach
on both subtasks using two LLMs, Fanar and Mistral, demonstrating that the
proposed RAG pipeline enhances performance across both, with accuracy
improvements up to 25%, depending on the task and model configuration. Our best
configuration is achieved with Fanar, yielding accuracy scores of 45% in
Subtask 1 and 80% in Subtask 2.

*Arti Rani,Shweta Singh,Nihar Ranjan Sahoo,Gaurav Kumar Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Open-DeBias is a novel debiasing method using adapter modules to mitigate both known and unseen biases in LLMs, achieving significant improvements in QA accuracy and multilingual generalization with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often encode harmful biases that compromise fairness, but existing bias mitigation approaches are limited to predefined categories and cannot address novel or emergent biases.

Method: Proposed Open-DeBias method that leverages adapter modules for data-efficient and parameter-efficient debiasing, capable of handling both existing social/stereotypical biases and generalizing to unseen ones.

Result: Open-DeBias improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by 48% on ambiguous subsets and 6% on disambiguated ones, and achieves 84% accuracy in zero-shot transfer to Korean BBQ, demonstrating robust multilingual generalization.

Conclusion: Open-DeBias is an effective, robust, and language-agnostic solution for open-domain bias mitigation that works across various NLP tasks and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on question
answering (QA) tasks, yet they often encode harmful biases that compromise
fairness and trustworthiness. Most existing bias mitigation approaches are
restricted to predefined categories, limiting their ability to address novel or
context-specific emergent biases. To bridge this gap, we tackle the novel
problem of open-set bias detection and mitigation in text-based QA. We
introduce OpenBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases
across a wide range of categories and subgroups, encompassing both known and
previously unseen biases. Additionally, we propose Open-DeBias, a novel,
data-efficient, and parameter-efficient debiasing method that leverages adapter
modules to mitigate existing social and stereotypical biases while generalizing
to unseen ones. Compared to the state-of-the-art BMBI method, Open-DeBias
improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by nearly $48\%$ on ambiguous subsets and
$6\%$ on disambiguated ones, using adapters fine-tuned on just a small fraction
of the training data. Remarkably, the same adapters, in a zero-shot transfer to
Korean BBQ, achieve $84\%$ accuracy, demonstrating robust language-agnostic
generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we also validate the
effectiveness of Open-DeBias across a broad range of NLP tasks, including
StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, highlighting its robustness, multilingual strength,
and suitability for general-purpose, open-domain bias mitigation. The project

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPELL is a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context reasoning in LLMs through cyclical questioner-responder-verifier roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in long-context reasoning for LLMs has lagged due to intrinsic difficulty of processing long texts and scarcity of reliable human annotations and verifiable reward signals.

Method: SPELL integrates three cyclical roles (questioner, responder, verifier) within a single model for self-improvement, with automated curriculum for document length progression and adaptive reward function for question difficulty.

Result: Extensive experiments on six long-context benchmarks show SPELL consistently improves performance across diverse LLMs, achieving average 7.6-point gain in pass@8 on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking model.

Conclusion: SPELL outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned on large-scale annotated data and shows promise for scaling to even more capable models.

Abstract: Progress in long-context reasoning for large language models (LLMs) has
lagged behind other recent advances. This gap arises not only from the
intrinsic difficulty of processing long texts, but also from the scarcity of
reliable human annotations and programmatically verifiable reward signals. In
this paper, we propose SPELL, a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning
framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context
reasoning. SPELL integrates three cyclical roles-questioner, responder, and
verifier-within a single model to enable continual self-improvement. The
questioner generates questions from raw documents paired with reference
answers; the responder learns to solve these questions based on the documents;
and the verifier evaluates semantic equivalence between the responder's output
and the questioner's reference answer, producing reward signals to guide
continual training. To stabilize training, we introduce an automated curriculum
that gradually increases document length and a reward function that adapts
question difficulty to the model's evolving capabilities. Extensive experiments
on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL consistently improves
performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned
on large-scale annotated data. Notably, SPELL achieves an average 7.6-point
gain in pass@8 on the strong reasoning model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, raising
its performance ceiling and showing promise for scaling to even more capable
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Q-Tuning is a unified data pruning framework that jointly optimizes sample-level and token-level pruning for efficient supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, achieving superior performance with only 12.5% of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data pruning methods operate in isolation at either sample or token level, leading to inefficiencies where high-value samples may contain redundant tokens and token pruning discards crucial instructional signals.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Sample-level triage to retain examples with informative misconceptions or calibration signals, 2) Asymmetric token-pruning using context-aware scoring to trim less salient tokens from misconception samples while preserving calibration samples entirely.

Result: Sets new SOTA across five benchmarks. On SmolLM2-1.7B, achieves +38% average improvement over full-data SFT baseline using only 12.5% of original training data.

Conclusion: Q-Tuning is the first dynamic pruning approach to consistently outperform full-data training, providing a practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in budget-constrained LLM SFT.

Abstract: As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step
into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency
has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight
budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they
operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to
jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant
inefficiencies--high-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while
token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals
embedded in individual examples. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the
Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes
the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by
this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework
that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. Q-Tuning
employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain
examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it
applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring
mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples
while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. Our method sets a new
state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B,
Q-Tuning achieves a +38\% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline
using only 12.5\% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning
approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a
practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in
budget-constrained LLM SFT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocPruner is a framework that reduces storage overhead in Visual Document Retrieval by adaptively pruning redundant patch-level embeddings using intra-document attention distribution, achieving 50-60% storage reduction with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-vector VDR methods using LVLMs create prohibitive storage overhead by storing hundreds of vectors per page, making large-scale deployment costly and impractical.

Method: DocPruner employs adaptive patch-level embedding pruning by leveraging intra-document patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant embeddings for each document.

Result: Achieves 50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible degradation in document retrieval performance, validated across more than ten datasets.

Conclusion: DocPruner provides a robust, flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale VDR systems.

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), the task of retrieving visually-rich
document pages using queries that combine visual and textual cues, is crucial
for numerous real-world applications. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in a multi-vector paradigm, representing
each document as patch-level embeddings to capture fine-grained details. While
highly effective, this approach introduces a critical challenge: prohibitive
storage overhead, as storing hundreds of vectors per page makes large-scale
deployment costly and impractical. To address this, we introduce DocPruner, the
first framework to employ adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR to
effectively reduce the storage overhead. DocPruner leverages the intra-document
patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant
embeddings for each document. This adaptive mechanism enables a significant
50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible
degradation in document retrieval performance. Extensive experiments across
more than ten representative datasets validate that DocPruner offers a robust,
flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale
VDR systems.

*Jingyi Yang,Guanxu Chen,Xuhao Hu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes EOSER and ASS decoding strategies and CJ-GRPO reinforcement learning method to optimize masked diffusion language models, addressing training-inference inconsistencies and enabling efficient full diffusion-style decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion language models offer advantages like parallel decoding but lack tailored decoding strategies and RL algorithms. Direct transfer of AR model techniques creates inconsistencies due to MDLMs' non-causal parallel nature.

Method: Proposes EOSER (EOS Early Rejection) and ASS (Ascending Step-Size) decoding scheduler for full diffusion-style decoding, and CJ-GRPO (Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization) for consistent rollout and optimization trajectories.

Result: Experiments on reasoning tasks using LLaDA-8B-Instruct show competitive performance with fewer decoding steps, demonstrating effective and efficient taming of MDLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed EOSER, ASS mechanisms and CJ-GRPO method successfully address MDLM optimization challenges and enable efficient diffusion-style decoding with consistent training-inference alignment.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as
parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer
inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored.
A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR
models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive
transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding
strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they
outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL
algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a
training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal
(parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and
the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early
Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which
unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding,
achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we
introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO)
for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory
and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by
skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks,
such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The
results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with
CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs.

*Zhangdie Yuan,Zifeng Ding,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EVOLVECAST framework evaluates LLMs' ability to revise predictions when new information emerges, showing models are often inconsistent or overly conservative in updating forecasts compared to human forecasters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work treated future event prediction as static, ignoring how forecasts and confidence should evolve with new evidence. The gap is in evaluating LLMs' belief updating capabilities.

Method: EVOLVECAST framework assesses LLMs' prediction revisions when presented with post-training information, using human forecasters as reference to analyze prediction shifts and confidence calibration.

Result: LLMs show some responsiveness to new information but updates are inconsistent or overly conservative. Neither verbalized nor logits-based confidence estimates consistently outperform each other, both falling short of human standards.

Conclusion: Models exhibit conservative bias across settings, highlighting the need for more robust belief updating approaches in LLMs.

Abstract: Prior work has largely treated future event prediction as a static task,
failing to consider how forecasts and the confidence in them should evolve as
new evidence emerges. To address this gap, we introduce EVOLVECAST, a framework
for evaluating whether large language models appropriately revise their
predictions in response to new information. In particular, EVOLVECAST assesses
whether LLMs adjust their forecasts when presented with information released
after their training cutoff. We use human forecasters as a comparative
reference to analyze prediction shifts and confidence calibration under updated
contexts. While LLMs demonstrate some responsiveness to new information, their
updates are often inconsistent or overly conservative. We further find that
neither verbalized nor logits-based confidence estimates consistently
outperform the other, and both remain far from the human reference standard.
Across settings, models tend to express conservative bias, underscoring the
need for more robust approaches to belief updating.

TL;DR: Easy Turn is an open-source, modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-duplex interaction is crucial for natural human-machine communication but challenging due to the need for robust turn-taking detection. Existing solutions are limited by being closed-source, large in size, single-modal, or requiring scarce full-duplex data.

Method: Proposed Easy Turn, an open-source modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and linguistic bimodal information. Also released Easy Turn trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset for training turn-taking detection models.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art turn-taking detection accuracy on the open-source Easy Turn testset compared to existing open-source models like TEN Turn Detection and Smart Turn V2.

Conclusion: Easy Turn provides an effective solution for full-duplex interaction with open-source availability, bimodal integration, and strong performance, along with a large training dataset to address data scarcity issues.

Abstract: Full-duplex interaction is crucial for natural human-machine communication,
yet remains challenging as it requires robust turn-taking detection to decide
when the system should speak, listen, or remain silent. Existing solutions
either rely on dedicated turn-taking models, most of which are not
open-sourced. The few available ones are limited by their large parameter size
or by supporting only a single modality, such as acoustic or linguistic.
Alternatively, some approaches finetune LLM backbones to enable full-duplex
capability, but this requires large amounts of full-duplex data, which remain
scarce in open-source form. To address these issues, we propose Easy Turn, an
open-source, modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and
linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states: complete,
incomplete, backchannel, and wait, accompanied by the release of Easy Turn
trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset designed for training turn-taking
detection models. Compared to existing open-source models like TEN Turn
Detection and Smart Turn V2, our model achieves state-of-the-art turn-taking
detection accuracy on our open-source Easy Turn testset. The data and model

### [95] [Vision-Grounded Machine Interpreting: Improving the Translation Process through Visual Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23957)
*Claudio Fantinuoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI) integrates visual information from webcams to improve machine interpreting by resolving ambiguities, showing benefits for lexical disambiguation but limited gains for gender resolution and no improvement for syntactic ambiguities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine interpreting systems rely solely on linguistic signals, limiting performance in contexts where visual, situational, or pragmatic cues are needed for disambiguation and adequacy.

Method: Developed a prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech and visual input from a webcam, using visual information to prime the translation process. Evaluated using a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types of ambiguity.

Result: Visual grounding substantially improves lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities.

Conclusion: Embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing translation quality in machine interpreting systems.

Abstract: Machine Interpreting systems are currently implemented as unimodal, real-time
speech-to-speech architectures, processing translation exclusively on the basis
of the linguistic signal. Such reliance on a single modality, however,
constrains performance in contexts where disambiguation and adequacy depend on
additional cues, such as visual, situational, or pragmatic information. This
paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), a novel approach designed
to address the limitations of unimodal machine interpreting. We present a
prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech
and visual input from a webcam, with the aim of priming the translation process
through contextual visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of this
approach, we constructed a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types
of ambiguity. In our evaluation, visual grounding substantially improves
lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender
resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities. We argue that
embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing
translation quality in machine interpreting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiPO is a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to selectively decide when to use detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to respond directly (Think-off), reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs always generate lengthy reasoning traces with CoT, which is inefficient and leads to excessive token usage and higher inference costs.

Method: HiPO combines a hybrid data pipeline with paired Think-on/Think-off responses and a hybrid reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Experiments across mathematics and coding benchmarks show HiPO substantially reduces token length while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: HiPO provides a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in resource-sensitive settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating
lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and
higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization
(i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to
selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to
respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data
pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid
reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency
while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across
mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially
reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope
HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing
the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive
settings.

*Haonan Wang,Junfeng Sun,Xingdi Yuan,Ruoyao Wang,Ziang Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ByteSized32Refactored is a modular, extensible implementation of the ByteSized32 corpus for text game generation, featuring a GameBasic.py foundation library that reduces code by 50% and enables easier extension to new scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simulating interactive world models in LLMs by creating a more modular and extensible framework for text game generation that reduces code complexity and supports future extensions.

Method: Refactored the original ByteSized32 corpus by creating GameBasic.py foundation library with 7 base classes (GameObject, etc.) that centralize common logic across all 32 games, reducing total lines of Python code from 20k to 10k.

Result: GPT-4o experiments show mixed performance - quality improvements on two evaluation dimensions for unseen scenarios, but decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical refactored structure presents new challenges for LLMs.

Conclusion: The extensible code structure with foundation library and modular optimization facilitates LLM adaptation to environment specifications and establishes a scalable environment for future extensions, despite presenting new challenges for LLMs.

Abstract: Simulating interactive world models remains a core challenge in Large
Language Models(LLMs). In this work, we introduce the ByteSized32Refactored, a
refactored, modular, and extensible implementation of the original ByteSized32
corpus to explore the task of text game generation. We further optimize the
code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation
library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7
base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from
20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our
refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design,
ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of
new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and
functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of
performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen
scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation
dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical
structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we
highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation
library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to
environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that
supports future extensions.

*Lucio La Cava,Andrea Tagarelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PaLRS is a training-free method for LLM preference alignment that extracts steering vectors from residual streams using minimal preference data, enabling plug-and-play behavior control at inference time without expensive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference alignment methods like RLHF and DPO require curated data, expensive optimization over billions of parameters, and create persistent task-specific models, making them inefficient and inflexible.

Method: Extracts lightweight steering vectors from residual streams of LLMs using as few as 100 preference pairs, then applies these vectors at inference time to steer models toward preferred behaviors without training.

Result: PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline performance, and outperform DPO-aligned models with huge time savings.

Conclusion: PaLRS offers an effective, efficient, and flexible alternative to standard preference optimization pipelines, providing training-free, plug-and-play alignment with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models
(LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization
typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of
parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this
work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual
Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals
encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference
pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be
applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We
evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that
PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and
code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose
performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better
with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective,
much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference
optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for
alignment with minimal data.

*Dhaathri Vijay,Anandaswarup Vadapalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Model compression strategies like distillation and quantization can significantly reduce computational costs and environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about computational and environmental costs of large language models by investigating trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency.

Method: Compared full-scale, distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as case study. Evaluated on Flores+ benchmark and human judgments of conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Analyzed carbon emissions per evaluation run.

Result: Full 3.3B fp32 model had highest BLEU scores but largest environmental footprint (0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). Distilled models achieved 4.5x faster inference with minimal BLEU reductions. Aggressive quantization (INT4) preserved high accuracy and fluency with minor differences between models.

Conclusion: Model compression can substantially reduce computational demands and environmental impact while maintaining competitive quality. Evaluation frameworks should integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside objective metrics.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about their computational and environmental costs. This study investigates the
trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency by comparing full-scale,
distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We
evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of
conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis of
carbon emissions per evaluation run revealed that the full 3.3B fp32 model,
while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental
footprint (about 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled models achieved an
inference of up to 4.5x faster than the full 3.3B model, with only minimal
reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations also showed that even aggressive
quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with
differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that
model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and
environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though
trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. We argue for
evaluation frameworks that integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside
objective metrics as central dimensions of progress in NLP.

Motivation: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in industry, it is essential to safeguard them and bridge the critical policy-to-practice gap for verifiably safer and more regulatable AI.

Method: Introduces "Policy as Prompt" approach using LLMs to interpret natural language policies, constructs verifiable policy trees from technical artifacts, and compiles them into lightweight prompt-based classifiers that audit agent behavior at runtime.

Result: Validated across diverse applications, demonstrating a scalable and auditable pipeline that successfully bridges the policy-to-practice gap.

Conclusion: The framework paves the way for verifiably safer and more regulatable AI by providing automated translation of design documents into enforceable guardrails using LLM-based policy interpretation.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in industry, it is
essential to safeguard them. We introduce a novel framework that automates the
translation of unstructured design documents into verifiable, real-time

applying contextual understanding and the principle of least privilege. Our
system first ingests technical artifacts to construct a verifiable policy tree,
which is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers that audit

applications, demonstrating a scalable and auditable pipeline that bridges the
critical policy-to-practice gap, paving the way for verifiably safer and more

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCPMark is a new benchmark for evaluating MCP (Model Context Protocol) use in realistic workflows, featuring 127 tasks with diverse CRUD operations and automatic verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCP benchmarks are narrow in scope, focusing on read-heavy tasks with limited interaction depth, and fail to capture the complexity of real-world workflows.

Method: Created 127 high-quality tasks collaboratively by domain experts and AI agents, each with curated initial state and programmatic scripts for automatic verification. Evaluated LLMs using a minimal agent framework with tool-calling loops.

Result: Best-performing model (gpt-5-medium) achieved only 52.56% pass@1 and 33.86% pass^4. Other strong models like claude-sonnet-4 and o3 fell below 30% pass@1 and 15% pass^4. LLMs required average of 16.2 execution turns and 17.4 tool calls per task.

Conclusion: MCPMark effectively stress-tests MCP capabilities, revealing significant performance gaps and highlighting the need for more robust agent systems that can handle complex real-world interactions.

Abstract: MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the
foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow
in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction
depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows.
To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP
use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of $127$
high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents.
Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic
script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse
interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read,
update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a
tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model,
gpt-5-medium, reaches only $52.56$\% pass@1 and $33.86$\% pass^4, while other
widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below
$30$\% pass@1 and $15$\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require $16.2$ execution
turns and $17.4$ tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in
previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

TL;DR: SDLM introduces Next Sequence Prediction (NSP) to unify next-token and next-block prediction, enabling adaptive generation length and efficient retrofit of pre-trained autoregressive models with KV-cache compatibility and high throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of diffusion language models (fixed-length decoding, KV-cache incompatibility) and block diffusion (fixed block size, expensive training) by enabling adaptive generation length and efficient model adaptation.

Method: Propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM) with Next Sequence Prediction (NSP) that performs diffusion inference in fixed-size mask blocks but dynamically decodes subsequences based on model confidence, preserving KV-cache compatibility.

Result: SDLM matches or surpasses autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training samples, achieves 2.1× higher throughput than Qwen-2.5, with SDLM-32B showing even more pronounced efficiency gains.

Conclusion: SDLM demonstrates strong scalability potential with efficient retrofit of pre-trained models, adaptive generation, and significant throughput improvements while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have strong theoretical efficiency but are
limited by fixed-length decoding and incompatibility with key-value (KV)
caches. Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed
block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence
Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling
the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the
length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building
on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can
retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost.
Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks,
but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence,
thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying
uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM
matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training
samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the
SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating
the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm. Project page and

### [103] [SparseD: Sparse Attention for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24014)
*Zeqing Wang,Gongfan Fang,Xinyin Ma,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SparseD is a novel sparse attention method for diffusion language models that achieves up to 1.50× speedup over FlashAttention at 64k context length by using head-specific sparse patterns and full attention in early denoising steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source diffusion language models suffer from high inference latency due to attention's quadratic complexity, and sparse attention methods designed for autoregressive models are incompatible with DLMs due to different sparsity behaviors.

Method: SparseD pre-computes head-specific sparse patterns once and reuses them across all denoising steps, while using full attention in early critical steps and switching to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality.

Result: SparseD achieves lossless acceleration with up to 1.50× speedup over FlashAttention at 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.

Conclusion: SparseD provides a practical and efficient solution for deploying diffusion language models in long-context applications through its novel sparse attention approach.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to
autoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high
inference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic
complexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.
Intuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict
attention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.
Such approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and
clearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity
behaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in
each head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising
steps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention
methods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to
capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in
early denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel
sparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only
requires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them
across all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising
step. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches
to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these
establish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in
long-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD
achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\times$ speedup over
FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.

*Hongbo Liu,Jia Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ResFormer is a novel neural architecture that combines reservoir computing for long-term dependencies and Transformers for short-term dependencies, achieving significant accuracy improvements with reduced memory consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models have quadratic complexity that limits input length, making it challenging to process extensive contexts efficiently.

Method: ResFormer uses a cascaded approach: reservoir computing with nonlinear readout for long-term dependencies in linear time, and conventional Transformers for short-term sentence-level dependencies.

Result: Outperforms DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT with up to +22.3% accuracy improvement on EmoryNLP, and consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD, and IEMOCAP datasets with reduced memory usage.

Conclusion: ResFormer provides an effective and efficient solution for modeling extensive contextual information by combining the strengths of reservoir computing and Transformers.

Abstract: Sequence classification is essential in NLP for understanding and
categorizing language patterns in tasks like sentiment analysis, intent
detection, and topic classification. Transformer-based models, despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance, have inherent limitations due to
quadratic time and memory complexity, restricting their input length. Although
extensive efforts have aimed at reducing computational demands, processing
extensive contexts remains challenging.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose ResFormer, a novel neural network
architecture designed to model varying context lengths efficiently through a
cascaded methodology. ResFormer integrates an reservoir computing network
featuring a nonlinear readout to effectively capture long-term contextual
dependencies in linear time. Concurrently, short-term dependencies within
sentences are modeled using a conventional Transformer architecture with
fixed-length inputs.
  Experiments demonstrate that ResFormer significantly outperforms baseline
models of DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT, delivering an accuracy improvement of
up to +22.3% on the EmoryNLP dataset and consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD,
and IEMOCAP. In addition, ResFormer exhibits reduced memory consumption,
underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in modeling extensive contextual
information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes transformer ensemble model and LLM for cross-lingual sentiment analysis using multilingual datasets, achieving over 86% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment analysis struggles with foreign languages due to lack of labeled training data, limiting its effectiveness across different languages and applications.

Method: Used ensemble of pre-trained sentiment analysis models (bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment and XLM-R) on multilingual datasets for cross-lingual sentiment classification.

Result: Experimental results showed sentiment analysis performance exceeding 86% accuracy using the proposed ensemble approach.

Conclusion: The transformer ensemble model effectively addresses cross-lingual sentiment analysis challenges, demonstrating high accuracy across multiple languages.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a very important natural language processing activity
in which one identifies the polarity of a text, whether it conveys positive,
negative, or neutral sentiment. Along with the growth of social media and the
Internet, the significance of sentiment analysis has grown across numerous
industries such as marketing, politics, and customer service. Sentiment
analysis is flawed, however, when applied to foreign languages, particularly
when there is no labelled data to train models upon. In this study, we present
a transformer ensemble model and a large language model (LLM) that employs
sentiment analysis of other languages. We used multi languages dataset.
Sentiment was then assessed for sentences using an ensemble of pre-trained
sentiment analysis models: bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, and XLM-R.
Our experimental results indicated that sentiment analysis performance was more
than 86% using the proposed method.

*Matteo Boffa,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Large-Scale Constraint Generation (LSCG) to test LLMs' ability to handle many fine-grained constraints, proposes FoCusNet to help LLMs focus on relevant constraints, and shows existing methods struggle with many constraints while FoCusNet improves accuracy by 8-13%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs can parse large, fine-grained constraint lists, moving beyond few explicit requirements to more complex constraint handling scenarios.

Method: Created Words Checker as a practical LSCG instance, tested model characteristics and steering techniques, and proposed FoCusNet - a small model that filters constraints to help LLMs focus on relevant ones.

Result: Existing solutions suffer significant performance drops as constraint numbers increase, while FoCusNet provides 8-13% accuracy improvement over baseline methods.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with large constraint sets, and dedicated constraint filtering models like FoCusNet can significantly improve performance in large-scale constraint generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent research has explored the constrained generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted by few task-specific
requirements. In contrast, we introduce Large-Scale Constraint Generation
(LSCG), a new problem that evaluates whether LLMs can parse a large,
fine-grained, generic list of constraints. To examine the LLMs' ability to
handle an increasing number constraints, we create a practical instance of
LSCG, called Words Checker. In Words Checker, we evaluate the impact of model
characteristics (e.g., size, family) and steering techniques (e.g., Simple
Prompt, Chain of Thought, Best of N) on performance. We also propose FoCusNet,
a small and dedicated model that parses the original list of constraints into a
smaller subset, helping the LLM focus on relevant constraints. Experiments
reveal that existing solutions suffer a significant performance drop as the
number of constraints increases, with FoCusNet showing an 8-13% accuracy boost.

*Kaiyu He,Peilin Wu,Mian Zhang,Kun Wan,Wentian Zhao,Xinya Du,Zhiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GEAR is a novel evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' abductive reasoning capabilities through automated scoring of hypothesis sets based on consistency, generalizability, and diversity, without requiring human-labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating whether LLMs can discover new knowledge through abductive reasoning (generating plausible hypotheses from observations), moving beyond instruction following and deductive reasoning.

Method: GEAR evaluates hypothesis sets using three automated metrics: consistency (hypotheses explain observations), generalizability (hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and diversity (coverage of distinct predictions). Also proposes momentum-based curriculum learning that adjusts training data based on learning velocity.

Result: Evaluation of 9 LLMs on 4 abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems and 50,000+ hypotheses revealed model differences obscured by traditional evaluations. The momentum-based curriculum improved all GEAR objectives and transferred gains to established benchmarks without gold-label supervision.

Conclusion: GEAR provides a principled framework for evaluating abduction and supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more diverse and reliable hypotheses, advancing their knowledge discovery capabilities.

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on
instruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can
these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We
address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible
hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for
Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and
label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics:
consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability
(consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and
diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way,
GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring
aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when
models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate
once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine
LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000
candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or
purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that
adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what
the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating
diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives.
Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and
these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken
together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and
supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more
diverse and reliable hypotheses.

TL;DR: BTC-SAM is a novel framework that uses Large Language Models to automatically generate high-quality, diverse test cases for detecting social biases in Sentiment Analysis models, reducing the need for expensive manual test case creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment Analysis models contain harmful social biases that need systematic testing, but creating comprehensive test cases manually is expensive and requires domain expertise.

Method: Uses Large Language Models for controllable generation of test sentences that vary only in identity groups, providing linguistic variation and diversity for bias testing.

Result: BTC-SAM generates test sentences with high linguistic variation and diversity, offering better test coverage than base prompting methods, even for previously unseen biases.

Conclusion: LLM-based test case generation provides an effective and scalable approach for comprehensive bias testing in Sentiment Analysis models, overcoming limitations of manual test case creation.

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be
harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining
the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of
the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse
sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is
expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires
domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias
testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias
testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show
that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the
test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base
prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

*Guangliang Liu,Xi Chen,Bocheng Chen,Xitong Zhang,Kristen Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the generalization challenge in LLM moral reasoning by proposing pragmatic inference methods based on moral foundations theory to bridge the gap between distributional semantics and pragmatic-level moral reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moral reasoning is a promising research direction for LLMs, but achieving generalization remains difficult because LLMs operate at distributional semantics level while morals operate at pragmatic level.

Method: Proposed pragmatic inference methods grounded in moral foundations theory, leveraging contextual information at each step to bridge the pragmatic gap and connect moral foundations with moral reasoning objectives.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the approach significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning.

Conclusion: The method provides a foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory, successfully addressing the generalization challenge in LLM moral reasoning.

Abstract: Moral reasoning has emerged as a promising research direction for Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet achieving generalization remains a central
challenge. From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs
are adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs
from the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates
how LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on
distributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in
moral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to
bridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with
moral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a
foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory.

*Minsoo Kim,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GLoW introduces dual-scale world models for hard-exploration tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in text-based games with significantly fewer environment interactions than RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents struggle with hard-exploration tasks that require learning new knowledge through exploration, limiting their capabilities in complex environments.

Method: Uses dual-scale world models with a global trajectory frontier and local trial-and-error exploration through Multi-path Advantage Reflection mechanism that infers advantage-based progress signals.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance for LLM-based approaches on Jericho benchmark, with comparable performance to RL methods but requiring 100-800x fewer environment interactions.

Conclusion: GLoW demonstrates effective hard-exploration capabilities through its dual-scale approach, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have seen promising advances, yet they are still limited in
"hard-exploration" tasks requiring learning new knowledge through exploration.
We present GLoW, a novel approach leveraging dual-scale world models,
maintaining a trajectory frontier of high-value discoveries at the global
scale, while learning from local trial-and-error in exploration through a
Multi-path Advantage Reflection mechanism which infers advantage-based progress
signals to guide exploration. To evaluate our framework for hard-exploration,
we tackle the Jericho benchmark suite of text-based games, where GLoW achieves
a new state-of-theart performance for LLM-based approaches. Compared to
state-of-the-art RLbased methods, our approach achieves comparable performance
while requiring 100-800x fewer environment interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces EduVidQA Dataset for automated question answering from online lectures using MLLMs, benchmarks 6 state-of-the-art models, and provides student preference analysis for educational NLP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for automated student question answering in online education using multimodal approaches, as digital platforms redefine educational paradigms.

Method: Created EduVidQA Dataset with 5252 QA pairs from 296 computer science videos, studied student qualitative preferences, and benchmarked 6 MLLMs using text-based and qualitative metrics.

Result: Showed the challenging nature of the task, effectiveness of synthetic data for finetuning, and provided nuanced performance evaluation of models.

Conclusion: Sets a benchmark for educational question answering and opens exciting avenues for future NLP research in education.

Abstract: As digital platforms redefine educational paradigms, ensuring interactivity
remains vital for effective learning. This paper explores using Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to automatically respond to student questions
from online lectures - a novel question answering task of real world
significance. We introduce the EduVidQA Dataset with 5252 question-answer pairs
(both synthetic and real-world) from 296 computer science videos covering
diverse topics and difficulty levels. To understand the needs of the dataset
and task evaluation, we empirically study the qualitative preferences of
students, which we provide as an important contribution to this line of work.
Our benchmarking experiments consist of 6 state-of-the-art MLLMs, through which
we study the effectiveness of our synthetic data for finetuning, as well as
showing the challenging nature of the task. We evaluate the models using both
text-based and qualitative metrics, thus showing a nuanced perspective of the
models' performance, which is paramount to future work. This work not only sets
a benchmark for this important problem, but also opens exciting avenues for
future research in the field of Natural Language Processing for Education.

### [112] [Beyond Magic Words: Sharpness-Aware Prompt Evolving for Robust Large Language Models with TARE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24130)
*Guancheng Wan,Lucheng Fu,Haoxin Liu,Yiqiao Jin,Hui Yi Leong,Eric Hanchen Jiang,Hejia Geng,Jinhe Bi,Yunpu Ma,Xiangru Tang,B. Aditya Prakash,Yizhou Sun,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TARE and ATARE, derivative-free frameworks for robust prompt optimization that minimize textual sharpness by enforcing paraphrase invariance through adversarial sampling and robust selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods focus only on point-wise accuracy and are brittle to small paraphrases, causing large performance swings. There's a need for methods that ensure robustness against semantically equivalent text variations.

Method: TARE alternates between inner adversarial search with hard paraphrases and outer robust selection. ATARE adds anisotropic weights to shape semantic neighborhoods and adapts radius over time for exploration-fidelity balance.

Result: The methods preserve accuracy under paraphrasing and outperform accuracy-only prompt search approaches across diverse tasks while remaining computationally practical.

Conclusion: Minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to more robust prompts that maintain performance under semantic variations, addressing the brittleness of traditional prompt optimization methods.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully
engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging
from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search,
primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance
or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in
practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically
preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this
brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we
provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete,
semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion
over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no
gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual
Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between
an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard
paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose
neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic
weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to
balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose
design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve
accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while
remaining computationally practical.

### [113] [Your thoughts tell who you are: Characterize the reasoning patterns of LRMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24147)
*Yida Chen,Yuning Mao,Xianjun Yang,Suyu Ge,Shengjie Bi,Lijuan Liu,Saghar Hosseini,Liang Tan,Yixin Nie,Shaoliang Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LOT is a method that uses language models to compare reasoning traces from different large reasoning models and creates a human-readable taxonomy of their distinctive reasoning features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current comparisons of large reasoning models focus only on macro-level statistics like accuracy, leaving the question of whether different models actually reason differently unanswered.

Method: LOT uses a generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs, articulate their distinctive features in words, and model how these features predict the source model based on empirical distributions across outputs.

Result: Applied to 12 open-source LRMs on math, science, and coding tasks, LOT achieved 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from models differing in scale, family, or domain. It also improved smaller Qwen3 models' accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7% when aligning their reasoning style with the largest Qwen3.

Conclusion: LOT provides both quantitative classification and qualitative explanations of how different large reasoning models think, revealing systematic differences in reasoning styles that can be leveraged to improve model performance.

Abstract: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level
statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs
reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce
the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a
generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and
articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these
features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical
distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of
reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models
think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in
math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their
thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from
LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond
classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative
explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link
the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of
smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves
their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.

### [114] [Localizing Task Recognition and Task Learning in In-Context Learning via Attention Head Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24164)
*Haolin Yang,Hakaze Cho,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) framework to analyze in-context learning mechanisms in LLMs, identifying specialized attention heads for Task Recognition (TR) and Task Learning (TL) and showing their complementary roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile two dominant perspectives on in-context learning: component-level analysis of attention heads and holistic decomposition into TR and TL components, providing a unified understanding of ICL mechanisms.

Method: Proposed TSLA framework to identify TR and TL specialized attention heads, using correlation analysis, ablation studies, input perturbations, and steering experiments with geometric analysis of hidden states.

Result: TR heads align hidden states with task subspace for task recognition, while TL heads rotate hidden states within subspace toward correct labels for prediction. The framework reconciles previous findings like induction heads and task vectors.

Conclusion: The TSLA framework provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models execute in-context learning across diverse tasks and settings by decomposing the process into TR and TL components at the attention-head level.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of in-context learning (ICL) in
large language models by reconciling two dominant perspectives: the
component-level analysis of attention heads and the holistic decomposition of
ICL into Task Recognition (TR) and Task Learning (TL). We propose a novel
framework based on Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) to identify attention
heads specialized in TR and TL, and demonstrate their distinct yet
complementary roles. Through correlation analysis, ablation studies, and input
perturbations, we show that the identified TR and TL heads independently and
effectively capture the TR and TL components of ICL. Using steering experiments
with geometric analysis of hidden states, we reveal that TR heads promote task
recognition by aligning hidden states with the task subspace, while TL heads
rotate hidden states within the subspace toward the correct label to facilitate
prediction. We further show how previous findings on ICL mechanisms, including
induction heads and task vectors, can be reconciled with our
attention-head-level analysis of the TR-TL decomposition. Our framework thus
provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models
execute ICL across diverse tasks and settings.

### [115] [Task Vectors, Learned Not Extracted: Performance Gains and Mechanistic Insight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24169)
*Haolin Yang,Hakaze Cho,Kaize Ding,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learned Task Vectors (LTVs) as a direct training approach that outperforms extracted task vectors in accuracy and flexibility, while also analyzing how task vectors mechanistically influence LLM computations through attention circuits and linear propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for extracting task vectors from LLMs are cumbersome, opaque, and don't explain how task vectors influence computation. The authors aim to develop better task vectors and understand their mechanistic role in in-context learning.

Method: Proposed directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs) instead of extracting them. Conducted systematic analysis of how task vectors work mechanistically, examining attention-head OV circuits and propagation through Transformer layers.

Result: LTVs surpass extracted task vectors in accuracy and work effectively at arbitrary layers, positions, and with ICL prompts. Analysis shows task vectors steer predictions through attention-head OV circuits, with a small subset of 'key heads' being most decisive. TV propagation is largely linear despite Transformer nonlinearities.

Conclusion: LTVs provide a practical approach for obtaining effective task vectors and offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations of in-context learning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform new tasks from in-context
demonstrations, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent work
suggests that these demonstrations are compressed into task vectors (TVs),
compact task representations that LLMs exploit for predictions. However, prior
studies typically extract TVs from model outputs or hidden states using
cumbersome and opaque methods, and they rarely elucidate the mechanisms by
which TVs influence computation. In this work, we address both limitations.
First, we propose directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), which surpass
extracted TVs in accuracy and exhibit superior flexibility-acting effectively
at arbitrary layers, positions, and even with ICL prompts. Second, through
systematic analysis, we investigate the mechanistic role of TVs, showing that
at the low level they steer predictions primarily through attention-head OV
circuits, with a small subset of "key heads" most decisive. At a higher level,
we find that despite Transformer nonlinearities, TV propagation is largely
linear: early TVs are rotated toward task-relevant subspaces to improve logits
of relevant labels, while later TVs are predominantly scaled in magnitude.
Taken together, LTVs not only provide a practical approach for obtaining
effective TVs but also offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations
of ICL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAG-GUI is a lightweight VLM that enhances GUI agents by leveraging web tutorials at inference time, using supervised finetuning and self-guided rejection sampling finetuning to improve performance on complex digital tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents using VLMs face limitations due to scarce training data and the complexity of real-world tasks that require long-tailed knowledge for rare scenarios.

Method: RAG-GUI is warm-started via supervised finetuning (SFT) and refined through self-guided rejection sampling finetuning (RSF). It's designed as a model-agnostic plug-in that can enhance any VLM-based agent by leveraging web tutorials during inference.

Result: RAG-GUI consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes in three distinct tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: RAG-GUI shows practical plug-and-play capabilities for enhancing VLM-based GUI agents in real-world scenarios through its model-agnostic design and web tutorial integration.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in
automating complex digital tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world
applications is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent
complexity of these tasks, which frequently require long-tailed knowledge
covering rare, unseen scenarios. We propose RAG-GUI , a lightweight VLM that
leverages web tutorials at inference time. RAG-GUI is first warm-started via
supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection
sampling finetuning (RSF). Designed to be model-agnostic, RAG-GUI functions as
a generic plug-in that enhances any VLM-based agent. Evaluated across three
distinct tasks, it consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other
inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating
strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world
scenarios.

*Zhimeng Luo,Lixin Wu,Adam Frisch,Daqing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedIRT is an Item Response Theory-based framework for evaluating LLMs in medical applications, providing more nuanced performance rankings than traditional accuracy metrics by modeling latent model abilities, question difficulty, and discrimination across different medical topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional accuracy metrics are inadequate for evaluating LLMs in high-stakes medical applications as they fail to capture question characteristics or provide topic-specific insights, creating a need for more rigorous evaluation methodologies.

Method: Prospectively gathered responses from 80 diverse LLMs on a balanced 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark, using unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT models per topic to estimate latent model ability, question difficulty, and discrimination.

Result: Identified distinctive 'spiky' ability profiles where overall rankings can be misleading; GPT-5 was top performer in 8 of 11 domains but was outperformed by Claude-3-opus in Social Science and Communication, showing that even 23rd-ranked models can excel in specific competencies. IRT also helped identify flawed questions.

Conclusion: MedIRT establishes a robust, psychometrically grounded methodology essential for safe, effective, and trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare, providing a practical decision-support framework that integrates multi-factor competency profiles with operational metrics.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for high-stakes
medical applications, there has emerged a critical need for reliable and
accurate evaluation methodologies. Traditional accuracy metrics fail
inadequately as they neither capture question characteristics nor offer
topic-specific insights. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{MedIRT}, a
rigorous evaluation framework grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT), the gold
standard in high-stakes educational testing. Unlike previous research relying
on archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse
LLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one
unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's
latent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination,
yielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone.
Notably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall
rankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities. While
\texttt{GPT-5} was the top performer in a majority of domains (8 of 11), it was
outperformed in Social Science and Communication by \texttt{Claude-3-opus},
demonstrating that even an overall 23rd-ranked model can hold the top spot for
specific competencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate IRT's utility in auditing
benchmarks by identifying flawed questions. We synthesize these findings into a
practical decision-support framework that integrates our multi-factor
competency profiles with operational metrics. This work establishes a robust,
psychometrically grounded methodology essential for the safe, effective, and
trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PET framework tracks evolving user preferences by modeling them as dynamic probability distributions over interpretable preference clusters, outperforming direct generation methods in ranking quality and long-tail content recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct LLM generation for user preference prediction limits personalization, obscures user profiling, and exacerbates popularity bias. Need for transparent and interpretable preference tracking.

Method: Preference Evolution Tracking (PET) reframes the task as inferring dynamic probability distributions over stable preference clusters using logit-probing and generative classification techniques.

Result: PET improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG on public benchmarks and outperforms SOTA production model by 7 times in NDCG on real-world short-video platform data, excelling at long-tail content ranking.

Conclusion: PET transforms user profiling from direct preference list generation to transparent distributional preference mapping, enabling more explainable, fair, and diverse personalization systems.

Abstract: Understanding how user preference evolves over time is a fundamental
challenge central to modern digital ecosystems, for which Large Language Models
(LLMs) are an increasingly prominent and popular approach due to their ability
to comprehend the rich semantic context within behavioral data. A common
practice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating
a ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction,
the end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its
opaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates
popularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution
Tracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic
probability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference
clusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques,
PET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling
transparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET
improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines.
On a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at
ranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model
by 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model
from direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional
preference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse
personalization systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AceSearcher is a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single LLM to alternate between decomposing complex queries and solving them using retrieved contexts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning tasks with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search-augmented LLMs struggle with complex reasoning due to ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability, requiring a solution that can better handle query decomposition and context integration.

Method: A cooperative self-play framework where a single LLM alternates between two roles: decomposer (breaks down complex queries) and solver (integrates retrieved contexts for answer generation), using supervised fine-tuning on search/reasoning/decomposition tasks and reinforcement fine-tuning optimized for final answer accuracy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with 7.6% average exact match improvement, achieves comparable performance to DeepSeek-V3 with <5% parameters on finance reasoning, and surpasses larger models (up to 9x parameters) at smaller scales (1.5B and 8B).

Conclusion: AceSearcher demonstrates exceptional efficiency and effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks through its cooperative self-play approach, eliminating the need for intermediate annotations while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to
ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose
AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large
language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks
down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer
generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of
search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning
optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate
annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10
datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on
document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance
of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller
scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented
LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and
effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes linguistic confidence (LC) as a lightweight alternative to traditional confidence estimation methods for LLMs, using hedging language to express uncertainty naturally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing confidence estimation methods face practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally expensive, and numerical uncertainty scores deviate from natural communication.

Method: Released a large-scale dataset of hedging expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, proposed a lightweight mapper to convert hedges into confidence scores, conducted systematic study of LC across LLMs, and introduced a fine-tuning framework to improve LC reliability.

Result: Most LLMs underperform in expressing reliable linguistic confidence, but carefully designed prompting achieves competitive calibration and discriminability. Fine-tuning further improves LC reliability.

Conclusion: Linguistic confidence offers a scalable, efficient, and human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation that warrants deeper exploration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation
has been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face
practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally
expensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score)
deviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC),
where models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably,
might), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this
direction, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging
expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a
lightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero
cost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of
LC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs
underperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves
competitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a
fine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our
work positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and
human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper
exploration of this promising yet underexplored direction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BeyondBench is a contamination-free evaluation framework that uses algorithmic problem generation to test language models' reasoning abilities across 44 tasks with 117 variations, revealing consistent reasoning deficiencies especially in complex problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarks risk contamination from internet training data, making it unclear if models are reasoning or just memorizing answers. There's a need for fresh, uncontaminated evaluation methods.

Method: Uses algorithmic problem generation with 44 tasks across three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) that create mathematically grounded problems on-the-fly from a combinatorial space >10^15 unique instances, with solutions verified by mathematical proofs.

Result: Evaluated 101 models (85 open-source, 16 closed-source) showing consistent reasoning deficiencies. Performance degrades sharply with complexity - in Hard Suite: Gemini-2.5-pro (56.38%), Llama-3.3-70B (26.91%), Qwen2.5-72B (33.60%). Performance drops drastically without tools (GPT-5 family shows 16.81-47.59% decline).

Conclusion: Language models have significant reasoning limitations, especially on complex algorithmic problems, and current benchmarks may overestimate capabilities due to contamination issues.

Abstract: Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks
available on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it
unclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this
paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this
problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks
that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates
mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh
and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of
117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks)
for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations)
for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68
variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each
task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique
instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We
evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source
models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization
schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model
families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases
from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as
Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of
56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance
drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano
showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite. Our

TL;DR: ScenarioBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Text-to-SQL and RAG systems in compliance contexts, focusing on decision accuracy, trace quality, and falsifiable explanations tied to policy clauses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-SQL and RAG benchmarks lack rigorous evaluation of justification quality and evidence-based decision-making in compliance scenarios where explanations must be audit-ready and falsifiable.

Method: Uses YAML scenarios with no-peek gold-standard packages containing expected decisions, witness traces, governing clauses, and canonical SQL. Systems must justify outputs using clause IDs from policy canon.

Result: Provides end-to-end scoring of decision accuracy, trace quality, retrieval effectiveness, SQL correctness, policy coverage, latency, and explanation-hallucination rate with normalized difficulty metrics.

Conclusion: ScenarioBench shifts evaluation focus toward justification quality under explicit time constraints, offering more rigorous assessment of compliance-oriented Text-to-SQL and RAG systems compared to prior benchmarks.

Abstract: ScenarioBench is a policy-grounded, trace-aware benchmark for evaluating
Text-to-SQL and retrieval-augmented generation in compliance contexts. Each
YAML scenario includes a no-peek gold-standard package with the expected
decision, a minimal witness trace, the governing clause set, and the canonical
SQL, enabling end-to-end scoring of both what a system decides and why. Systems
must justify outputs using clause IDs from the same policy canon, making
explanations falsifiable and audit-ready. The evaluator reports decision
accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval
effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage,
latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate. A normalized Scenario
Difficulty Index (SDI) and a budgeted variant (SDI-R) aggregate results while
accounting for retrieval difficulty and time. Compared with prior Text-to-SQL
or KILT/RAG benchmarks, ScenarioBench ties each decision to clause-level
evidence under strict grounding and no-peek rules, shifting gains toward
justification quality under explicit time budgets.

Abstract: Identifying human morals and values embedded in language is essential to
empirical studies of communication. However, researchers often face substantial
difficulty navigating the diversity of theoretical frameworks and data
available for their analysis. Here, we contribute MoVa, a well-documented suite
of resources for generalizable classification of human morals and values,
consisting of (1) 16 labeled datasets and benchmarking results from four
theoretically-grounded frameworks; (2) a lightweight LLM prompting strategy
that outperforms fine-tuned models across multiple domains and frameworks; and

we specifically recommend a classification strategy, all@once, that scores all
related concepts simultaneously, resembling the well-known multi-label
classifier chain. The data and methods in MoVa can facilitate many fine-grained
interpretations of human and machine communication, with potential implications
for the alignment of machine behavior.

Conclusion: The approach of using Qwen3-14B with LoRA fine-tuning, model fusion, and multi-LoRA inference via vLLM is effective for building in-game conversational AI systems that meet competition requirements while considering resource and time constraints.

Abstract: This paper presents the opdainlp team's solution for the GPU track of the
CPDC 2025 challenge. The challenge consists of three tasks, aiming to build an
in-game conversational AI that adheres to character personas, aligns with the
game's worldview, and supports function calling. Considering both effectiveness
and resource/time constraints during inference, we synthesized data for some of
the tasks based on the datasets provided by the competition organizers. We
employed Qwen3-14B with LoRA fine-tuning and model fusion, and utilized a base
model integrated with multiple LoRA adapters during inference. Specifically, in
the competition, we used three distinct LoRA adapters to handle tool calling,
response generation with tool call results, and response generation without
tool call results, respectively. MultiLoRA inference was implemented using
vLLM. Our solution achieved the first place in Task 1 and Task 3, and the
second place in Task 2 of the GPU track.

*Xiaohe Bo,Rui Li,Zexu Sun,Quanyu Dai,Zeyu Zhang,Zihang Tian,Xu Chen,Zhenhua Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaTuner is a framework that jointly optimizes prompts and fine-tunes parameters for LLMs, enabling synergistic improvement through shared knowledge encoding and supervised regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work studied prompt optimization and fine-tuning separately, leaving their synergistic potential unexplored. The paper aims to bridge this gap by integrating both approaches.

Method: Introduces two neural networks for prompt generation and parameter updates with a shared encoding layer. Uses supervised regularization loss to handle discrete prompt optimization and continuous fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show consistent outperformance over baseline methods.

Conclusion: Joint integration of prompt optimization and fine-tuning through MetaTuner framework effectively improves LLM performance by discovering optimal prompt-parameter combinations.

Abstract: Prompt optimization and fine-tuning are two major approaches to improve the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). They enhance the capabilities of
LLMs from complementary perspectives: the former through explicit natural
language, and the latter through implicit parameter updates. However, prior
work has typically studied them in isolation, leaving their synergistic
potential largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we
introduce MetaTuner, a novel framework that jointly integrates prompt
optimization and fine-tuning for LLM training. Specifically, we introduce two
neural networks to generate prompts and parameters, respectively, while
allowing them to share a common bottom encoding layer to enable knowledge
sharing. By the guidance of the final supervised signals, our framework is
optimized to discover the optimal combinations between the prompts and
parameters. Given that prompt learning involves discrete optimization while
fine-tuning operates in a continuous parameter space, we design a supervised
regularization loss to train our framework effectively. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms the
baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimuHome is a time-accelerated smart home simulator built on Matter protocol that provides realistic device interactions and environmental changes, with a benchmark of 600 episodes showing LLM agents struggle with latent intent inference and temporal scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of realistic simulation environments and challenging benchmarks for developing smart home agents that can handle latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, and scheduling.

Method: Built SimuHome simulator on Matter protocol with time-acceleration, smart device simulation, API support, and environmental variable tracking. Created benchmark of 600 episodes across 12 user query types and evaluated 11 agents under unified ReAct framework.

Result: Even top-performing GPT-4.1 achieved only 54% success rate. Models struggle with latent intent inference, state verification, and temporal scheduling, performing well only on simple tasks.

Conclusion: There is critical need for methods that can reliably verify current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent actions in smart home environments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks.
However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle
latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and
more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such
capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where
agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a
challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart
devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables.
By building the simulator on the Matter protocol (the global industry standard
for smart home communication), SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment,
and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant
devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600
episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned
capabilities. Our evaluation of 11 agents under a unified ReAct framework
reveals that while models perform well on simple tasks, they struggle with
latent intent inference, state verification, and especially temporal
scheduling. Even the top-performing model, GPT-4.1, reaches only 54% success
rate. These findings highlight a critical need for methods that can reliably
verify the current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent
actions.

*Yu-Che Tsai,Kuan-Yu Chen,Yuan-Chi Li,Yuan-Hao Chen,Ching-Yu Tsai,Shou-De Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GIRCSE is a novel framework that uses generative iterative refinement for sentence embeddings, outperforming encoder-only LLM-based methods and showing improved performance with more inference tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based embeddings treat LLMs as static feature extractors, ignoring their generative capabilities and missing latent concepts and implicit semantics.

Method: GIRCSE uses autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic representations through sequences of soft tokens optimized under a contrastive objective with Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR).

Result: GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on MTEB benchmark and instruction-following tasks, and exhibits emergent test-time scaling where more tokens improve embedding quality.

Conclusion: Generative iterative refinement establishes a new paradigm for representation learning that better leverages LLMs' core generative strengths.

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an
encoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and
overlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative
Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework
that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic
representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under
contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics
that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an
Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each
refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show
that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB
benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an
emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference
steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative
refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.

standardized, unbiased evaluation. Across five diverse corpora, LOGOS
consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves a remarkable $88.2\%$
alignment with an expert-developed schema on a complex dataset. LOGOS
demonstrates a powerful new path to democratize and scale qualitative research
without sacrificing theoretical nuance.

*Zherui Li,Zheng Nie,Zhenhong Zhou,Yufei Guo,Yue Liu,Yitong Zhang,Yu Cheng,Qingsong Wen,Kun Wang,Jiaheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes vulnerabilities in Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) to jailbreak attacks, identifies key issues like greedy remasking bias and Denoising-path Dependence, and proposes DiffuGuard - a training-free defense framework that reduces attack success rates from 47.9% to 14.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of dLLMs introduces unique vulnerabilities distinct from Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation mechanisms, requiring specialized security analysis and defenses.

Method: The paper conducts vulnerability analysis across intra-step and inter-step dimensions, then proposes DiffuGuard - a dual-stage defense framework with Stochastic Annealing Remasking (to mitigate greedy selection bias) and Block-level Audit and Repair (for autonomous risk detection and correction).

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four dLLMs show DiffuGuard reduces Attack Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while preserving model utility and efficiency.

Conclusion: dLLMs possess substantial intrinsic safety potential that can be unlocked through proper defense mechanisms like DiffuGuard, which effectively addresses vulnerabilities while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces
unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from
Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation
mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM
vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step
and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in
the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we
term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens
decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while
current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs
possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we
propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses
vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking
dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias,
while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for
autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on
four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack
Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while
preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: A framework for transforming Text-Only QA pairs into high-quality Multi-Modal QA pairs using an agentic system called Q-Mirror, which iteratively refines MMQAs through generation and evaluation loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of high-quality multi-modal benchmarks is costly and unscalable, creating a bottleneck for advancing scientific reasoning in large models.

Method: Developed a TQA-to-MMQA framework with quality rubric, constructed benchmarks for evaluation, and created Q-Mirror agent that integrates MMQA generation and evaluation in a closed loop for iterative refinement.

Result: State-of-the-art models generate MMQAs but with substantial gaps; top understanding models align with human judgment; Q-Mirror agent improved average scores from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72% to 95%.

Conclusion: The Q-Mirror agent provides a practical path to large-scale scientific benchmarks by effectively transforming text-only QA pairs into high-quality multi-modal QA pairs through iterative refinement.

Abstract: High-quality, multi-modal benchmarks are crucial for advancing scientific
reasoning in large models yet their manual creation is costly and unscalable.
To address this bottleneck, we explore the potential for transforming Text-Only
QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs), which include
three parts: 1) Task Definition \& Evaluation Rubric: We develop a TQA-to-MMQA
framework and establish a comprehensive, multi-dimensional MMQA quality rubric
that provides principles for the transformation. 2) Benchmark Construction:
Then we construct two extensive benchmarks to rigorously evaluate
state-of-the-art generation \& understanding models on the distinct tasks of
MMQA generation \& MMQA quality evaluation. 3) Preliminary Solution: We develop
an agentic system (Q-Mirror), which operationalizes our framework by
integrating MMQA generation and evaluation into a closed loop for iterative
refinement. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art models can
generate MMQAs, their outputs still leave substantial gaps, underscoring the
need for reliable evaluation. We further demonstrate that top-tier
understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality
assessment. Leveraging both insights, the Q-Mirror agent raises average scores
from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72\% to 95\%, offering a practical path
to large-scale scientific benchmarks.

### [132] [Dual Mechanisms of Value Expression: Intrinsic vs. Prompted Values in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24319)
*Jongwook Han,Jongwon Lim,Injin Kong,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs express values through intrinsic (learned) and prompted (elicited) mechanisms that partly share components but have unique elements, leading to different steerability and response diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether intrinsic and prompted value expressions in LLMs share mechanisms or rely on substantially different ones, which is crucial for value alignment and persona steering applications.

Method: Used two mechanistic approaches: (1) value vectors extracted from residual stream representing value mechanisms, and (2) value neurons (MLP neurons) that contribute to value expressions.

Result: Intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common components crucial for value expression but also possess unique elements that manifest differently, leading to different steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and response diversity (intrinsic > prompted).

Conclusion: The two value expression mechanisms have both shared and unique components, with intrinsic mechanisms promoting lexical diversity and prompted mechanisms strengthening instruction following, even affecting distant tasks like jailbreaking.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct
ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned
during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts.
Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is
paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly
whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially
different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at
the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature
directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream,
and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We
demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common
components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess
unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms
lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and
response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to
the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas
those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction
following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the emergence of multimodal LLMs and increasing demands for higher-level semantics in AI for Science, there is a need for a systematic review consolidating recent developments in multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning.

Method: The paper conducts a comprehensive survey approach, analyzing model architectures, datasets, performance benchmarks, and providing practical insights through a GitHub repository summary.

Result: This survey establishes an authoritative reference for researchers, highlighting key challenges and outlining future research directions in the intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition.

Conclusion: This work fills a critical gap by providing the first systematic review of LLMs and MLLMs for emotion recognition and reasoning, offering both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for advancing this rapidly growing field.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in
language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general
intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higher-level semantics and
cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged,
integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to
enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science,
multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing
frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the
field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To
address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs
for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets,
and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline
future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative
reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the
intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning. The

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speculative Verification (SV) enhances speculative decoding by dynamically predicting speculation accuracy and adapting verification length to maximize throughput, achieving up to 2× speedup over standard speculative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard speculative decoding suffers from overhead when speculation accuracy is low, especially at large batch sizes, limiting its effectiveness for efficient LLM inference.

Method: SV introduces a companion model to estimate alignment between draft and target model distributions, dynamically predicting speculation accuracy and adapting verification length to reduce wasted computation on rejected tokens.

Result: SV consistently outperforms both speculative decoding and standard decoding across all experiments, improving SD performance by up to 2× with average 1.4× speedup in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80).

Conclusion: SV demonstrates robustness, scalability, and practical utility for efficient LLM inference without requiring modifications to draft or target models.

Abstract: LLMs have low GPU efficiency and high latency due to autoregressive decoding.
Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this using a small draft model to
speculatively generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by
a target model. However, when speculation accuracy is low, the overhead from
rejected tokens can offset the benefits, limiting SD's effectiveness,
especially at large batch sizes. To address this, we propose Speculative
Verification (SV), an efficient augmentation to SD that dynamically predicts
speculation accuracy and adapts the verification length to maximize throughput.
SV introduces a companion model - a small auxiliary model similar in size to
the draft model - to estimate the alignment between draft and target model
distributions. By maximizing the information gain from quantifying this
alignment, SV refines verification decisions, reducing wasted computation on
rejected tokens and improving decoding efficiency. Moreover, SV requires no
modifications to the draft or target models and is compatible with existing SD
variants. We extensively evaluated SV on publicly available LLMs across three
NLP tasks using nine combinations of draft, companion, and target models,
including 13B-72B target models and three types of variations: base (no
finetuning), instruction-tuned, and task fine-tuned. Across all experiments and
batch sizes (4-80), SV consistently outperforms both SD and standard decoding
with the target model. It improves SD performance by up to 2$\times$, with an
average speedup of 1.4 $\times$ in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80).
These results demonstrate SV's robustness, scalability, and practical utility
for efficient LLM inference.

*Mengyu Bu,Shaolei Zhang,Zhongjun He,Hua Wu,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AlignX is a two-stage framework that improves multilingual performance of LLMs through representation alignment and instruction fine-tuning, addressing performance gaps for non-dominant languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual LLMs often underperform on non-dominant languages and have poor cross-lingual alignment. Current fine-tuning approaches lead to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge transfer.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Align multilingual representations using semantic alignment and language feature integration, 2) Stimulate multilingual capability via instruction fine-tuning.

Result: Experimental results show enhanced multilingual general and cross-lingual generation capabilities. Analysis confirms closer multilingual representations and improved cross-lingual alignment.

Conclusion: AlignX effectively bridges the multilingual performance gap in LLMs by improving representation alignment and cross-lingual capabilities through a systematic two-stage approach.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) possess impressive multilingual
understanding and generation capabilities. However, their performance and
cross-lingual alignment often lag for non-dominant languages. A common solution
is to fine-tune LLMs on large-scale and more balanced multilingual corpus, but
such approaches often lead to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge
transfer, struggling with limited improvements across languages. In this paper,
we propose AlignX to bridge the multilingual performance gap, which is a
two-stage representation-level framework for enhancing multilingual performance
of pre-trained LLMs. In the first stage, we align multilingual representations
with multilingual semantic alignment and language feature integration. In the
second stage, we stimulate the multilingual capability of LLMs via multilingual
instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results on several pre-trained LLMs
demonstrate that our approach enhances LLMs' multilingual general and
cross-lingual generation capability. Further analysis indicates that AlignX
brings the multilingual representations closer and improves the cross-lingual
alignment.

*Matthew Theodore Roque,Dan John Velasco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study examines curriculum learning in language model pretraining with limited data, focusing on text complexity ordering and data augmentation via simplification. Finds that simplified data improves performance over repeated exposure, with optimal ordering strategies varying by model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most pretraining research focuses on large datasets, leaving optimization in data-constrained settings underexplored. Questions remain about training data order effects and including alternative text versions in limited data scenarios.

Method: Built parallel corpora with human-written paragraphs aligned with LLM-simplified variants. Tested four data schedules: repeated exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. Analyzed representation quality via fine-tuning and zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge, entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning.

Result: Adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over repeated-exposure baseline. Smaller models benefit from low-to-high complexity ordering, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning strategies in pretraining should be tailored to model size, with simplified data providing consistent benefits over simple data repetition in constrained data settings.

Abstract: Most studies on language model pretraining focus on large datasets, leaving
open questions about optimization in data-constrained settings. In such
settings, the effects of training data order and of including alternative
versions of the same text remain underexplored. We address this by studying
curriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and
data augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts
enhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2)
Does ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer,
we build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are
aligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated
exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze
models' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via
fine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge,
entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our findings show
that adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over
a repeated-exposure baseline: smaller models benefit from low-to-high
complexity, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

*Yijun Tian,Shaoyu Chen,Zhichao Xu,Yawei Wang,Jinhe Bi,Peng Han,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes RMT, a reinforcement mid-training framework between pre-training and post-training that addresses inefficiency, token entropy imbalance, and token underutilization through dynamic token budgeting, curriculum-based sampling, and dual training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM development has only pre-training and post-training stages, missing an intermediate reinforcement mid-training stage that could provide significant performance gains.

Method: RMT framework with three key components: (1) dynamic token budget mechanism to limit unnecessary reasoning steps, (2) curriculum-based adaptive sampling for progressive learning from easy to hard tokens, (3) dual training strategy combining RL with next-token prediction.

Result: Achieves up to +64.91% performance improvement with only 21% of reasoning length in language modeling, and checkpoints from mid-training improve subsequent post-training by up to +18.76% in mathematical domain.

Conclusion: Reinforcement mid-training is a valuable intermediate stage that significantly enhances LLM performance and efficiency, with RMT framework effectively addressing key challenges in this stage.

Abstract: The development of state-of-the-art large language models is commonly
understood as a two-stage process involving pre-training and post-training. We
point out the need for an additional intermediate stage called reinforcement
mid-training with potential for strong performance gains. In this paper, we
formally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient
training due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced
token entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To
address these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive,
and unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In
particular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains
unnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a
curriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning
trajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training
strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction,
ensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with
only 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling. We also show that
checkpoints obtained after reinforcement mid-training can benefit the
subsequent post-training, yielding up to +18.76% improvement in the
mathematical domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HarmMetric Eval is a benchmark for evaluating harmfulness metrics and judges in LLM jailbreak attacks, showing that traditional metrics like METEOR and ROUGE-1 outperform LLM-based judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of jailbreak attacks and diverse evaluation metrics without systematic assessment undermines credibility of reported jailbreak effectiveness and risks.

Method: Created HarmMetric Eval benchmark with high-quality dataset of harmful prompts paired with diverse responses, and flexible scoring mechanism for various metrics and judges.

Result: Surprising finding that traditional metrics (METEOR and ROUGE-1) outperform LLM-based judges in evaluating harmfulness of model responses.

Conclusion: Challenges prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in harmfulness evaluation and provides a systematic benchmark for assessing jailbreak evaluation metrics.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to
elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak
attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the
harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark
to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines
the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To
address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness
metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of
representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful
model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various
metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a
surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform
LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging
prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is
publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more computationally efficient diffusion language model by integrating sparse MoE architecture while maintaining competitive performance with reduced inference overhead.

Method: Trained from scratch on ~20T tokens using Mixture-of-Experts architecture, maintaining 7B total parameters but activating only 1.4B during inference. Also includes instruction-tuned variants.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion language models, surpassing LLaDA, LLaDA 1.5, and Dream across multiple benchmarks. LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct performs comparably to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct in knowledge, code, math, and agent tasks despite fewer active parameters.

Conclusion: Integrating sparse MoE architecture into masked diffusion language models successfully leverages MoE's strengths for efficient inference and opens new research directions for diffusion language models.

Abstract: We introduce LLaDA-MoE, a large language diffusion model with the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, trained from scratch on approximately
20T tokens. LLaDA-MoE achieves competitive performance with significantly
reduced computational overhead by maintaining a 7B-parameter capacity while
activating only 1.4B parameters during inference. Our empirical evaluation
reveals that LLaDA-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion
language models with larger parameters, surpassing previous diffusion language
models LLaDA, LLaDA 1.5, and Dream across multiple benchmarks. The
instruct-tuned model LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct demonstrates capabilities
comparable to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct in knowledge understanding, code generation,
mathematical reasoning, agent and alignment tasks, despite using fewer active
parameters. Our results show that integrating a sparse MoE architecture into
the training objective of masked diffusion language models still brings out
MoE's strengths under efficient inference with few active parameters, and opens
ample room for further exploration of diffusion language models. LLaDA-MoE
models are available at Huggingface.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiSpider 2.0 extends Spider 2.0 to 8 languages, revealing a significant multilingual gap in Text-to-SQL systems where state-of-the-art LLMs achieve only 4% execution accuracy without external reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most Text-to-SQL benchmarks are English-only, limiting progress in multilingual capabilities. There's a need to evaluate and improve Text-to-SQL systems across diverse languages and dialects.

Method: Extended Spider 2.0 benchmark to 8 languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese) while preserving structural difficulty. Also introduced a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively refines queries.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs achieved only 4% execution accuracy on intrinsic reasoning versus 60% on MultiSpider 1.0. The collaboration-driven approach improved accuracy to 15%, still revealing a substantial multilingual performance gap.

Conclusion: There exists a significant multilingual gap in Text-to-SQL systems, motivating the development of methods that are robust across languages and ready for real-world enterprise deployment.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are
English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0,
extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's
structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability,
demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art
LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when
relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we
provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively
refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial
multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and
ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at

Motivation: Existing benchmarks for Large Language Models often focus on isolated abilities and lack a holistic framework for comprehensive capability assessment, creating a gap in evaluation methodology.

Method: Proposes the CDT framework that measures model capabilities across three dimensions, incorporating Cattell-Horn-Carroll cognitive theory to refine capability categorization. Applied in dataset capability evaluation and data selection.

Result: Capability metrics correlate well with downstream performance. Data selection experiments show significant improvements: 44.3 and 45.4 scores with 1.6 and 2.2 point increases over baselines on general and specific benchmarks respectively.

Conclusion: The CDT framework is validated as effective and practical for comprehensive LLM capability assessment, supporting dataset analysis and construction.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
their capabilities, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluation
frameworks that extend beyond task-specific benchmarks. However, existing
benchmarks often focus on isolated abilities, lacking a holistic framework for
assessing LLM capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the
Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT) framework, which comprehensively measures a model's
capabilities across three dimensions. We expand the scope of model capability
definitions at the cognitive level by incorporating the Cattell-Horn-Carroll
cognitive theory, refining the categorization of model capabilities. We apply
CDT in two directions: dataset capability evaluation and data selection.
Experiments show that our capability metrics correlate well with downstream
performance and can support effective dataset analysis and construction. The
experiments on data selection also show significant improvements in both
general and specific benchmarks, achieving scores of 44.3 and 45.4, with an
increase of 1.6 and 2.2 points over the baselines, respectively. These results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of CDT. Source code and models are

TL;DR: This survey categorizes alternatives to Next Token Prediction (NTP) in LLMs into five families to address NTP's limitations like poor planning and computational inefficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NTP has driven LLM success but causes persistent weaknesses including poor long-term planning, error accumulation, and computational inefficiency. There's growing interest in exploring NTP alternatives.

Method: The survey categorizes NTP alternatives into five main families: Multi-Token Prediction, Plan-then-Generate, Latent Reasoning, Continuous Generation Approaches, and Non-Transformer Architectures.

Result: The paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy of emerging alternatives to NTP, synthesizing insights across different approaches to address token-level generation limitations.

Conclusion: This survey offers a taxonomy to guide research into models that overcome NTP's limitations, aiming to develop transformative new models for natural language processing.

Abstract: The paradigm of Next Token Prediction (NTP) has driven the unprecedented
success of Large Language Models (LLMs), but is also the source of their most
persistent weaknesses such as poor long-term planning, error accumulation, and
computational inefficiency. Acknowledging the growing interest in exploring
alternatives to NTP, the survey describes the emerging ecosystem of
alternatives to NTP. We categorise these approaches into five main families:
(1) Multi-Token Prediction, which targets a block of future tokens instead of a
single one; (2) Plan-then-Generate, where a global, high-level plan is created
upfront to guide token-level decoding; (3) Latent Reasoning, which shifts the
autoregressive process itself into a continuous latent space; (4) Continuous
Generation Approaches, which replace sequential generation with iterative,
parallel refinement through diffusion, flow matching, or energy-based methods;
and (5) Non-Transformer Architectures, which sidestep NTP through their
inherent model structure. By synthesizing insights across these methods, this
survey offers a taxonomy to guide research into models that address the known
limitations of token-level generation to develop new transformative models for
natural language processing.

*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Debiasing methods for LLMs can degrade cultural commonsense capabilities, with up to 75% accuracy deterioration, highlighting the need for methods that balance fairness and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous bias mitigation evaluations focused on general language understanding tasks unrelated to social biases, while cultural commonsense is closely related to social biases as both stem from social norms and values.

Method: Proposed SOBACO, a Japanese benchmark to evaluate social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs using a unified format, and tested several LLMs to examine debiasing effects.

Result: Debiasing methods significantly degraded LLM performance on cultural commonsense tasks, with up to 75% accuracy deterioration.

Conclusion: There is a critical need to develop debiasing methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve both fairness and utility of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases, prompting the development
of various debiasing methods. However, debiasing methods may degrade the
capabilities of LLMs. Previous research has evaluated the impact of bias
mitigation primarily through tasks measuring general language understanding,
which are often unrelated to social biases. In contrast, cultural commonsense
is closely related to social biases, as both are rooted in social norms and
values. The impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs has not
been well investigated. Considering this gap, we propose SOBACO (SOcial BiAs
and Cultural cOmmonsense benchmark), a Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate
social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs in a unified format. We evaluate
several LLMs on SOBACO to examine how debiasing methods affect cultural
commonsense in LLMs. Our results reveal that the debiasing methods degrade the
performance of the LLMs on the cultural commonsense task (up to 75% accuracy
deterioration). These results highlight the importance of developing debiasing
methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve
fairness and utility of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a novel alignment algorithm combining dynamic programming with beam search scoring to enable finer-grained error analysis in speech recognition by accurately aligning reference and model transcripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech recognition evaluation metrics like word error rate are dominated by frequent words with limited semantic weight, hiding important errors in rare terms, named entities, and domain-specific vocabulary that are more consequential.

Method: A novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam search scoring to provide more accurate alignment of individual errors compared to traditional text alignment methods.

Result: The approach enables reliable error analysis by providing more accurate alignment of individual errors between reference and model transcripts.

Conclusion: The proposed alignment algorithm addresses the need for finer-grained error analysis in speech recognition systems and is made available via PyPI for practical use.

Abstract: Modern neural networks have greatly improved performance across speech
recognition benchmarks. However, gains are often driven by frequent words with
limited semantic weight, which can obscure meaningful differences in word error
rate, the primary evaluation metric. Errors in rare terms, named entities, and
domain-specific vocabulary are more consequential, but remain hidden by
aggregate metrics. This highlights the need for finer-grained error analysis,
which depends on accurate alignment between reference and model transcripts.
However, conventional alignment methods are not designed for such precision. We
propose a novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam
search scoring. Compared to traditional text alignment methods, our approach
provides more accurate alignment of individual errors, enabling reliable error
analysis. The algorithm is made available via PyPI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-Sanitize is a novel LLM-driven framework that enables real-time monitoring and correction of harmful content generation in large language models through cognitive-inspired self-monitoring and self-repair mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mitigation strategies for harmful content in LLMs rely on post-hoc filtering, which introduces latency, computational overhead, and is incompatible with token-level streaming generation.

Method: Self-Sanitize uses a lightweight Self-Monitor module that continuously inspects high-level intentions via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place correction without separate review dialogues.

Result: Extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy leakage scenarios show superior mitigation performance with minimal overhead and no degradation of LLM utility.

Conclusion: Self-Sanitize offers a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments with real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair capabilities.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide
range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding
the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite
significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards,
adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses.
Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering,
which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is
incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce
Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive
psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during
conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that
continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level
via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place
correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues.
This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with
negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that
privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous
studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy
leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior
mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility
of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRPO-MA improves upon GRPO by generating multiple answers per thought process to address gradient coupling, sparse rewards, and unstable advantage estimation, leading to better performance and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three key challenges in GRPO: gradient coupling between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals from limited parallel sampling, and unstable advantage estimation.

Method: Propose GRPO-MA which leverages multi-answer generation from each thought process, theoretically reducing variance of thought advantage as number of answers increases.

Result: Empirical gradient analysis shows GRPO-MA reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and multimodal tasks demonstrate substantial performance improvements and training efficiency gains.

Conclusion: Increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model performance, making GRPO-MA a more robust and efficient optimization method for training reasoning in LLMs and VLMs.

Abstract: Recent progress, such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that the GRPO algorithm, a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, can effectively train Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling
between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel
sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we
propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages
multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and
efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought
advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases.
Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA
reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and
diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves
performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that
increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model
performance.

TL;DR: SUIT is a knowledge editing method that modifies only the critical feature subspace relevant to edits, reducing model perturbations while maintaining high edit efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing locate-then-edit methods without constraints on key and value vectors cause significant perturbations to edited models, leading to poor knowledge preservation.

Method: Identifies and modifies only the subspace of critical features relevant to the edit, rather than making unconstrained modifications to MLP layers.

Result: SUIT dramatically improves knowledge preservation over strong baselines while maintaining high edit efficacy on LLaMA-3-8B, GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models.

Conclusion: The method successfully identifies the critical subspace for edits, with additional analyses validating the approach.

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently correct factual errors in Language
Models (LMs). The popular locate-then-edit approach modifies an MLP layer by
finding an optimal mapping between its input vector (key) and output vector
(value) that leads to the expression of the edited knowledge. However, existing
methods without any constraints on the key and value vectors cause significant
perturbations to the edited model. To address this, we propose Subspace
Knowledge Edit (SUIT), a method that identifies and modifies only the subspace
of critical features relevant to the edit. Our empirical results on LLaMA-3-8B,
GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models show that SUIT dramatically improves knowledge
preservation over strong baselines while maintaining high edit efficacy. This
effectiveness confirms that SUIT successfully identifies the critical subspace
for the edit. Further analyses provide additional validation for our approach.
The source code and data will be released to the public upon publication of the
paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations lack grounding in real user contexts, especially in critical domains like healthcare where cultural practices and community needs are essential but often overlooked in standard benchmarks.

Method: Co-created a community-driven evaluation pipeline with civil-society organizations and community members, enabling automated benchmarking through culturally aware processes where community feedback guides what to evaluate, benchmark construction, and scoring.

Result: Demonstrated the approach in Indian healthcare, showing how current multilingual LLMs handle nuanced community health queries while providing a scalable method for contextually grounded LLM evaluation.

Conclusion: Samiksha offers a scalable pathway for inclusive, contextually grounded LLM evaluation that better reflects real community needs and cultural contexts, particularly in critical domains like healthcare.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated through general or
domain-specific benchmarks testing capabilities that often lack grounding in
the lived realities of end users. Critical domains such as healthcare require
evaluations that extend beyond artificial or simulated tasks to reflect the
everyday needs, cultural practices, and nuanced contexts of communities. We
propose Samiksha, a community-driven evaluation pipeline co-created with
civil-society organizations (CSOs) and community members. Our approach enables
scalable, automated benchmarking through a culturally aware, community-driven
pipeline in which community feedback informs what to evaluate, how the
benchmark is built, and how outputs are scored. We demonstrate this approach in
the health domain in India. Our analysis highlights how current multilingual
LLMs address nuanced community health queries, while also offering a scalable
pathway for contextually grounded and inclusive LLM evaluation.

*Shaohao Rui,Kaitao Chen,Weijie Ma,Xiaosong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaThink-Med is an end-to-end framework that enhances adaptive thinking in medical LLMs by using uncertainty-guided length calibration to reduce unnecessary reasoning for simple questions while maintaining thorough reasoning for complex ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical LLMs engage in lengthy reasoning regardless of question difficulty, increasing inference costs. Adaptive thinking where models think less for simple questions and more for complex ones is needed for practical medical applications.

Method: Generates multiple candidate outputs per question, evaluates correctness and uncertainty, estimates problem difficulty via uncertainty-guided length calibration, penalizes long reasoning for easy questions, and extends chain of thought for difficult questions.

Result: Achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average across six medical QA benchmarks while maintaining performance with minimal degradation, and spontaneously develops "non-thinking" and "thinking" reasoning modes.

Conclusion: AdaThink-Med effectively enables adaptive thinking in medical LLMs, dynamically suppressing redundant reasoning while preserving performance, making it suitable for real-world medical applications with computational constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought
have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and
medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in
lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question,
leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore,
enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and
think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs
in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches
designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while
providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and
computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first
end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical
reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first
generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the
correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem
difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs
with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer
reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers,
it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions.
On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length
reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation.
Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct
reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking",
demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes
dynamically.

Motivation: Traditional methods for studying dyslexia are limited in testing causal hypotheses about reading impairment mechanisms, so researchers turned to computational models to better understand the underlying causes.

Method: Identified visual-word-form-selective units in large-scale vision-language models and performed targeted ablation of these units, comparing effects against random unit ablation.

Result: Targeted ablation of word-form-selective units caused selective reading impairments while preserving general visual and language abilities, specifically matching dyslexic humans' phonological deficits without affecting orthographic processing.

Conclusion: The modeling approach successfully replicated key dyslexia characteristics and established a computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

Abstract: Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading
difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area
in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying
dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable
insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use
large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally
identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using
stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective
units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike
ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while
general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In
particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits
without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our
modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a
computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

*Gio Paik,Yongbeom Kim,Soungmin Lee,Sangmin Ahn,Chanwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiKE is the first Korean-English code-switching benchmark that provides hierarchical CS-level labels and enables systematic evaluation of multilingual ASR models' code-switching capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching remains an underexplored challenge in multilingual ASR despite being common in daily speech, and there was no globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS.

Method: Created HiKE benchmark with high-quality natural CS data across topics, meticulous loanword labels, and hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word, phrase, sentence) for systematic evaluation.

Result: Most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with CS-ASR, but this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data.

Conclusion: HiKE provides a means for precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and fosters research in Korean-English code-switching, demonstrating that fine-tuning with CS data enables CS-ASR capability.

Abstract: Despite advances in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR),
code-switching (CS), the mixing of languages within an utterance common in
daily speech, remains a severely underexplored challenge. In this paper, we
introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the
first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to
provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to
foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of
high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides
meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word,
phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's
ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of
diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper
demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with
CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data. HiKE
will be available at https://github.com/ThetaOne-AI/HiKE.

### [153] [Hype or not? Formalizing Automatic Promotional Language Detection in Biomedical Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24638)
*Bojan Batalo,Erica K. Shimomoto,Neil Millar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces automatic hype detection in scientific writing as an NLP task, creates annotation guidelines for hyperbolic language, builds a dataset from NIH grant applications, and evaluates ML models for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hype in scientific writing is increasing and can undermine objective evaluation of evidence, impede research development, and erode trust in science.

Method: Proposed formalized guidelines for identifying hype language, annotated NIH grant application corpus, evaluated traditional text classifiers and language models, compared with human baseline.

Result: Formalizing annotation guidelines helps humans reliably annotate hype adjectives, and training ML models on the annotated dataset yields promising results. The task shows linguistic complexity requiring domain knowledge and temporal awareness.

Conclusion: This is the first approach to hype detection as an NLP task, demonstrating the feasibility of automatic detection while highlighting the need for contextual understanding in identifying hyperbolic scientific language.

Abstract: In science, promotional language ('hype') is increasing and can undermine
objective evaluation of evidence, impede research development, and erode trust
in science. In this paper, we introduce the task of automatic detection of
hype, which we define as hyperbolic or subjective language that authors use to
glamorize, promote, embellish, or exaggerate aspects of their research. We
propose formalized guidelines for identifying hype language and apply them to
annotate a portion of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant application
corpus. We then evaluate traditional text classifiers and language models on
this task, comparing their performance with a human baseline. Our experiments
show that formalizing annotation guidelines can help humans reliably annotate
candidate hype adjectives and that using our annotated dataset to train machine
learning models yields promising results. Our findings highlight the linguistic
complexity of the task, and the potential need for domain knowledge and
temporal awareness of the facts. While some linguistic works address hype
detection, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach it as a
natural language processing task.

*Weilin Zhao,Zihan Zhou,Zhou Su,Chaojun Xiao,Yuxuan Li,Yanghao Li,Yudi Zhang,Weilun Zhao,Zhen Li,Yuxiang Huang,Ao Sun,Xu Han,Zhiyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention framework that enables efficient long-sequence processing by reusing dense attention parameters and switching between dense and sparse attention based on sequence length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention in Transformers has computational bottlenecks for long sequences, and existing sparse attention methods introduce excessive parameters and disrupt the pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long workflow.

Method: Parameter-free architecture modification that reuses dense attention parameters, with dense attention for short sequences and smooth transition to sparse attention for long sequences, plus an efficient implementation to reduce computational overhead.

Result: 4x faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% performance on long-context understanding and 99.7% on chain-of-thought reasoning.

Conclusion: InfLLM-V2 provides an effective solution for long-sequence processing with practical acceleration, demonstrated through the open-sourced MiniCPM4.1 model.

Abstract: Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language
models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer
architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing
long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising
solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters
and disrupt the conventional \textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long}
workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention
framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that
seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2
reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture
modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence
processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all
sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly
transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical
acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2
that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on
long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that
InfLLM-V2 is 4$\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and
99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we
have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1
(https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model,
providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

### [155] [Understanding the Dilemma of Unlearning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24675)
*Qingjie Zhang,Haoting Qian,Zhicong Huang,Cheng Hong,Minlie Huang,Ke Xu,Chao Zhang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Unlearning in LLMs is ineffective - knowledge can be recovered through keyword emphasis, and methods either fail to erase knowledge or cause catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms of unlearning in LLMs and address the gap in interpretability analyses due to the complexity of tracing knowledge in LLM architectures.

Method: Proposed unPact framework that quantifies each prompt token's influence on outputs through prompt attribution and contribution tracking, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons.

Result: Found that unlearning works by disrupting keyword focus, knowledge remains recoverable via keyword emphasis without weight modification, and catastrophic forgetting comes from indiscriminate token penalization.

Conclusion: Existing unlearning methods face a dilemma: either insufficient (knowledge recoverable) or overly destructive (performance collapse), leaving a gap to reliable unlearning.

Abstract: Unlearning seeks to remove specific knowledge from large language models
(LLMs), but its effectiveness remains contested. On one side, "forgotten"
knowledge can often be recovered through interventions such as light
fine-tuning; on the other side, unlearning may induce catastrophic forgetting
that degrades general capabilities. Despite active exploration of unlearning
methods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the
difficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this
gap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt
attribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt
token's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to
reveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and
three benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by
disrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly
erased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts,
without modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from
indiscriminate penalization of all tokens. Taken together, our results suggest
an unlearning dilemma: existing methods tend either to be insufficient -
knowledge remains recoverable by keyword emphasis, or overly destructive -
general performance collapses due to catastrophic forgetting, still leaving a
gap to reliable unlearning.

*Leander Girrbach,Chi-Ping Su,Tankred Saanum,Richard Socher,Eric Schulz,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies the reliability of single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references, identifies systematic issues with standard prompting methods, and proposes Latent Judges that derive scalar ratings from internal model signals for more reliable evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings, which suffer from instability under sampling, poor calibration, score compression near the top scale, and frequent ties in standard prompting approaches.

Method: Proposes Latent Judges that derive scalar ratings from three types of internal model signals: (1) probability-weighted scores over integer ratings, (2) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and (3) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position.

Result: Across various pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and listwise ranking. Probability-weighted scores achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful signals when output logits are miscalibrated.

Conclusion: Latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches like Best-of-N, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

Abstract: How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references,
and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study
the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to
free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under
sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the
scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which
derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted
scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and
(iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across
a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or
surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and
listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores
achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful
signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that
latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for
reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches
like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

*Guibin Zhang,Muxin Fu,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemGen is a dynamic generative memory framework that enables LLM agents to interweave memory and reasoning through latent token sequences, achieving superior performance over existing memory systems and exhibiting emergent human-like memory faculties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory paradigms for LLM agents are constrained - parametric memory forcibly adjusts model parameters and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience into databases, neither capturing the fluid interweaving of reasoning and memory that characterizes human cognition.

Method: MemGen consists of a memory trigger that monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and a memory weaver that takes the agent's current state as stimulus to construct latent token sequences as machine-native memory to enrich reasoning.

Result: MemGen surpasses leading external memory systems (ExpeL, AWM) by up to 38.22%, exceeds GRPO by up to 13.44%, and exhibits strong cross-domain generalization. It spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties including planning, procedural, and working memory without explicit supervision.

Conclusion: MemGen enables a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and cognition in LLM agents, suggesting an emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition through dynamic generative memory.

Abstract: Agent memory shapes how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, akin to
the human brain, progressively refine themselves through environment
interactions. Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly
adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience
into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of
reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we
propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a
human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \textit{memory trigger}, which
monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and
a \textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to
construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its
reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent
memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and
cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen
surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to
$38.22\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit
supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties,
including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an
emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.

*Shaobo Wang,Zhengbo Jiao,Zifan Zhang,Yilang Peng,Xu Ze,Boyu Yang,Wei Wang,Hu Wei,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Socratic-Zero is an autonomous framework that generates high-quality training data from minimal seed examples through co-evolution of three agents, achieving significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks without requiring pre-existing tasks or labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for data synthesis struggle with inconsistent quality and inability to adapt to evolving model capabilities, creating suboptimal training signals. There's a need for scalable, autonomous data generation that can dynamically adjust to model needs.

Method: Co-evolution of three agents: Teacher (creates challenging questions), Solver (refines reasoning from feedback), and Generator (distills question-design strategy). This closed-loop system produces self-improving curriculum from only 100 seed questions.

Result: Socratic-Solver-8B achieves +20.2 percentage point average gain over prior methods across 7 mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Synthetic data from Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to outperform SOTA commercial models including Qwen3-235B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, and others.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that fully autonomous data generation through agent co-evolution can produce high-quality training data that significantly outperforms existing methods and even commercial SOTA models, requiring minimal initial input.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks rely
heavily on massive, high-quality datasets-typically human-annotated and thus
difficult to scale. While data synthesis or distillation offers a promising
alternative, existing methods struggle with inconsistent data quality and an
inability to dynamically adapt to the evolving capabilities of the model,
leading to suboptimal training signals. To address these limitations, we
introduce Socratic-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
high-quality training data from minimal seed examples through the co-evolution
of three agents: the Teacher, the Solver, and the Generator. The Solver
continuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both
successful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly
challenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator
distills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable,
high-fidelity curriculum generation. This closed-loop system produces a
self-improving curriculum-requiring no pre-existing tasks or labels.
Remarkably, starting from only 100 seed questions, our Socratic-Solver-8B
achieves an average gain of +20.2 percentage points over prior data synthesis
methods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24-25,
Olympiad, MATH-500, Minerva, and GSM8K), with consistent gains on both Qwen3
and GLM4 series models. Even more surprisingly, synthetic data from
Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to achieve superior performance
compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial LLMs on these benchmarks,
including Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4,
and Claude-4.1-Opus.

*Yixuan Wang,Huang He,Siqi Bao,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProxyAttn is a training-free sparse attention algorithm that improves block importance estimation by compressing attention head dimensions and using representative proxy heads, achieving up to 10.3x attention acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits LLM efficiency on long-text tasks. Existing methods that dynamically estimate block importance enable efficient block sparse attention but suffer from coarse-grained estimation that causes performance degradation at high sparsity rates.

Method: ProxyAttn compresses attention head dimensions and uses scores from pooled representative heads to approximate all heads' scores, leveraging observed similarity among attention heads. It also includes a block-aware dynamic budget estimation method to account for varying sparsity among heads.

Result: Experiments confirm similarity among attention heads. ProxyAttn achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to existing methods, with up to 10.3x attention acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance loss.

Conclusion: The proposed ProxyAttn method enables more fine-grained block importance evaluation at low computational cost, effectively addressing the limitations of existing sparse attention methods while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits the efficiency of
Large Language Models (LLMs) on long-text tasks. Recently, methods that
dynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse
attention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of
LLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance
degradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a
training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block
estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our
observation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores
of pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To
account for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware
dynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative
proxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained
block importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety
of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity
among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed
method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to
existing methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention
acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance
loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/wyxstriker/ProxyAttn.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LatentEvolve is a self-evolving test-time scaling framework that enables LLMs to progressively learn how to scale computation more effectively through daytime and nighttime evolutionary processes inspired by human cognitive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods are independent and don't allow LLMs to progressively learn better scaling strategies. The goal is to evolve LLMs to learn "how to scale test-time computation" more effectively.

Method: LatentEvolve uses a dual evolutionary system: daytime scaling rapidly retrieves historical latent representations to guide current reasoning, while nighttime scaling integrates past latent optimizations through consolidation, mimicking human cognitive processes in an unsupervised manner.

Result: Extensive experiments across 8 benchmarks and 5 model backbones show LatentEvolve outperforms state-of-the-art TTS methods like LatentSeek and TTRL by up to 13.33%, with exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables LLMs to progressively learn better test-time scaling strategies through biologically-inspired evolutionary processes, achieving superior performance and generalization compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Test-time Scaling (TTS) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the inference
phase without altering model parameters. However, existing TTS methods are
largely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively
learn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to
learn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a
self-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning
system (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a
fast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve
comprises two evolutionary components: \textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly
retrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM
reasoning; and \textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent
optimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of
experiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes
facilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive
dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses
state-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\%$ and
exhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeaPO is a Strategic Error Amplification method that introduces specific error patterns into preference optimization to ensure negative samples are more erroneous than positive samples, enhancing model performance particularly in truthfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods struggle when positive and negative samples become similar in quality during training, complicating preference learning optimization.

Method: Leverages three common LLM error types to introduce specific error patterns into preference optimization, ensuring negative samples are more erroneous than positive samples.

Result: Evaluations across five capability dimensions and model scales (1.5B to 14B) show significant performance improvements, particularly 5-10 percentage points in truthfulness. Task performance varies by error type introduced.

Conclusion: Strategic error amplification effectively enhances model performance, with different error types improving related tasks and mixed errors providing broader performance enhancement.

Abstract: Existing alignment methods for preference optimization of large language
models (LLMs) aim to enhance model performance by utilizing pairs of positive
and negative samples. However, due to the limited capacity of models in scoring
or generating responses, the quality of positive and negative samples may
become similar during training, which complicates optimization for preference
learning. To address this issue, we introduce SeaPO, a Strategic Error
Amplification method that leverages three error types commonly occurring in
LLMs to introduce specific error patterns into the model Preference
Optimization. This strategy ensures that negative samples are more erroneous
than positive samples and preference-based training is employed to mitigate the
occurrence of these errors, thereby enhancing model performance. Evaluations
across five capability dimensions and different model scales (1.5B to 14B)
demonstrate that the generated data significantly improved overall model
performance, particularly in terms of truthfulness, with improvements of 5-10
percentage points observed. Further analysis reveals that task performance
varies depending on the error types introduced. Injecting the most common error
types improves performance in related tasks, while a mix of error types leads
to a broader performance enhancement: most tasks show stable improvements,
while a few tasks exhibit significant gains.

TL;DR: Proposes a tree-based evaluation metric for LLM-generated assembly instructions that better captures spatiotemporal aspects than traditional text similarity metrics like BLEU and BERT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like BLEU and BERT similarity scores fail to adequately reflect spatiotemporal aspects of construction in step-by-step assembly instructions, particularly in domains like sewing.

Method: Developed a novel automatic tree-based evaluation metric specifically designed for LLM-generated step-by-step assembly instructions, focusing on spatiotemporal soundness.

Result: The proposed metric shows better correlation with manually-annotated error counts and human quality ratings, and is more robust against artificially-constructed counterfactual examples designed to confound text similarity metrics.

Conclusion: The tree-based metric is superior to traditional approaches for evaluating the spatiotemporal soundness of sewing instructions and demonstrates greater robustness against adversarial examples.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel, automatic tree-based evaluation metric for
LLM-generated step-by-step assembly instructions, that more accurately reflects
spatiotemporal aspects of construction than traditional metrics such as BLEU
and BERT similarity scores. We apply our proposed metric to the domain of
sewing instructions, and show that our metric better correlates with
manually-annotated error counts as well as human quality ratings, demonstrating
our metric's superiority for evaluating the spatiotemporal soundness of sewing
instructions. Further experiments show that our metric is more robust than
traditional approaches against artificially-constructed counterfactual examples
that are specifically constructed to confound metrics that rely on textual
similarity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KnowGuard is a novel "investigate-before-abstain" paradigm that improves LLM abstention in medical diagnosis by systematically exploring knowledge graphs to identify when information is insufficient, rather than relying solely on model self-assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with abstention in medical scenarios, often providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information, which poses safety risks. Existing methods rely only on model self-assessments without systematic strategies to identify knowledge boundaries using external medical evidence.

Method: A two-stage approach: 1) Evidence discovery through systematic knowledge graph exploration (graph expansion and direct retrieval), and 2) Evidence evaluation that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt exploration based on patient context and conversation history. Both stages operate on a shared contextualized evidence pool.

Result: KnowGuard outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic accuracy by 3.93% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on average in open-ended multi-round clinical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The investigate-before-abstain paradigm with systematic knowledge graph exploration enables models to better recognize insufficient medical evidence and make safer clinical decisions, addressing critical limitations in current LLM abstention methods.

Abstract: In clinical practice, physicians refrain from making decisions when patient
information is insufficient. This behavior, known as abstention, is a critical
safety mechanism preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses. Recent
investigations have reported the application of large language models (LLMs) in
medical scenarios. However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions,
frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information.
This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on
model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge
boundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose
\textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that
integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making.
Our approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized
evidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the
medical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an
evidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt
exploration based on patient context and conversation history. This two-stage
approach enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to
trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence.
We evaluate our abstention approach using open-ended multi-round clinical
benchmarks that mimic realistic diagnostic scenarios, assessing abstention
quality through accuracy-efficiency trade-offs beyond existing closed-form
evaluations. Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard
outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic
accuracy by 3.93\% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on
average.

TL;DR: DiaCDM is the first model to perform cognitive diagnosis in teacher-student dialogues, using an adapted IRE framework and graph-based encoding to overcome challenges of unstructured dialogue data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cognitive diagnosis models are designed for structured test data and cannot handle dynamic, unstructured teacher-student dialogues, making it difficult to extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy conversations.

Method: Adapted the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory and developed a unique graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant knowledge components to capture key diagnostic information.

Result: Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets show that DiaCDM significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and enhances result interpretability compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: DiaCDM provides teachers with a powerful tool for assessing students' cognitive states in dialogue settings, marking the first successful application of cognitive diagnosis to unstructured dialogue data.

Abstract: While cognitive diagnosis (CD) effectively assesses students' knowledge
mastery from structured test data, applying it to real-world teacher-student
dialogues presents two fundamental challenges. Traditional CD models lack a
suitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's
difficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To
overcome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted
the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to
design a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique
graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant
knowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our
knowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue
setting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM
not only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the
results' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for
assessing students' cognitive states. The code is available at

### [165] [SemShareKV: Efficient KVCache Sharing for Semantically Similar Prompts via Token-Level LSH Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24832)
*Xinye Zhao,Spyridon Mastorakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemShareKV is a KV cache sharing framework that accelerates LLM inference by reusing key-value caches in semantically similar prompts using fuzzy token matching with LSH and RoPE, achieving up to 6.25x speedup and 42% memory reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The memory footprint of KV caches during LLM inference has become a bottleneck, and existing compression approaches are limited in handling semantically similar but lexically different prompts common in tasks like multi-document summarization and conversational agents.

Method: Uses fuzzy token matching with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to preserve positional information, selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from reference prompts' caches.

Result: Achieves up to 6.25x speedup and 42% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input on diverse summarization datasets, with negligible quality degradation.

Conclusion: Semantic-aware cache sharing shows significant potential for efficient LLM inference by reducing redundant computation while maintaining output quality.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of
key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck.
Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single
prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across
prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are
semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks
such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose
\textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that
accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts.
Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token
matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and
incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional
information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference
prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining
output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to
6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with
negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of
semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

### [166] [Hierarchical Error Correction for Large Language Models: A Systematic Framework for Domain-Specific AI Quality Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24841)
*Zhilong Zhao,Yindi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC) framework to improve LLM performance in specialized domains by systematically analyzing and correcting hierarchical error patterns (Knowledge: 58.4%, Reasoning: 39.6%, Complexity: 2.0%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform poorly in specialized domains (only 45.9% accuracy on medical coding), requiring targeted intervention strategies to address domain-specific limitations.

Method: Three-stage correction framework based on hierarchical error analysis across four domains (medical, legal, political, legal reasoning), validated across five LLM architectures.

Result: Average improvement of 11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001) across domains, but framework effectiveness decreases for high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy) where intervention may interfere with reasoning.

Conclusion: Systematic error analysis enables effective AI enhancement in specialized domains, particularly for moderate-baseline tasks, while understanding framework boundaries is crucial for optimal deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized
domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical
coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC)
framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic
error analysis and targeted intervention strategies.
  We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI
errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors
(58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%).
Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that
addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates
that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task
performance.
  Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal
document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases),
and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model
validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of
11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework
limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical
intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes.
  The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI
enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for
moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding
framework boundaries for optimal deployment.

### [167] [Between Help and Harm: An Evaluation of Mental Health Crisis Handling by LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24857)
*Adrian Arnaiz-Rodriguez,Miguel Baidal,Erik Derner,Jenn Layton Annable,Mark Ball,Mark Ince,Elvira Perez Vallejos,Nuria Oliver*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs' ability to handle mental health crises, finding they're generally reliable for explicit disclosures but have significant risks including inappropriate responses, poor handling of indirect signals, and formulaic replies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes mental health contexts, but their ability to safely detect and respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood due to lack of unified taxonomies, benchmarks, and clinical evaluations.

Method: Introduced a unified taxonomy of six clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curated a diverse evaluation dataset, established expert-designed assessment protocols, and systematically benchmarked three state-of-the-art LLMs for crisis classification and response generation.

Result: LLMs showed high consistency and general reliability for explicit crisis disclosures, but significant risks remained: non-negligible inappropriate/harmful responses, higher failure rates in open-weight models, systemic weaknesses with indirect risk signals, formulaic replies, and context misalignment.

Conclusion: Urgent need for enhanced safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM deployments. The taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework provide groundwork for responsible AI-driven mental health support innovation.

Abstract: The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such
as ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and
advice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in
high-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns.
While LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and
respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is
hampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated
benchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In
this work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six
clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse
evaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing
response appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art
LLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate
responses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and
generally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks
remain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or
harmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher
failure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify
systemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance
on formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with
user context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced
safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM
deployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the
groundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental
health support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users.

### [168] [Metaphor identification using large language models: A comparison of RAG, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24866)
*Matteo Fuoli,Weihang Huang,Jeannette Littlemore,Sarah Turner,Ellen Wilding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores using large language models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in texts, comparing three methods: retrieval-augmented generation, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning, with fine-tuning achieving the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metaphor analysis is important for understanding cognition, emotion, and ideology, but large-scale analysis has been limited by the need for manual annotation due to metaphor's context-sensitive nature.

Method: Three approaches were compared: (1) retrieval-augmented generation with codebook instructions, (2) prompt engineering with zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies, and (3) fine-tuning on hand-coded texts.

Result: State-of-the-art closed-source LLMs achieved high accuracy, with fine-tuning yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. Discrepancies between human and LLM outputs were systematic and reflected known challenges in metaphor theory.

Conclusion: LLMs can partly automate metaphor identification and serve as a testbed for developing metaphor identification protocols and refining metaphor theory.

Abstract: Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for
examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has
been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive
nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare
three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is
provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules
and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal
instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded
texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot,
few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that
state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning
yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs
reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey
areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be
used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a
testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the
theory that underpins them.

### [169] [Expanding Computation Spaces of LLMs at Inference Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24884)
*Yoonna Jang,Kisu Yang,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models can use artificially inserted filler tokens at inference to expand computational space, improving performance especially for smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models can leverage artificially inserted filler tokens solely at inference time as additional computation space, building on prior work that trained such tokens.

Method: Identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations; examine when models learn to use expanded computation space during training; analyze attention dynamics within these spaces using attention maps.

Result: Appropriate token types and counts vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is most effective. Smaller models benefit most (up to 12.372 percentage points improvement), indicating these spaces act as additional computational capacity. Attention maps show expanded spaces continue original attention mechanisms and focus on questions/answer options.

Conclusion: Artificially inserted filler tokens at inference provide meaningful additional computational capacity for language models, particularly benefiting smaller models, with attention patterns suggesting genuine problem-solving computation.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationale enables language models to use additional
task-related text for problem-solving, benefiting not only from detailed
reasoning steps but also from the expanded computational space of longer
inputs. Prior work has trained filler or special tokens to serve as additional
computation spaces. In this study, we investigate whether language models can
leverage artificially inserted sequences of filler tokens solely at inference.
We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then
examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded
computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via
attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across
open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts
vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is
most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in
SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional
computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that
expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes
focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for
problem-solving.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BOE-XSUM is a new dataset of 3,648 Spanish legal document summaries from Spain's State Official Gazette, with fine-tuned LLMs showing significant performance gains over zero-shot models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of concise Spanish document summaries, particularly in the legal domain, to combat information overload.

Method: Created BOE-XSUM dataset with document-summary pairs, then fine-tuned medium-sized LLMs and compared them to zero-shot general-purpose models.

Result: Fine-tuned models significantly outperformed zero-shot models, with BERTIN GPT-J 6B achieving 41.6% accuracy vs 33.5% for DeepSeek-R1 - a 24% performance gain.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning specialized models on domain-specific datasets like BOE-XSUM yields substantial improvements over general-purpose models for Spanish legal document summarization.

Abstract: The ability to summarize long documents succinctly is increasingly important
in daily life due to information overload, yet there is a notable lack of such
summaries for Spanish documents in general, and in the legal domain in
particular. In this work, we present BOE-XSUM, a curated dataset comprising
3,648 concise, plain-language summaries of documents sourced from Spain's
``Bolet\'{\i}n Oficial del Estado'' (BOE), the State Official Gazette. Each
entry in the dataset includes a short summary, the original text, and its
document type label. We evaluate the performance of medium-sized large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuned on BOE-XSUM, comparing them to general-purpose
generative models in a zero-shot setting. Results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their non-specialized counterparts. Notably, the
best-performing model -- BERTIN GPT-J 6B (32-bit precision) -- achieves a 24\%
performance gain over the top zero-shot model, DeepSeek-R1 (accuracies of
41.6\% vs.\ 33.5\%).

### [171] [How Well Do LLMs Imitate Human Writing Style?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24930)
*Rebira Jemama,Rajesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free framework for authorship verification and style imitation analysis that combines TF-IDF character n-grams with transformer embeddings, achieving high accuracy while significantly reducing computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs can effectively replicate specific human author styles and develop an efficient method for authorship verification without requiring supervised training.

Method: Integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance distributions, eliminating need for supervised training or threshold tuning. Evaluates LLMs across different prompting strategies.

Result: Achieves 97.5% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5% in cross-domain evaluation, with 91.8% reduction in training time and 59% memory usage reduction. Few-shot prompting yields 23.5x higher style-matching than zero-shot, and completion prompting reaches 99.9% agreement with original author style.

Conclusion: Prompting strategy has greater influence on style fidelity than model size, and high-fidelity imitation doesn't imply human-like unpredictability - stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are separable, providing basis for future authorship work.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, but their ability to
replicate the distinctive style of a specific human author remains unclear. We
present a fast, training-free framework for authorship verification and style
imitation analysis. The method integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with
transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance
distributions, eliminating the need for supervised training or threshold
tuning. It achieves 97.5\% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5\% in
cross-domain evaluation, while reducing training time by 91.8\% and memory
usage by 59\% relative to parameter-based baselines. Using this framework, we
evaluate five LLMs from three separate families (Llama, Qwen, Mixtral) across
four prompting strategies - zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion.
Results show that the prompting strategy has a more substantial influence on
style fidelity than model size: few-shot prompting yields up to 23.5x higher
style-matching accuracy than zero-shot, and completion prompting reaches 99.9\%
agreement with the original author's style. Crucially, high-fidelity imitation
does not imply human-like unpredictability - human essays average a perplexity
of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings
demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are
separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship
modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation.

*Changsheng Zhao,Ernie Chang,Zechun Liu,Chia-Jung Chang,Wei Wen,Chen Lai,Rick Cao,Yuandong Tian,Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi,Yangyang Shi,Vikas Chandra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that reasoning in LLMs requires massive training data, showing that high-quality data curation enables strong reasoning with only ~2T tokens instead of >10T tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question the prevailing assumption that reasoning capabilities in LLMs require training on massive datasets (>10T tokens), and demonstrate that careful data curation can achieve similar results with much less data.

Method: Carefully curate and resample open-source datasets using designed metrics to identify beneficial data, then pre-train on 4.2T tokens from these ~2T high-quality tokens, followed by established post-training procedures.

Result: MobileLLM-R1 series (sub-billion parameters) substantially outperform prior models - MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves AIME score of 15.5 vs 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B, matching/surpassing Qwen3-0.6B while using only 11.7% of its tokens.

Conclusion: Strong reasoning abilities can emerge with far less data than previously assumed through careful data curation and quality-focused training, challenging the necessity of massive corpora for reasoning emergence in LLMs.

Abstract: The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses
to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1)
reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such
capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption
has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models
such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely
unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely
large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and
resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our
designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge
with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality
data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled
from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure,
enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter
reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully
open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of
15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B.
Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to
Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches
or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate
further research in this direction, we have released the complete training
recipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with
the key insights obtained throughout this study.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAQuE is the largest benchmark for evaluating medical multi-turn questioning AI, featuring 3,000 realistic patient agents with diverse behaviors and a comprehensive evaluation framework covering multiple aspects of medical dialogue quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI doctors focus mainly on diagnostic skills and information-seeking through inquiry, but overlook other essential physician qualities like empathy, communication, and patient interaction. There's a need for comprehensive evaluation of medical questioning capabilities.

Method: Created MAQuE benchmark with 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents exhibiting diverse linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and passive disclosure tendencies. Introduced multi-faceted evaluation framework covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry efficiency, and patient experience.

Result: Experiments on different LLMs revealed substantial challenges across all evaluation aspects. State-of-the-art models show significant room for improvement in inquiry capabilities, are highly sensitive to realistic patient behavior variations, and exhibit trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives.

Conclusion: The benchmark exposes the difficulty of balancing performance and practicality in real-world clinical settings, highlighting that current medical AI models need substantial improvement in comprehensive questioning capabilities beyond just diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: An effective physician should possess a combination of empathy, expertise,
patience, and clear communication when treating a patient. Recent advances have
successfully endowed AI doctors with expert diagnostic skills, particularly the
ability to actively seek information through inquiry. However, other essential
qualities of a good doctor remain overlooked. To bridge this gap, we present
MAQuE(Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation), the largest-ever benchmark for the
automatic and comprehensive evaluation of medical multi-turn questioning. It
features 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents that exhibit diverse
linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and tendencies
for passive disclosure. We also introduce a multi-faceted evaluation framework,
covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry
efficiency, and patient experience. Experiments on different LLMs reveal
substantial challenges across the evaluation aspects. Even state-of-the-art
models show significant room for improvement in their inquiry capabilities.
These models are highly sensitive to variations in realistic patient behavior,
which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, our fine-grained
metrics expose trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives,
highlighting the challenge of balancing performance and practicality in
real-world clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemanticShield is a two-stage framework that detects shilling attacks in recommender systems by integrating item-side semantics through LLMs, showing strong performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommender system defenses focus on user behaviors but overlook item-side features like titles and descriptions that can reveal malicious intent in shilling attacks.

Method: Two-stage detection: first pre-screens suspicious users with behavioral criteria, then uses LLM-based auditing for semantic consistency. Enhanced through reinforcement fine-tuning on lightweight LLM with specialized reward functions.

Result: Experiments on six attack strategies demonstrate effectiveness against shilling attacks. Further evaluation shows strong generalization capability on unseen attack methods.

Conclusion: SemanticShield effectively addresses the gap in shilling attack detection by leveraging item-side semantics through LLMs, providing robust defense with good generalization across various attack strategies.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce for personalized
suggestions, yet their openness makes them susceptible to shilling attacks,
where adversaries inject fake behaviors to manipulate recommendations. Most
existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side
features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To
address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates
item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage
pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second
stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore,
we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a
lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a
specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative
attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against
shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods
shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at

*Hanqi Xiao,Vaidehi Patil,Hyunji Lee,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs cannot reliably predict their own answer correctness better than unrelated LLMs. Training Generalized Correctness Models (GCMs) on historical correctness data from multiple LLMs enables accurate confidence estimation across models and datasets, showing that reliable confidence estimation comes from systematic encoding of correctness history rather than model self-introspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate confidence estimation is critical for deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications, but current approaches framing confidence as 'self-knowledge' fail because LLMs cannot reliably judge their own answer correctness better than unrelated models.

Method: Propose Generalized Correctness Models (GCMs) trained on historical correctness data from multiple LLMs. Methods include training on cross-model correctness patterns, using answer phrasing as predictor, in-context history examples, and post-hoc calibration.

Result: GCMs based on Qwen3-8B achieve reliable confidence estimation across 5 model families and datasets (MMLU, TriviaQA), showing generalizable performance. Answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness, and historical context improves prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Reliable LLM confidence estimation is a generalizable, model-agnostic skill learned through systematic encoding of correctness history, not a model-specific skill dependent on self-introspection.

Abstract: Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open
challenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting
a model's "self-knowledge", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its
own answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some
privileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the
model itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict
the correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an
unrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a
"Correctness Model" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical
predictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness
information, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that
GCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns
for correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use
CMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its
generalization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that
answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore
alternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that
including history as in-context examples can help improve correctness
prediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in
calibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families
and the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective
prediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a
generalizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding
correctness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on
self-introspection.

TL;DR: Circuit distillation aligns internal representations between teacher and student models to transfer computational mechanisms, outperforming standard behavioral mimicry distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard model distillation treats teacher's internal computations as a black box and focuses only on output mimicry, which may not effectively transfer underlying algorithmic capabilities.

Method: Proposes circuit distillation with an objective to align internal representations between functionally correspondent circuit components in teacher and student models, using a loss that reflects similarities between these representations.

Result: Circuit distillation outperforms standard distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind tasks using Llama3 models, successfully transferring algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of parameters.

Conclusion: Circuit distillation establishes the feasibility of transferring computational mechanisms, enabling efficient distillation of targeted teacher capabilities through interpretable and controllable internal student mechanisms.

Abstract: Model distillation typically focuses on behavioral mimicry, where a student
model is trained to replicate a teacher's output while treating its internal
computations as a black box. In this work we propose an alternative approach:
Distilling the underlying computational mechanisms implemented by a teacher
model. Specifically, we propose circuit distillation, which introduces an
objective to align internal representations between analogous circuit
components in teacher and student models. We propose a method to match
``functionally correspondent'' circuit components and introduce a loss
reflecting similarities between the representations that these induce. We
evaluate circuit distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind (ToM) tasks
using models from the Llama3 family. Our results demonstrate that circuit
distillation outperforms standard distillation, successfully transferring
algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of student
model parameters. This work establishes the feasibility of transferring
mechanisms, which may in turn allow for efficient distillation of targeted
teacher capabilities via interpretable and controllable internal student
mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast language generation is a key goal in AI, and current methods need acceleration while preserving quality.

Method: Uses discrete diffusion divergence instruction with techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state matching, and reward-guided ancestral sampler.

Conclusion: DiDi-Instruct is an efficient distillation method that enables fast language generation with minimal quality loss.

Abstract: Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the
AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct
(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation
models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language
model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM
counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical
part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of
integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We
also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state
matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly
improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference
performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated
language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard
dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128
NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss
of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further
validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive
ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein
sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective
distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We
will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

*Adamu Lawan,Haruna Yunusa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GateMABSA is a novel gated multimodal architecture for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis that uses three specialized mLSTMs to handle syntactic structure, semantic relevance, and selective multimodal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Twitter datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal ABSA models struggle with filtering noisy visual signals and effectively aligning aspects with opinion-bearing content across text and image modalities.

Method: Proposes GateMABSA with three specialized mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM for syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM for aspect-semantic relevance, and Fuse-mLSTM for selective multimodal fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark Twitter datasets demonstrate that GateMABSA outperforms several baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed gated multimodal architecture effectively addresses the challenges of noisy visual signals and cross-modal alignment in multimodal ABSA.

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has recently advanced into the
multimodal domain, where user-generated content often combines text and images.
However, existing multimodal ABSA (MABSA) models struggle to filter noisy
visual signals, and effectively align aspects with opinion-bearing content
across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GateMABSA, a novel
gated multimodal architecture that integrates syntactic, semantic, and
fusion-aware mLSTM. Specifically, GateMABSA introduces three specialized
mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM to incorporate syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM to emphasize
aspect--semantic relevance, and Fuse-mLSTM to perform selective multimodal
fusion. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Twitter datasets demonstrate
that GateMABSA outperforms several baselines.

*Marco Bronzini,Carlo Nicolini,Bruno Lepri,Jacopo Staiano,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hyperdimensional Probe is a novel method that combines symbolic representations and neural probing to decode interpretable concepts from LLM vector spaces using Vector Symbolic Architectures, overcoming limitations of existing interpretability methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM interpretability methods like direct logit attribution and sparse autoencoders provide limited insight due to vocabulary constraints and unclear feature names, creating a need for better decoding of internal representations.

Method: Projects the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via Vector Symbolic Architectures, combining strengths of sparse autoencoders and conventional probes while overcoming their limitations.

Result: The probe reliably extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input domains, including syntactic pattern recognition, key-value associations, abstract inference, and question-answering settings.

Conclusion: This work advances information decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extraction of more informative, interpretable, and structured features from neural representations, and helps identify LLM failures.

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with
limited understanding of their internal representations. Current
interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the
model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces
Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM
vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural
probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via
Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs
and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our
decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's
final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern
recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess
it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both
before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably
extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input
domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information
decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative,
interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes confidence-informed prompting for LLM-based ASR error correction, embedding word-level uncertainty estimates into training to improve robustness for disordered speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction for disordered speech using large language models (LLMs) as post-processing modules, addressing the challenge of robustness across different speakers and datasets.

Method: Proposed confidence-informed prompting where word-level uncertainty estimates from ASR are embedded directly into LLM training. Fine-tuned a LLaMA 3.1 model and compared with transcript-only fine-tuning and post hoc confidence-based filtering.

Result: Achieved 10% relative WER reduction on Speech Accessibility Project spontaneous speech and 47% reduction on TORGO dataset compared to naive LLM correction.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware fine-tuning is effective for impaired speech ASR correction, reducing overcorrection and improving generalization across speakers and datasets.

Abstract: We investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) as post-processing
modules for automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on their ability to
perform error correction for disordered speech. In particular, we propose
confidence-informed prompting, where word-level uncertainty estimates are
embedded directly into LLM training to improve robustness and generalization
across speakers and datasets. This approach directs the model to uncertain ASR
regions and reduces overcorrection. We fine-tune a LLaMA 3.1 model and compare
our approach to both transcript-only fine-tuning and post hoc confidence-based
filtering. Evaluations show that our method achieves a 10% relative WER
reduction compared to naive LLM correction on the Speech Accessibility Project
spontaneous speech and a 47% reduction on TORGO, demonstrating the
effectiveness of confidence-aware fine-tuning for impaired speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study Transformers on program trace generation, which externalizes reasoning through long execution traces where each step is trivial, unlike existing algorithmic problems.

Method: Train small Transformers with diverse modifications including alternative position encodings, softmax replacements, hybrid models, and short convolutions on the program trace generation task.

Result: Models achieve strong in-distribution accuracy but exhibit systematic failures when generalizing to various factors such as program length and trace steps, though some architectural designs significantly improve generalization.

Conclusion: While Transformers can perform well on program trace generation in-distribution, they struggle with systematic generalization, highlighting the need for architectural improvements to handle out-of-distribution factors.

Abstract: We study Transformers on the task \emph{program trace generation} (PTG),
where models produce step-by-step execution traces for synthetic programs.
Unlike existing algorithmic problems, PTG externalizes reasoning through long
traces where each step is trivial. We train small Transformers with diverse
modifications, including alternative position encodings, softmax replacements,
hybrid model, and short convolutions. While these models achieve strong

Conclusion: DataMind successfully builds high-performing open-source data-analytic agents through systematic data synthesis and training methods, providing valuable insights for agentic training and releasing resources to the community.

Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific
discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however,
rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source
models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and
long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This
paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe
designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key
challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient
data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn
rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a
recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and
difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling
strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically
adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a
memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on
DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning
diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic
tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with
an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming
the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B
also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also
incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the
analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic
training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B
for the community's future research.

TL;DR: Proposes efficient lexical simplification framework using small LLMs for privacy-sensitive environments, addressing safety concerns through output probability-based filtering of harmful simplifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of large language models in real-world lexical simplification applications, particularly for privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments, while ensuring safety for vulnerable user groups like people with disabilities.

Method: Utilizes small LLMs deployable locally, explores knowledge distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines, and proposes filtering strategy using model's output probability to detect harmful simplifications.

Result: Knowledge distillation boosts automatic metric scores but introduces safety trade-off by increasing harmful simplifications. Model's output probability is effective for detecting harmful simplifications. Filtering strategy suppresses harmful simplifications while preserving beneficial ones.

Conclusion: Establishes benchmark for efficient and safe lexical simplification with small LLMs, highlighting trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates promising approach for safe real-world deployment.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face
challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS),
particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.
Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one
of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety
and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we
propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs
deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge
distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our
experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and
manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts
automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing
harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output
probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications.
Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful
simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes
a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key
trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a
promising approach for safe real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies language and retrieval bias in multilingual LLMs for fact-checking, revealing performance disparities across languages and skewed retrieval favoring popular claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual LLMs show language bias, performing better on high-resource languages like English than low-resource languages, and retrieval systems exhibit bias by favoring certain information.

Method: Evaluated six open-source multilingual LLMs across 20 languages using multilingual prompting with AMC-16K dataset, and analyzed retrieval bias using multilingual embedding models and claim frequency analysis.

Result: Found persistent bias in LLM behavior with performance disparities between monolingual and cross-lingual settings, and identified retrieval systems disproportionately favoring popular claims while under-representing less common ones.

Conclusion: The study highlights persistent biases in multilingual fact-checking systems and provides recommendations for improving equity in cross-lingual fact-checking applications.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for
cross-lingual fact-checking. However, these models often exhibit language bias,
performing disproportionately better on high-resource languages such as English
than on low-resource counterparts. We also present and inspect a novel concept
- retrieval bias, when information retrieval systems tend to favor certain
information over others, leaving the retrieval process skewed. In this paper,
we study language and retrieval bias in the context of Previously Fact-Checked
Claim Detection (PFCD). We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs across 20
languages using a fully multilingual prompting strategy, leveraging the AMC-16K
dataset. By translating task prompts into each language, we uncover disparities
in monolingual and cross-lingual performance and identify key trends based on
model family, size, and prompting strategy. Our findings highlight persistent
bias in LLM behavior and offer recommendations for improving equity in
multilingual fact-checking. To investigate retrieval bias, we employed
multilingual embedding models and look into the frequency of retrieved claims.
Our analysis reveals that certain claims are retrieved disproportionately
across different posts, leading to inflated retrieval performance for popular
claims while under-representing less common ones.

TL;DR: PbT is a teacher-student pipeline that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel data by using a teacher LLM to compress unpaired examples into intermediate representations, then training a student to reconstruct inputs from these IRs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge in low-resource NLG scenarios where practitioners often have only raw inputs or outputs but not both, forcing small models to learn from few examples or rely on costly synthetic data from large LLMs.

Method: Two-stage teacher-student pipeline: teacher LLM compresses unpaired examples into concise intermediate representations (IRs), then student model is trained to reconstruct inputs from IRs, enabling outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs.

Result: An 8B student trained only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70B teacher-generated corpora and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of direct synthesis.

Conclusion: PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with target style, highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the mismatch limiting direct synthesis, as confirmed by human evaluation.

Abstract: We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline
that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel
data. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,
practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,
or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom
both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely
on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses
this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise
intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs
from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,
yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five
benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization
(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired
setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained
only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora
and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated
pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of
direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only
PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style,
highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the
mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel NVFP4-based training method that enables stable 4-bit precision training of large language models, achieving comparable performance to FP8 baselines while significantly improving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training frontier LLMs requires massive computational resources (tens to hundreds of yottaflops). While FP8 training is widely adopted, transitioning to 4-bit precision (FP4) could unlock additional improvements in computational speed and resource utilization, but poses challenges to training stability and convergence.

Method: The approach integrates Random Hadamard transforms to bound block-level outliers, uses two-dimensional quantization for consistent forward/backward pass representations, employs stochastic rounding for unbiased gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers.

Result: The method was validated by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion tokens - the longest publicly documented 4-bit training run. The NVFP4-trained model achieved training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to an FP8 baseline.

Conclusion: NVFP4, when combined with the proposed training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM training algorithms, enabling efficient 4-bit training without sacrificing model quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many
domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size,
training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and
experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires
on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment
of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore
essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit
floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even
narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional
improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However,
quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence,
and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token
horizons.
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training
of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates
Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a
two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both
the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased
gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We
validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion
tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to
date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining
technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to
an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our
training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM
training algorithms.

However, existing steering frameworks suffer from critical limitations:
computational inefficiency, limited extensibility, and restricted functionality
that hinder both research progress and practical deployment. We present
EasySteer, a unified framework for high-performance, extensible LLM steering
built on vLLM. Our system features modular architecture with pluggable
interfaces for both analysis-based and learning-based methods, fine-grained
parameter control, pre-computed steering vectors for eight application domains,
and an interactive demonstration system. Through deep integration with vLLM's
optimized inference engine, EasySteer achieves 5.5-11.4$\times$ speedup over
existing frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
overthinking mitigation, hallucination reduction, and other key applications.
EasySteer transforms steering from research technique to production-ready
capability, establishing critical infrastructure for deployable, controllable
language models.

TL;DR: NAIPv2 is a debiased and efficient framework for estimating scientific paper quality that uses pairwise learning within domain-year groups and introduces Review Tendency Signal (RTS) to address scale inconsistencies in reviewer ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods for paper quality estimation have high inference costs, while direct score regression suffers from scale inconsistencies in reviewer ratings.

Method: Uses pairwise learning within domain-year groups to reduce rating inconsistencies, introduces Review Tendency Signal (RTS) as probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and confidences, and constructs NAIDv2 dataset with 24,276 ICLR submissions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman) with linear-time efficiency at inference. Demonstrates strong generalization on unseen NeurIPS submissions with scores increasing consistently from Rejected to Oral categories.

Conclusion: NAIPv2 establishes a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper quality estimation, marking progress toward future scientific intelligence systems.

Abstract: The ability to estimate the quality of scientific papers is central to how
both humans and AI systems will advance scientific knowledge in the future.
However, existing LLM-based estimation methods suffer from high inference cost,
whereas the faster direct score regression approach is limited by scale
inconsistencies. We present NAIPv2, a debiased and efficient framework for
paper quality estimation. NAIPv2 employs pairwise learning within domain-year
groups to reduce inconsistencies in reviewer ratings and introduces the Review
Tendency Signal (RTS) as a probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and
confidences. To support training and evaluation, we further construct NAIDv2, a
large-scale dataset of 24,276 ICLR submissions enriched with metadata and
detailed structured content. Trained on pairwise comparisons but enabling
efficient pointwise prediction at deployment, NAIPv2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance (78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman), while maintaining scalable,
linear-time efficiency at inference. Notably, on unseen NeurIPS submissions, it
further demonstrates strong generalization, with predicted scores increasing
consistently across decision categories from Rejected to Oral. These findings
establish NAIPv2 as a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper
quality estimation, marking a step toward future scientific intelligence
systems. Code and dataset are released at

### [192] [Incentive-Aligned Multi-Source LLM Summaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25184)
*Yanchen Jiang,Zhe Feng,Aranyak Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Truthful Text Summarization (TTS) is a framework that improves factual accuracy in LLM-based text synthesis by decomposing claims, eliciting source stances, scoring sources with peer-prediction, and filtering unreliable sources before re-summarizing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based search and answer systems have weak incentives for source accuracy and are vulnerable to adversarial content, leading to factual inaccuracies in synthesized responses.

Method: TTS framework with four steps: (1) decomposes draft synthesis into atomic claims, (2) elicits each source's stance on every claim, (3) scores sources using multi-task peer-prediction mechanism that rewards informative agreement, (4) filters unreliable sources before re-summarizing.

Result: Experiments show TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness while preserving fluency, aligns exposure with informative corroboration, and disincentivizes manipulation.

Conclusion: TTS establishes formal guarantees that align source incentives with informative honesty, making truthful reporting the utility-maximizing strategy for improved factual robustness without ground-truth labels.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in modern search and
answer systems to synthesize multiple, sometimes conflicting, texts into a
single response, yet current pipelines offer weak incentives for sources to be
accurate and are vulnerable to adversarial content. We introduce Truthful Text
Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework that improves factual
robustness without ground-truth labels. TTS (i) decomposes a draft synthesis
into atomic claims, (ii) elicits each source's stance on every claim, (iii)
scores sources with an adapted multi-task peer-prediction mechanism that
rewards informative agreement, and (iv) filters unreliable sources before
re-summarizing. We establish formal guarantees that align a source's incentives
with informative honesty, making truthful reporting the utility-maximizing
strategy. Experiments show that TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness
while preserving fluency, aligning exposure with informative corroboration and
disincentivizing manipulation.

### [193] [Learning to Parallel: Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models via Adaptive Parallel Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25188)
*Wenrui Bao,Zhiben Chen,Dan Xu,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Learn2PD is a framework that trains a lightweight filter model to enable adaptive parallel decoding in diffusion-based LLMs, achieving up to 22.58× speedup without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parallel decoding strategies in diffusion-based LLMs use fixed heuristics that don't adapt to input characteristics, leading to suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across different NLP tasks.

Method: Proposes Learn2PD framework with a lightweight filter model that predicts whether current token predictions match final output, and introduces End-of-Text Prediction (EoTP) to detect decoding completion. The filter is learned through post-training with minimal GPU time.

Result: Achieves up to 22.58× speedup without performance drop on LLaDA benchmark, and up to 57.51× speedup when combined with KV-Cache.

Conclusion: Learn2PD provides a flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding that significantly improves inference throughput while maintaining quality, outperforming fixed heuristic methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ sequential steps for $n$ tokens, fundamentally limiting
inference throughput. Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token
generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding
strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence
thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting
in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work,
we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We
propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a
lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position,
whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter
approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when
correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a
post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize
it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction
(EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant
decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves up to 22.58$\times$ speedup without any performance drop,
and up to 57.51$\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.

Abstract: Building Large Language Model agents that expand their capabilities by
interacting with external tools represents a new frontier in AI research and
applications. In this paper, we introduce InfoAgent, a deep research agent
powered by an innovative data synthesis pipeline and orchestrated web search
tools. To construct challenging, hard-to-find queries,we build entity trees and
apply sub-tree sampling with entity fuzzification to systematically increase
question difficulty. Unlike prior work that relies heavily on commercial search
tools, we develop a dedicated self-hosted search infrastructure, enhancing
transparency of agent environments and facilitating further advancement of
agent capacity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our data pipeline by measuring
the average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and
also show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our
tools. Our \mbox{InfoAgent} is post-trained from Qwen3-14B using a two-stage
recipe: cold-start supervised finetuning to instill long-horizon search
behaviors, followed by reinforcement learning which significantly improves
reasoning-driven tool use. With our methods, InfoAgent achieves 15.3\% accuracy
on BrowseComp, 29.2\% on BrowseComp-ZH, and 40.4\% on Xbench-DS, outperforming
prior open-source deep research agents such as WebSailor-72B and DeepDive-32B.

Motivation: To improve identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge from LLMs and VLMs, addressing the limitation of overly simplified human queries.

Method: Query-to-Event decomposition using knowledge embedded in LLMs and VLMs, adaptable across datasets and models, with entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion of multimodal knowledge (visual and speech-based inputs).

Result: Q2E outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on two diverse datasets across multiple retrieval metrics, and shows that integrating audio information significantly improves text-to-video retrieval.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances query understanding through knowledge decomposition and multimodal fusion, demonstrating strong performance in zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

TL;DR: MATS is a behavioral audit that measures VLMs' ability to reject visually contradicted statements, revealing systematic failures in instruction-tuned generative models while contrastive encoders show better robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks hide systematic failures in VLMs that reduce real-world trust, so there's a need for behavioral audits to measure truthfulness in multimodal contexts.

Method: Introduces MATS audit with two metrics (SCS and IAR), uses activation patching to causally localize failure loci in different VLM architectures.

Result: Instruction-tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) show very low spatial consistency and high incorrect agreement, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are more robust.

Conclusion: Activation patching identifies specific failure locations in different model architectures and suggests concrete repair paths for improving VLM reliability.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel algorithm for joint scale and rotation estimation in image alignment with sub-pixel precision using Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates and cross-correlation maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phase-correlation techniques work well for translational shifts but fail to handle scale and rotation changes that occur from camera zooming or rotational movements, which are common in real-world scenarios.

Method: Integrates scale and rotation estimation using Fourier transform in log-polar coordinates with cross-correlation maximization strategy, leveraging the auxiliary function method and incorporating sub-pixel-level cross-correlation.

Result: Experimental results show lower mean estimation errors for both scale and rotation compared to conventional Fourier transform-based techniques that use discrete cross-correlation.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides precise joint estimation of scale and rotation with sub-pixel accuracy, outperforming existing Fourier-based approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

Method: Proposes Topology Graph Consistency (TGC) framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between prediction graphs and references.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GlaS and CRAG datasets under 5-10% supervision and significantly narrows the gap to full supervision.

Conclusion: TGC effectively enforces global topology in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, making it particularly valuable for computational pathology applications with limited annotations.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational

TL;DR: This survey paper reviews both supervised and unsupervised person re-identification methods, highlighting that supervised approaches have limited room for improvement while unsupervised methods are rapidly advancing and narrowing the performance gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised person Re-ID requires extensive labeled data which poses scalability challenges, while unsupervised methods can leverage abundant unlabeled data. Recent developments show promising progress in unsupervised approaches.

Method: The survey categorizes significant publications in supervised person Re-ID and explores the latest advancements in unsupervised person Re-ID over the past three years, providing insights into emerging trends.

Result: Supervised person Re-ID has reached a mature state with little room for further improvement, while unsupervised techniques are showing promising developments and narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods.

Conclusion: The survey captures both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes in unsupervised learning, contributing to the evolving narrative of person re-identification research.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Mambas (ViMs) face quadratic token scaling issues. The paper introduces Sequential Token Merging (STM) to address Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) and hidden state protection, achieving significant token reduction with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViMs achieve success with sub-quadratic complexity but are constrained by quadratic token scaling with image resolution. Existing methods overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) and Mamba's selective scan for gradual information aggregation.

Method: Proposed Sequential Token Merging (STM) with: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden states protection to stabilize hidden states around the class token. Leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal forgetfulness into stability.

Result: STM achieves: 1.0% accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for ViM-S at 40% reduction. Achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with minimal complexity.

Conclusion: STM provides superior token reduction with minimal accuracy degradation, offering new insights into state-space model dynamics and achieving state-of-the-art efficiency for Vision Mambas.

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model

### [203] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CLIP-style contrastive learning framework that efficiently aligns hyperspectral image voxel embeddings with text representations using minimal parameter updates (0.07% of total), achieving state-of-the-art performance on hyperspectral scene understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images present unique challenges due to their high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, and existing vision-language models are not optimized for this domain. There's a need for efficient cross-modal alignment in hyperspectral scene understanding.

Method: Uses CLIP-style contrastive training to map voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone to a frozen large embedding model's latent space. Employs hard and semi-hard negative sampling with descriptive prompts as structured anchors for alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.07% parameter updates: +0.92 OA and +1.60 Kappa on Indian Pines, +0.69 OA and +0.90 Kappa on Pavia University, using 50-90× fewer parameters than baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates that efficient hyperspectral scene understanding can be achieved through targeted cross-modal alignment with minimal parameter updates, outperforming existing methods while being significantly more parameter-efficient.

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

### [204] [Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking for One-Shot Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22700)
*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPR-NIAM is a one-shot federated prompt learning method that uses attention masking to restrict interaction between text and prompt embeddings, enabling better cross-task generalization with minimal communication rounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FPL methods require multi-round communication and lack cross-task generalization, while one-shot FL methods focus only on seen tasks without generalization capability.

Method: Uses attention isolation module to suppress prompt-to-text attention and reweight text-to-prompt attention, plus cross-silo collaborative refinement to integrate decentralized visual knowledge and align multi-source cross-modal knowledge.

Result: Outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods on ten benchmark datasets in both class-level and domain-level generalization under two tasks.

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM effectively enables one-shot federated prompt learning with strong cross-task generalization through non-interfering attention masking and collaborative refinement.

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement

TL;DR: GZSL-MoE integrates Mixture-of-Experts into Generative Zero-Shot Learning for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, improving performance on both seen and unseen classes in HRC environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of 3D point cloud semantic segmentation when comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable, particularly in Human-Robot Collaboration environments.

Method: Integrates Mixture-of-Experts layers into Generator and Discriminator components of GZSL model to generate realistic fake features that resemble real features extracted using pre-trained KPConv model on seen classes.

Result: The GZSL-MoE model demonstrates enhanced performance on both seen and unseen classes in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: GZSL-MoE provides a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments when complete training data is unavailable, showing improved generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing inductive biases through learned masks allows Vision Transformers to learn effectively on small datasets without Knowledge Distillation, resulting in more accurate models while maintaining explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers lack the inductive biases of CNNs, which limits their performance on small datasets. Current solutions require large datasets or Knowledge Distillation to learn these biases.

Method: Developed IBiT (Inductively Biased Image Transformers) that introduce inductive biases through learned masks, enabling effective learning on small datasets.

Result: IBiT models are significantly more accurate on small datasets compared to standard Vision Transformers, while retaining the explainability benefits of Transformers.

Conclusion: Learned masks can effectively introduce CNN-like inductive biases into Vision Transformers, enabling strong performance on small datasets without requiring Knowledge Distillation.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

*Zezhong Fan,Xiaohan Li,Luyi Ma,Kai Zhao,Liang Peng,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kaushiki Nag,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutAgent is an agentic framework that combines vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion to generate realistic multi-object scene layouts that respect semantic relations and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models lack explicit spatial reasoning for realistic object layouts, while traditional spatial planning methods in robotics struggle with semantic richness in visual scenes. This gap needs to be bridged.

Method: The framework uses visual-language models for preprocessing (segmentation, object size estimation, scene graph construction, prompt rewriting), then compositional diffusion to synthesize bounding boxes respecting object relations, and finally a foreground-conditioned image generator to compose the complete scene.

Result: LayoutAgent outperforms state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic framework successfully unifies vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for generating realistic multi-object scene layouts that maintain both semantic richness and spatial plausibility.

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompareBench is a new benchmark for evaluating visual comparison reasoning in VLMs, revealing systematic limitations in temporal ordering, spatial relations, basic counting, and geometric comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual comparison reasoning is a fundamental but understudied skill in vision-language models that needs systematic evaluation.

Method: Created CompareBench with 1000 QA pairs across four tasks (quantity, temporal, geometric, spatial) derived from auxiliary datasets TallyBench and HistCaps, and evaluated both closed-source and open-source VLMs.

Result: Clear scaling trends observed but models consistently fail at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and make mistakes in basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans.

Conclusion: Visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for current VLMs, and CompareBench provides foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILR is a test-time reasoning method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent space using policy gradient optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning-based image generation methods are limited to single modality reasoning or require high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning, which restricts their effectiveness and applicability.

Method: MILR performs joint reasoning over image and text in a unified latent vector space by searching through discrete token representations using policy gradient method guided by an image quality critic, operating entirely at test time within the MUG framework.

Result: MILR achieves state-of-the-art results on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE benchmarks, with an 80% improvement over baseline on knowledge-intensive WISE (overall score 0.63), and demonstrates strong temporal and cultural reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Joint reasoning in a unified latent space is key to MILR's strong performance, enabling effective cross-modal reasoning without fine-tuning while demonstrating non-trivial temporal and cultural reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

TL;DR: UESA-Net is a U-shaped network with multidirectional shrinkage attention that improves breast and thyroid ultrasound lesion segmentation by bridging global context with local details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in ultrasound imaging including speckle noise, overlapping structures, and weak global-local feature interactions that existing networks struggle with.

Method: Encoder-decoder architecture with attention modules operating along horizontal, vertical, and depth directions, using shrinkage strategies to integrate prior knowledge with local features.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with IoU scores of 0.8487 on TN3K dataset (3493 images) and 0.6495 on BUSI dataset (780 images).

Conclusion: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in ultrasound segmentation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods rely heavily on semantic labels and global image representations, often missing crucial part-level cues needed to distinguish closely related categories.

Method: Introduces PartCo (Part-Level Correspondence Prior), a framework that leverages part-level visual feature correspondences to capture finer-grained semantic structures and better understand category relationships.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show PartCo significantly improves performance of current GCD approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: PartCo bridges the gap between semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, setting new benchmarks for Generalized Category Discovery.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new
benchmarks for GCD. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/partco

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT is an efficient fine-tuning framework for Text-to-Image models that decomposes weight matrix updates into two trainable low-rank components, achieving state-of-the-art performance across personalization, object adaptation, and visual in-context learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing alignment with target distributions, learning novel concepts from limited data, retaining instruction ability for multiple tasks, and maintaining editability while minimizing computational resources in fine-tuning T2I models.

Method: Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning (DEFT) adapts pre-trained weight matrices by decomposing updates into: (1) projection onto the complement of a low-rank subspace defined by one trainable matrix, and (2) a low-rank update using another trainable matrix for flexible parameter adaptation.

Result: State-of-the-art performance demonstrated on Dreambooth, Dreambench Plus (personalization), InsDet (object/scene adaptation), and VisualCloze (visual in-context learning) datasets with both Stable Diffusion and unified models.

Conclusion: DEFT effectively addresses efficient fine-tuning challenges, highlighting emergent properties of the approach while maintaining computational efficiency and achieving superior performance across diverse T2I tasks.

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

Motivation: Existing video evaluators provide limited single scores without interpretability, failing to capture the comprehensive multi-faceted nature of video quality assessment needed for text-to-video generation.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on VideoFeedback2 dataset (27,168 human-annotated videos) followed by reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance analytical robustness.

Result: Achieves 44.35 accuracy (+5.94 improvement) on VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 average performance (+4.32 improvement) across four out-of-domain benchmarks, while providing interpretable assessments.

Conclusion: VideoScore2 bridges the gap between evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for Best-of-N sampling, offering superior multi-dimensional video assessment with interpretable rationales.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSMs like VMamba show degraded generalization performance under distribution shifts, despite being efficient alternatives to Vision Transformers.

Method: Leverages diverse traversal permutations to generate multiple causal perspectives, uses model predictions as pseudo-labels to update Mamba-specific parameters, and averages adapted weights across traversal scans.

Result: Experiments on seven benchmarks show TRUST consistently improves robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

Conclusion: TRUST is the first approach that explicitly leverages SSMs' unique architectural properties for adaptation, effectively addressing distribution shift issues.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves

Motivation: Visual personalization is crucial for user-facing AI systems like smart homes and healthcare, but current VLMs remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to individual users.

Method: MMPB includes 10k image-query pairs across 111 personalizable concepts in four categories, with three task types and a three-stage evaluation protocol (concept injection, multi-turn dialogue, personalized querying) using 23 VLMs.

Result: Most VLMs struggle with personalization, particularly in maintaining dialogue consistency, handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Challenges include refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting.

Conclusion: MMPB identifies significant limitations in VLM personalization and provides a scalable benchmark for future research toward truly personalized multi-modal AI.

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing adversarial patch attacks that rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world applicability.

Method: Combines generative U-Net design with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement for semantic-aware localization that maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism.

Result: Achieves attack success rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99% across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16). Outperforms prior white-box attacks, untargeted baselines, and non-realistic approaches.

Conclusion: Establishes a new benchmark for adversarial robustness research by simultaneously ensuring realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability - the three most challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks, bridging the gap between theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

TL;DR: CrossScaleNet is a novel architecture that combines patch-based cross-attention with multi-scale processing for time series forecasting, providing both high performance and enhanced temporal explainability without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are computationally expensive and complex, while existing explainable models often fail to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. There's a need for models that offer transparent decision-making in time series forecasting.

Method: Uses patch-based cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing, embedding attention mechanisms directly into the training process to provide intrinsic explainability for temporal saliency.

Result: Outperforms most transformer-based models on real-world forecasting tasks, demonstrates superior performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy, and maintains strong performance across datasets of varying complexity.

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet successfully bridges the gap between explainability and performance in time series forecasting, offering a balanced approach that effectively captures temporal saliency while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting results.

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

Method: Transfer learning methodology using multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA pre-trained on GTV datasets and fine-tuned on private IGTV cohort (LUCID dataset), with a novel slice interaction module (SIM) in 2.5D segmentation framework to model inter-slice relationships using channel and spatial attention branches.

Result: Achieved Dice score of 0.609 on private IGTV dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of transfer learning combined with multimodal techniques and SIM to enhance reliability and clinical relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras have bio-inspired advantages but obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data is challenging and expensive, creating a need for synthetic event data generation.

Method: Uses diffusion-based generative model with control signals (text labels, 2D skeletons, 3D poses) and leverages diffusion prior from foundation models like Stable Diffusion for minimal fine-tuning with limited labeled data.

Result: Successfully synthesizes event data for visual recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation, enhancing model performance in all tasks. Can generate events from unseen text labels.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces event data labeling costs and demonstrates powerful text-based generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their
bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic
range. However, obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based
vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present
ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize
high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text
labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the
diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model
performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based
on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based
generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

### [220] [Learning KAN-based Implicit Neural Representations for Deformable Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22874)
*Nikita Drozdov,Marat Zinovev,Dmitry Sorokin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR are novel deformable image registration methods that integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with implicit neural representations, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with reduced computational costs through randomized basis sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based DIR methods require large datasets and struggle with precision, while implicit neural representations suffer from computational inefficiency and seed-dependent instability. KANs offer a promising alternative but need optimization for medical image registration tasks.

Method: Proposed KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR that integrate KANs into DIR with INRs, using a randomized basis sampling strategy to reduce basis functions while maintaining quality, significantly lowering computational costs.

Result: Achieved highest accuracy among INR-based methods across lung CT, brain MRI, and cardiac MRI datasets, with minimal computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random seeds. RandKAN-IDIR slightly outperformed KAN-IDIR while eliminating additional training complexity.

Conclusion: KAN-based approaches provide an effective solution for deformable image registration, combining the accuracy of classical methods with the efficiency of learning-based approaches, with randomized basis sampling offering performance improvements without added complexity.

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

### [221] [Convolutional Set Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22889)
*Federico Chinello,Giacomo Boracchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Convolutional Set Transformer (CST) is a neural architecture that processes image sets of arbitrary size, handling 3D image tensors directly for simultaneous feature extraction and contextual modeling, outperforming existing methods in set classification and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing set-input networks like Deep Sets and Set Transformer are limited to vector inputs and require cascading with CNN feature extractors, preventing direct processing of 3D image tensors and missing synergies between feature extraction and contextual modeling.

Method: CST operates directly on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling simultaneously through a novel architecture that combines convolutional operations with set processing capabilities.

Result: CST achieves superior performance in Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection tasks, provides native compatibility with CNN explainability methods like Grad-CAM, and can be pre-trained on large datasets and adapted to new domains via Transfer Learning.

Conclusion: CST represents a significant advancement in set-input neural networks by enabling direct 3D image tensor processing, offering better performance, explainability, and transfer learning capabilities compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and
surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal
features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections
from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,
we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a

pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance
regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20
different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5

*Yuelin Xin,Yuheng Liu,Xiaohui Xie,Xinke Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a continuous submanifold field embedding representation for 3D Gaussian Splatting to address parameter heterogeneity and non-uniqueness issues in neural network learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS's parameter-based representation is hard to learn as features due to non-unique and heterogeneous nature, causing data-dependent models when directly used in neural networks.

Method: Develops embedding representation based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives.

Result: The approach preserves color and geometric structure while enforcing unique mapping and channel homogeneity for better learning.

Conclusion: The proposed embedding representation benefits learning of 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks by providing a more principled approach.

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Soft-Di[M]O introduces soft embeddings to make one-step generators from Masked Diffusion Models fully differentiable, enabling post-distillation refinements like adversarial training and reward fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-step generators distilled from MDMs have limitations: they inherit modeling bias from teachers and their discrete token outputs block gradient flow, preventing post-distillation refinements.

Method: Proposes soft embeddings that replace discrete tokens with expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution, creating a differentiable continuous surrogate compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image performance, one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN refinement, higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

Conclusion: Soft embeddings enable end-to-end trainable one-step generators and straightforward application of various refinement techniques, significantly improving performance across multiple MDM teachers.

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

*Chenghan Yang,Peng Zhou,Dong-Sheng Zhang,Yueyun Wang,Hong-Bin Shen,Xiaoyong Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishAI 2.0 is an intelligent marine fish recognition framework that integrates multimodal few-shot deep learning with image generation for data augmentation, achieving high accuracy for rare species with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges with incomplete datasets and poor model accuracy, especially for rare species with few-shot conditions where data scarcity significantly hampers performance.

Method: Uses hierarchical marine fish dataset, employs DeepSeek LLM to generate textual descriptions, uses Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation via hierarchical diffusion strategy, and trains CLIP-based model for few-shot image recognition.

Result: Achieves Top-1 accuracy of 91.67% and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97% at family level, outperforming baseline models. At genus and species levels, achieves 87.58% and 85.42% Top-1 accuracy respectively.

Conclusion: FishAI 2.0 improves marine fish identification efficiency and accuracy, providing a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and conservation with practical applicability.

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

TL;DR: Proposes an automatic deep-learning framework for brain tumor detection from MRI scans using ResNet50 with Dense-Dropout sequence and introduces a new balanced dataset (MMCBT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely detection of brain tumors is critical for patient outcomes, and there's a lack of reliable brain tumor MRI resources for research.

Method: Uses pre-trained ResNet50 for feature extraction, Global Average Pooling, linear projection, and a novel Dense-Dropout sequence to enhance feature learning and reduce overfitting.

Result: Created the MMCBT dataset with 209 subjects (3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images) and developed a framework that addresses class imbalance through augmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and new dataset provide an effective solution for automatic brain tumor detection with improved robustness and reduced overfitting.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

TL;DR: Hemorica is a publicly available dataset of 372 head CT scans with comprehensive annotations for five intracranial hemorrhage subtypes, enabling robust AI development for ICH diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented public data hindering AI development for intracranial hemorrhage diagnosis on CT scans by providing a unified, high-quality annotated dataset.

Method: Created Hemorica dataset with 372 head CT exams (2012-2024) annotated for five ICH subtypes using double-reading workflow with neurosurgeon adjudication. Fine-tuned standard CNN and transformer models for binary classification and segmentation tasks.

Result: Lightweight models achieved 87.8% F1 score for binary classification and 85.5% Dice score for lesion segmentation, validating dataset quality and sufficient sample size.

Conclusion: Hemorica provides a unified benchmark supporting multi-task learning, transfer learning, and facilitates AI assistant development for ICH detection and quantification systems.

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

*Wenbin Teng,Gonglin Chen,Haiwei Chen,Yajie Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARSS is an autoregressive framework that uses a GPT-style model to generate novel views from a single image, outperforming diffusion models in view synthesis tasks by maintaining temporal consistency through camera trajectory conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have limitations in world modeling tasks like novel view generation due to non-causal generation causing distortions and inconsistencies across views, while autoregressive models offer causal generation that can better adapt knowledge incrementally.

Method: Uses a GPT-style decoder-only AR model with video tokenizer to map image sequences to discrete tokens, camera encoder for 3D positional guidance, and an autoregressive transformer module that permutes spatial order while maintaining temporal order.

Result: Extensive experiments show ARSS performs comparably to or better than state-of-the-art diffusion-based view synthesis approaches on public datasets.

Conclusion: ARSS demonstrates that autoregressive models can effectively handle novel view generation tasks while maintaining temporal consistency, offering a viable alternative to diffusion models for world modeling applications.

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

TL;DR: Proposes a method to reduce static bias in action recognition by separating temporal dynamic information from static scene information using statistical independence loss and scene prediction loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action recognition models excessively rely on static cues rather than dynamic human motion, leading to poor performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition.

Method: Uses statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams combined with a scene prediction loss to separate temporal dynamic information from static scene information.

Result: The method effectively reduces static bias and experiments confirm the importance of scene prediction loss.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully mitigates static bias in action recognition models by explicitly separating dynamic motion information from static scene cues.

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

### [230] [Desensitizing for Improving Corruption Robustness in Point Cloud Classification through Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23010)
*Zhiqiang Tian,Weigang Li,Chunhua Deng,Junwei Hu,Yongqiang Wang,Wenping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Desensitized Adversarial Training (DesenAT) to address DNNs' over-reliance on point cloud features, which makes them vulnerable to corrupted data. The method uses feature desensitization and self-distillation to improve model robustness against point cloud corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud corruption is inevitable due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision. DNNs' over-reliance on input features makes them vulnerable, but it's unclear if this issue exists in 3D tasks and whether reducing feature dependence can enhance robustness to corrupted point clouds.

Method: Proposes Desensitized Adversarial Training (DesenAT): 1) Quantifies DNN sensitivity to point cloud features using Shapley values, 2) Generates adversarial samples by eliminating high-contribution components and using spatial transformation to simulate corruption, 3) Uses self-distillation to transfer knowledge from clean samples to adversarial samples within a distillation framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C show that DesenAT effectively improves model robustness against corrupted point clouds without reducing performance on clean datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DesenAT method successfully addresses DNNs' over-reliance on point cloud features by smoothing sensitivity through adversarial training and self-distillation, significantly enhancing model robustness to corrupted point clouds while maintaining clean data performance.

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

*Zetian Wu,Tianshuo Zhou,Stefan Lee,Liang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel sign language translation method that incorporates anatomical constraints and geometric relationships between skeletal joints to generate more natural and biomechanically plausible body movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating accurate and natural body poses in sign language translation, as prior methods often produce rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs by neglecting anatomical constraints and coordination patterns.

Method: Explicitly models relationships among skeletal joints (shoulders, arms, hands) with geometric constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. Uses parent-relative reweighting for finger flexibility, bone-pose losses, and bone-length constraints to enforce anatomical consistency.

Result: Reduces performance gap between previous best and ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, decreases bone length discrepancies by 18.76%, and reduces movement variance discrepancies by 5.48%.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves significant improvements in anatomical realism and motion naturalness for sign language translation from text to video.

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

### [232] [Planning with Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23014)
*Yihao Sun,Zhilong Zhang,Yang Yu,Pierre-Luc Bacon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-Plan is a planning framework using unified multimodal models (UMMs) that enables visual reasoning for decision-making, outperforming VLM-based methods on long-horizon tasks without needing expert demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM/VLM-based decision-making approaches rely solely on language reasoning, limiting their ability to make informed decisions. UMMs that support multimodal inputs/outputs offer greater potential by enabling reasoning through generated visual content.

Method: Built on UMMs where a single model serves as policy, dynamics model, and value function. Introduces self-discriminated filtering to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions - the generative model acts as self-discriminator to filter invalid predictions.

Result: Substantially improves success rates on long-horizon planning tasks compared to VLM-based methods. Shows strong data scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better performance with same training data size.

Conclusion: This work lays foundation for future research in reasoning and decision-making with unified multimodal models, demonstrating their superior potential over language-only approaches.

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

*Xiafeng Man,Zhipeng Wei,Jingjing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-Plus-Minus (DPM) is a novel framework that detects copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models by measuring output deviations when including/excluding training data, using differential privacy principles and fine-tuning simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address legal and ethical concerns about large vision models memorizing copyrighted content, and overcome limitations of existing detection approaches that lack robustness and theoretical foundations.

Method: Formalize copyright infringement detection using Differential Privacy concepts, introduce conditional sensitivity metric, simulate inclusion/exclusion via fine-tuning in learning/unlearning directions, and compute confidence scores over orthogonal prompt distributions.

Result: DPM reliably detects infringement content without needing original training data or text prompts, providing interpretable and practical intellectual property protection.

Conclusion: DPM offers a theoretically grounded, robust solution for copyright infringement detection in generative AI models, with standardized benchmarking through the CIDD dataset.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

*Gabriel A. Viana,Luis F. Alves Pereira,Tsang Ing Ren,George D. C. Cavalcanti,Jan Sijbers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a principled framework to optimize perceptual loss design for LDCT denoising, showing that better loss configurations significantly improve noise reduction and structural fidelity without changing network architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perceptual losses are promising for LDCT enhancement but involve underexplored design choices like feature representation level, pretraining dataset, and loss weighting, which current literature configurations often underperform on.

Method: Proposed perceptual influence metric to quantify perceptual loss contribution, and conducted systematic experimentation to assess impact of loss design choices on training performance.

Result: Better perceptual loss designs lead to significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of reconstructed CT images compared to widely used configurations.

Conclusion: Provides objective guidelines for effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising, supported by statistical analysis, with source code made publicly available.

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

### [235] [Sensor-Adaptive Flood Mapping with Pre-trained Multi-Modal Transformers across SAR and Multispectral Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23035)
*Tomohiro Tanaka,Narumasa Tsutsumida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight multi-modal transformer model for flood detection that works with SAR-only, MS-only, or combined sensor data, achieving high performance with only 0.4M parameters while outperforming larger baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address operational challenges in flood mapping: single-sensor approaches face weather dependency and limited revisit periods, while multi-sensor fusion requires heavy computation and large datasets.

Method: Fine-tuned Presto, a lightweight multi-modal pre-trained transformer (0.4M parameters) that processes both SAR and multispectral data at pixel level, enabling flexible input combinations through single model architecture.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in optimal sensor-fusion scenario, outperforming Prithvi-100M baseline. Maintained strong performance in MS-only (F1: 0.893) and functional in SAR-only (F1: 0.718) scenarios.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach provides accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability constraints.

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

### [236] [GeLoc3r: Enhancing Relative Camera Pose Regression with Geometric Consistency Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23038)
*Jingxing Li,Yongjae Lee,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeLoc3r enhances pose regression methods through Geometric Consistency Regularization, achieving both fast inference speed and high accuracy by teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the speed-accuracy dilemma in camera pose estimation, where regression methods like ReLoc3R are fast but have geometric inconsistencies, while correspondence-based methods like MASt3R are accurate but slow.

Method: Uses Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR) during training: generates dense 3D-2D correspondences using ground-truth depth, weights them with a FusionTransformer, computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC, and transfers this geometric knowledge into the regression network through a consistency loss.

Result: Significantly outperforms ReLoc3R on benchmarks: 40.45% vs 34.85% AUC@5° on CO3Dv2 (16% improvement), 68.66% vs 66.70% on RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs 49.60% on MegaDepth1500, while maintaining fast inference speed.

Conclusion: GeLoc3r represents a paradigm shift by teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, achieving both the speed of regression methods and the geometric understanding of correspondence methods.

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

*Ye-eun Kim,Suhyeon Lim,Andrew J. Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning system for recognizing upper limb activities of daily living in stroke patients, addressing the gap in existing HAR research that primarily focuses on non-disabled individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a shortage of rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients despite increasing demand. Remote monitoring systems can reduce medical staff burden, but current HAR technologies are unsuitable for stroke patients as they focus on non-disabled individuals and simple actions using machine learning rather than deep learning.

Method: The system uses IMU sensors and RGB-D camera to collect multimodal data. The researchers directly collected a dataset, investigated appropriate preprocessing, and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data from stroke patients.

Result: Analysis showed that stroke patient action data is less clustered than non-disabled individuals' data. The proposed model learned similar tendencies for each label in data with features that are difficult to cluster, demonstrating effectiveness for stroke patient action recognition.

Conclusion: The study suggests the potential to expand deep learning models trained on stroke patient action features beyond simple recognition to include assessment feedback for domiciliary rehabilitation. The code is publicly available.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

### [238] [Activation Matching for Explanation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23051)
*Pirzada Suhail,Aditya Anand,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An activation-matching approach generates minimal binary masks that preserve both model predictions and intermediate activations, providing faithful explanations for classifier decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create minimal, faithful explanations for pretrained classifier decisions that preserve both the model's prediction and internal activations while being human-interpretable.

Method: Train a lightweight autoencoder to output binary masks using multi-layer activation matching (KL divergence + cross-entropy), mask priors (L1 area, binarization penalty, total variation), and abductive constraints for faithfulness.

Result: Produces small, crisp binary masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding irrelevant regions, yielding practical minimalist explanations.

Conclusion: The approach successfully generates minimal yet faithful explanations that preserve model decision-making while being interpretable through compact binary masks.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

*Ruilang Wang,Shuotong Xu,Bowen Liu,Runlin Huang,Donglong Chen,Weifeng Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask What Matters is a text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis that uses vision-language models to apply differentiated masking on diagnostically relevant regions, achieving better performance with lower masking ratios than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the scarcity of annotated medical imaging data and inefficiency of random high-ratio masking in existing self-supervised approaches, which leads to poor semantic alignment and limited adaptability across tasks and modalities.

Method: Leverages vision-language models for prompt-based region localization to apply differentiated masking that emphasizes diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas, enabling controllable text-guided masking.

Result: Outperforms existing MIM methods across multiple medical imaging modalities (brain MRI, chest CT, lung X-ray) with gains of up to +3.1% in classification accuracy, +1.3 in BoxAP, and +1.1 in MaskAP for detection, while using substantially lower masking ratios (40% vs 70%).

Conclusion: Controllable text-driven masking enables semantically aligned self-supervised learning and advances the development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMC-DETR is a novel framework for aerial-view object detection that uses frequency-decoupled fusion to address challenges in detecting tiny objects, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial imagery is challenging due to limited visual cues and difficulty in modeling global context. Existing methods suffer from delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear modeling, creating performance bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes FMC-DETR with three key components: 1) WeKat backbone using cascaded wavelet transforms for global low-frequency context perception and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for adaptive non-linear modeling; 2) Cross-stage Partial Fusion module for reduced redundancy and improved multi-scale feature interaction; 3) Multi-Domain Feature Coordination module unifying spatial, frequency, and structural priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark aerial-view datasets. On VisDrone dataset, shows improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over baseline with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: FMC-DETR effectively addresses tiny object detection challenges in aerial imagery through frequency-decoupled fusion, demonstrating superior performance in balancing detail preservation and global enhancement.

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper revisits fundamental problems in image inpainting preference alignment using direct preference optimization with public reward models, finding that most reward models provide valid scores for preference data construction, preference data shows robust scaling trends, reward models have observable biases, and simple ensemble methods yield robust results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate fundamental problems in achieving preference alignment for image inpainting rather than introducing new methods, and to establish a simple yet solid baseline for this promising research direction.

Method: Leveraged direct preference optimization for alignment training, employed public reward models to construct preference training datasets, conducted experiments across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models with varying structures and generative algorithms.

Result: Alignment models significantly outperformed prior models across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations without changing model structures or using new datasets. Simple ensemble of reward models yielded robust and generalizable results by mitigating biases.

Conclusion: The work establishes a simple yet solid baseline for image inpainting preference alignment, demonstrating that preference alignment can be effectively achieved using existing methods and datasets, and hopes to push this promising research frontier forward.

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAG is a lightweight foundation model for computational pathology that uses cross-magnification distillation to transfer knowledge from 20x to 5x magnification, achieving comparable accuracy to larger models with 30x faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models in computational pathology are computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to massive parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements.

Method: Cross-magnification distillation framework that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to efficient 5x magnification student architecture, using dual-level knowledge transfer (global image representations and local spatial token mapping).

Result: XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration (8.8 WSIs per minute), requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Cross-magnification distillation is a viable approach for deploying foundation model capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

*Na Min An,Inha Kang,Minhyun Lee,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch is a zero-shot referring image segmentation framework that enhances spatial representations in both text and image modalities without additional training, improving performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models like CLIP struggle with spatial relationships - they focus on primary noun phrases in text and generate similar features for images with different spatial layouts, limiting spatial grounding capabilities.

Method: CoPatch constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context tokens with spatial cues, extracts patch-level image features from intermediate layers where spatial structure is better preserved, and fuses these into a clustered image-text similarity map (CoMap) for mask selection.

Result: Significantly improves spatial grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut benchmarks (+2-7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the importance of recovering and leveraging untapped spatial knowledge inherently embedded in VLMs, opening opportunities for zero-shot referring image segmentation.

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore

*Emadeldeen Hamdan,Ahmet Enis Cetin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTMA-Net combines Hadamard Transform with multiplication-avoiding in-memory computing to reduce multiplication costs in DNNs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing multiplication costs is critical for efficient deep neural network deployment in energy-constrained edge devices.

Method: Selectively replaces intermediate convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers using multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.

Result: Eliminates up to 52% of multiplications compared to baseline ResNet models while achieving comparable accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet.

Conclusion: Combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards efficient deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task instruction dataset for remote sensing change understanding, and proposes ChangeVG, a vision-guided vision-language model with dual-granularity awareness that outperforms existing methods on change captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks for remote sensing change understanding, which is essential for analyzing how human activities affect the environment.

Method: The authors construct ChangeIMTI dataset and design ChangeVG model with dual-branch vision-guided module that combines fine-grained spatial feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization, using these representations as auxiliary prompts to guide large vision-language models during instruction tuning.

Result: The method outperforms the strongest baseline Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric for change captioning task, and extensive experiments across four tasks demonstrate the superiority of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed ChangeVG model with vision-guided module and dual-granularity awareness effectively facilitates hierarchical cross-modal learning for remote sensing change understanding tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

*Chenrui Ma,Xi Xiao,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yanning Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified multistage generative framework using Conditional Dependent Coupling that decomposes generation into interpolant trajectories, enabling end-to-end optimization and knowledge sharing while achieving high fidelity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing image generation models: VAE-based models suffer from information loss and limited detail, pixel-space models have prohibitive computational costs, and cascade models prevent effective end-to-end optimization and knowledge sharing.

Method: Proposes Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy that decomposes generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, modeled as a single unified Diffusion Transformer to enable end-to-end optimization and knowledge sharing.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions, overcoming the computation-fidelity trade-off in existing approaches.

Conclusion: The unified multistage framework successfully addresses key challenges in image generation by enabling accurate distribution learning, end-to-end optimization, and knowledge sharing while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

Motivation: Current MLLMs lack capability for complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and domain-specific tools in Earth observation, while existing agent-based methods are limited to RGB perception and shallow reasoning without systematic evaluation.

Method: Earth-Agent framework unifies RGB and spectral EO data within MCP-based tool ecosystem, supporting dynamic invocation of expert tools and models across modalities for geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal analysis.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show effectiveness across different LLM backbones, outperforming general agent frameworks and MLLMs on remote sensing benchmarks, with evaluation on 248 expert-curated tasks using 13,729 images.

Conclusion: Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, advancing the field toward scientifically grounded, next-generation LLM applications in Earth observation with publicly released code and dataset.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth
observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on task-specific physical priors, limiting scalability and generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains underexplored.

Method: Uses lumina-chroma decomposition to decouple degradation from content, LDGM module for learning luminance degradation priors via frequency-domain amplitude modulation, and DACR module for contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches across multiple weather datasets with strong generalization to complex weather degradations.

Conclusion: WeatherCycle provides an effective unified framework for multi-weather image restoration that doesn't require complex weather modeling and demonstrates superior performance in unsupervised settings.

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense facilitates bandwidth-efficient human-centric media transmission for applications like real-time motion analysis, virtual human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate vehicle axle counting is essential for traffic control, toll collection, and infrastructure development, but previous methods have limitations in dense environments with occlusions and long vehicles.

Method: Combines YOLO-OBB for vehicle detection/categorization and YOLO for tire detection, with intelligent tire-vehicle association and novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to handle occlusions and partial detections.

Result: Significantly reduces false positives and improves axle-counting accuracy for long vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos.

Conclusion: Represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting systems that can replace legacy roadside infrastructure.

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting

### [253] [Confidence-Calibrating Regularization for Robust Brain MRI Segmentation Under Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23176)
*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM is a lightweight adaptation framework that improves SAM's performance on medical volumes by reducing domain shift sensitivity and penalizing overconfident predictions through feature Fisher information and confidence misalignment penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM shows strong zero-shot performance on natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to medical volumes like brain MRI, requiring adaptation for reliable medical image segmentation.

Method: CalSAM uses two key components: (1) Feature Fisher Information Penalty (FIP) on 3D feature maps to reduce encoder sensitivity to domain shift, and (2) Confidence Misalignment Penalty (CMP) to penalize overconfident voxel-wise errors. Only the mask decoder is fine-tuned while keeping SAM's encoders frozen.

Result: On BraTS scanner split (Siemens→GE): +7.4% DSC improvement (80.1% vs 74.6%), -26.9% HD95 reduction (4.6mm vs 6.3mm), -39.5% ECE reduction (5.2% vs 8.6%). On ATLAS-C (motion corruptions): +5.3% DSC improvement (75.9%), -32.6% ECE reduction (5.8%).

Conclusion: CalSAM effectively improves domain generalization and uncertainty calibration for brain MRI segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency by freezing SAM's encoder, with FIP and CMP providing complementary performance gains.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

TL;DR: A new unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation framework that uses synthetic point cloud generation, flexible temporal sampling, and dynamic-weighting loss to outperform existing methods like UNIT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised 3D instance segmentation methods suffer from limited training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy pseudo-labels, which limits their performance and robustness.

Method: Proposes synthetic point cloud sequence generation for training diversity, flexible temporal sampling using both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, and dynamic-weighting loss to emphasize confident samples.

Result: Outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet datasets, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods through synthetic data generation, flexible temporal modeling, and adaptive loss weighting, demonstrating superior performance in unsupervised 3D instance segmentation.

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

TL;DR: GaP (Gaussian Patch) is a black-box adversarial attack method that creates a universal, physically transferable patch for face recognition systems using a query-efficient greedy algorithm with Gaussian blobs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most adversarial attacks on face recognition systems are limited to digital domains or require white-box access, creating a need for practical black-box attacks that can work in physical settings.

Method: Uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale forehead patch by adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model.

Result: With ~10,000 queries to a black-box ArcFace model, GaP achieves high attack success rates in both digital and real-world physical tests, and shows strong transferability to unseen FaceNet models.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a practical and severe vulnerability in face recognition systems, proving that robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the target system.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

*Seongsoo Heo,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRI is a novel model inversion method that progressively detaches important patches while allowing others to continue evolving, achieving faster inversion than existing methods while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard model inversion is computationally expensive for Vision Transformers, and existing sparse methods like SMI discard patches prematurely, suppressing both class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge transfer.

Method: Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI) incrementally detaches the most important patches during inversion to create sparse synthetic images, while letting remaining patches continue evolving for future selection, enabling the 'Re-Birth effect' where less informative patches gradually accumulate class-relevant knowledge.

Result: PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than Dense Model Inversion and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching DMI performance.

Conclusion: PRI effectively balances efficiency and knowledge transfer by allowing patches to evolve progressively, demonstrating that discarding patches prematurely is inefficient for model inversion.

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework that uses model self-consistency between long responses and short binary answers to automatically generate preference pairs for training, reducing hallucinations without human annotations or external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise reliability. Existing methods require extensive human annotations or external supervision from more powerful models.

Method: Leverages model's self-consistency between long responses and short binary answers to generate preference pairs. Uses short binary questions (which yield reliable responses) to query the target model and rank its generated responses. Implements self-reflection pipeline where detailed responses are compared against concise binary answers.

Result: Significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability on multiple benchmarks (AMBER, MultiObject-Hal, Object HalBench, MMHal-Bench). Maintains robust instruction-following ability with enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled data by relying solely on self-consistency rather than external supervision.

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TATTOO is a training-free aesthetic-aware outfit recommendation system that uses multimodal LLMs to generate item descriptions and aesthetic profiles, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fashion outfit-completion methods require expensive task-specific training on large labeled data and lack explicit human aesthetics guidance. The rise of MLLMs enables a training-free paradigm with better aesthetic awareness.

Method: Uses MLLMs to generate target-item descriptions and aesthetic chain-of-thought to distill images into structured aesthetic profiles (color, style, occasion, season, material, balance). Fuses visual outfit summaries with textual descriptions and aesthetics vectors using dynamic entropy-gated mechanism for ranking in shared embedding space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Aesthetic-100 dataset compared to training-based methods. Also demonstrates advanced zero-shot retrieval capability on Polyvore dataset.

Conclusion: TATTOO successfully streamlines fashion outfit recommendation to a training-free paradigm using MLLMs, providing better recommendation scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness without expensive labeled data requirements.

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal imaging improves ADAS safety in low-light and harsh weather, but faces dataset limitations and poor simulator representation. Existing RGB-to-thermal methods only support one-to-one mappings.

Method: Multi-modal translation framework using Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN) that adapts styles to different image components individually rather than globally.

Result: Produces more realistic and diverse thermal image translations compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: CoAdaIN enables effective one-to-many RGB-to-thermal mapping for ADAS applications, addressing dataset limitations and improving thermal image generation quality.

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a privacy-preserving alternative to camera-based activity recognition that is robust to illumination changes, using LiDAR point clouds.

Method: Map LiDAR frames to proximity graphs (epsilon-graphs), compute Laplacian spectrum, use eigenvalues and eigenvector statistics as pose descriptors, and apply temporal statistics over sliding windows for classification with SVM and random forests.

Result: Achieved 94.4% accuracy on 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all 27 activities in MM-Fi dataset under strict subject-independent protocol, outperforming skeleton-based baselines.

Conclusion: The method provides a compact, interpretable feature set derived directly from point cloud geometry that offers an accurate and efficient alternative to end-to-end deep learning for human activity recognition.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

*Atakan Topaloglu,Kunyi Li,Michael Niemeyer,Nassir Navab,A. Murat Tekalp,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleGS is a novel framework that combines generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse-view novel view synthesis using Gaussian Splatting, employing a "propose-and-validate" approach with 3D-aware diffusion models and multi-view stereo validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view novel view synthesis suffers from severe geometric ambiguity, creating a trade-off where regressive models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, while generative models can complete scenes but introduce structural inconsistencies.

Method: Uses a "propose-and-validate" framework: first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views for complete scene proposal, then repurposes a multi-view stereo model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate 3D uncertainties using attention maps, guiding Gaussian Splatting optimization via uncertainty-weighted loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic by filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions.

Conclusion: OracleGS successfully reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity by conditioning powerful generative priors on multi-view geometric evidence, providing a robust solution for sparse-view novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is crucial for India's agriculture, water management, and climate risk planning, but remains challenging due to sparse ground observations and complex regional variability.

Method: Uses attention-guided U-Net architecture with seven geospatial modalities (land surface temperature, NDVI, soil moisture, relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, land use) at 1 km resolution, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall class imbalance.

Result: The multimodal framework consistently outperforms unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, particularly in extreme rainfall categories.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable framework, benchmark dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large (Multimodal) Language Models face limitations like hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance on extensive fine-tuning datasets for domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding in sensitive fields like medicine, finance, and material science.

Method: SynDoc employs a synthetic data generation workflow with structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation, adaptive instruction tuning for discriminative models, and a recursive inferencing mechanism that iteratively refines outputs from both models.

Result: The framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding, bridging the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Conclusion: SynDoc provides a novel solution that addresses key challenges in domain-specific VRDU by combining discriminative and generative approaches with synthetic data generation and iterative refinement mechanisms.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

TL;DR: Vid-Freeze is an adversarial attack that adds perturbations to images to disrupt motion synthesis in I2V models while preserving image semantics, effectively blocking malicious video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks of image-to-video generation models being used for deceptive or malicious content creation, as existing defenses are insufficient for blocking motion synthesis.

Method: An attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted perturbations to images, explicitly targeting the attention mechanism of I2V models.

Result: The immunized images generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious content creation while preserving semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: Attention attacks are a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against misuse of I2V generation models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

*Minsun Jeon,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using defocus blur as a physically interpretable forensic signal for deepfake detection, since synthetic images often lack realistic depth-of-field characteristics present in camera-captured images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled mass production of photorealistic synthetic images, threatening the integrity of visual media and making it difficult to distinguish authentic from fabricated content.

Method: Construct a defocus blur map as a discriminative feature for detecting manipulated content, leveraging that defocus blur is a depth-dependent optical phenomenon naturally occurring in camera-captured images but often missing in synthetic images.

Result: Experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images, supported by three in-depth feature analyses.

Conclusion: Defocus blur serves as an effective forensic signal for deepfake detection due to its universal optical imaging principles and physical scene structure encoding, making it robust and generalizable.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

TL;DR: Diff-SPK is the first diffusion-based method for reconstructing perceptible images from spike camera data in low-light high-speed scenarios, using enhanced texture conditioning and ControlNet to generate high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spike cameras produce asynchronous spike streams that need reconstruction for human perception, but existing methods struggle with severe noise and sparse information in low-light high-speed conditions.

Method: Uses Enhanced Texture from Inter-spike Interval (ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams, then employs ControlNet with ETFI conditioning and feature fusion modules to generate high-speed scenes.

Result: The method demonstrates superiority on real low-light spike streams and establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for low-light spike stream reconstruction with quantitative illumination information.

Conclusion: Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to handle challenging low-light high-speed spike camera scenarios, providing a robust solution for spike stream reconstruction.

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for multimodal remote sensing data analysis is popular but faces challenges with modality imbalance in DDPMs and effectively leveraging diffusion features for complementary feature extraction.

Method: Uses adaptive modality masking for balanced DDPM training, hierarchically guides feature extraction across CNN, Mamba, and transformer networks with fusion and attention mechanisms, and employs mutual learning for inter-branch collaboration.

Result: Extensive experiments on four multimodal remote sensing datasets show superior classification performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The BDGF framework effectively addresses modality imbalance in DDPMs and successfully leverages diffusion features to guide complementary feature extraction for improved land-cover classification.

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose that VLMs appear culturally competent but actually rely on symbolic shortcuts and lack genuine cultural understanding, posing risks in real-world applications.

Method: Developed a diagnostic framework using classification and explanation analysis to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural imagery across Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes.

Result: Models correctly identify prominent Western festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations, revealing systematic cultural biases.

Conclusion: Current VLMs use symbolic shortcuts rather than genuine cultural reasoning, highlighting the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C3-OWD is a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning framework that unifies robustness (via RGBT pretraining) and generalization (via vision-language alignment) for object detection, addressing the trade-off between these two challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world object detection faces limitations in generalization to unseen categories and robustness under adverse conditions. Prior work addressed these issues separately, creating a trade-off where achieving both robustness and diversity simultaneously remains difficult.

Method: Two-stage curriculum learning: Stage 1 enhances robustness through RGBT data pretraining, Stage 2 improves generalization via vision-language alignment. Uses Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism to prevent catastrophic forgetting between stages.

Result: Achieves 80.1 AP50 on FLIR, 48.6 AP50_Novel on OV-COCO, and 35.7 mAP_r on OV-LVIS, demonstrating competitive performance across both robustness and diversity evaluations.

Conclusion: C3-OWD effectively unifies robustness and generalization capabilities in object detection through a carefully designed curriculum learning approach with theoretical guarantees against catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for pansharpening have high computational complexity, limiting their use on resource-limited devices. Binary neural networks (BNNs) offer efficiency but cause spectral distortion and spatial feature degradation when applied to pansharpening.

Method: Designed S2B-Conv modules with Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) using dynamic affine transformations and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA) with random frequency/angle selection to handle multi-scale anisotropic features. Multiple S2B-Conv modules form the S2BNet architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments show the binarized pansharpening method achieves promising performance with high efficiency, successfully addressing spectral distortion and spatial feature degradation issues.

Conclusion: S2BNet demonstrates that binary neural networks can be effectively applied to pansharpening tasks through customized convolution designs that preserve spectral-spatial properties while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

*Hongrui Jia,Chaoya Jiang,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free visual-reasoning pipeline that decouples reasoning and perception, using an LLM to orchestrate reasoning while a LMM serves as a visual question-answering engine to prevent visual grounding loss in extended reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic and lose visual grounding as reasoning chains extend, leading to reasoning paths that diverge from image content and produce erroneous conclusions.

Method: Decouple reasoning and perception processes: a powerful LLM orchestrates high-level reasoning and strategically interrogates a LMM to extract specific visual information needed for logical chains, while the LMM functions exclusively as a visual question-answering engine.

Result: Significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and substantial improvement in reasoning fidelity, validated through comprehensive evaluations.

Conclusion: The lightweight, plug-and-play approach effectively governs visual reasoning process without requiring additional training or architectural changes.

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP) is a replay-free framework for multi-label class-incremental learning that addresses semantic confusion and partial labeling issues through class-specific prompts and progressive confidence decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based methods work well for single-label incremental learning but perform poorly in multi-label scenarios due to semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and true-negative-false-positive confusion from partial labeling.

Method: DDP uses class-specific positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and Progressive Confidence Decoupling (PCD) to suppress false positives. It freezes past prompts as knowledge anchors and employs interlayer prompting for efficiency.

Result: On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10 benchmark.

Conclusion: DDP effectively addresses the key challenges in multi-label class-incremental learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring replay mechanisms.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10
benchmark.

*Bin Wu,Yahui Liu,Chi Zhang,Yao Zhao,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRPO is the first online RL framework for Blind Face Restoration that uses likelihood regularization to improve restoration quality while balancing perceptual quality and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind Face Restoration faces challenges with large solution space causing artifacts like missing details and identity ambiguity in restored images.

Method: Proposes Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) with three key strategies: composite reward function, ground-truth guided likelihood regularization, and noise-level advantage assignment.

Result: LRPO significantly improves face restoration quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed LRPO framework effectively addresses BFR challenges and demonstrates superior restoration performance through online reinforcement learning with proper regularization.

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: DentVLM establishes as a robust clinical decision support tool that can enhance primary dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to specialized medical expertise in dentistry.

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary
dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to
specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

TL;DR: Dynamic-TreeRPO enhances text-to-image generation with tree-structured sampling and LayerTuning-RL, improving exploration efficiency and quality while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based flow matching models for text-to-image generation suffer from exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling due to slight variations in sampling groups.

Method: Proposes Dynamic-TreeRPO with sliding-window sampling as tree-structured search using dynamic noise intensities, GRPO-guided optimization, constrained SDE sampling, and LayerTuning-RL that integrates SFT with RL via dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by 4.9% on HPS-v2.1, 5.91% on PickScore, and 8.66% on ImageReward benchmarks, while improving training efficiency by nearly 50%.

Conclusion: The tree-structured sampling and LayerTuning-RL paradigm enable dynamic exploration of diverse search spaces, achieving superior semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment.

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

### [277] [Test-time Uncertainty Estimation for Medical Image Registration via Transformation Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23355)
*Lin Tian,Xiaoling Hu,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A test-time uncertainty estimation framework for image registration that works with any pretrained network by analyzing prediction variance under spatial perturbations, decomposing uncertainty into intrinsic spread and bias jitter components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep registration networks lack reliability indicators, and existing uncertainty methods require architectural changes or retraining, limiting their use with pretrained networks.

Method: Leverages transformation equivariance property by applying spatial perturbations to inputs and analyzing variance of network predictions, providing theoretical decomposition of uncertainty into intrinsic spread (epistemic noise) and bias jitter (systematic error drift).

Result: Across four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, lung) and multiple registration models, uncertainty maps consistently correlate with registration errors and identify regions requiring caution.

Conclusion: The framework enables any pretrained registration network to become risk-aware at test time, advancing safe deployment in clinical and research settings.

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAPE is a plug-and-play enhancement that uses ranking-aware policy optimization to improve CLIP-based retrieval under distribution shifts (multilingual, long-form, multimodal) by incorporating ranking signals into LLM-based query rewriting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with distribution shifts in retrieval tasks (multilingual, long-form, multimodal queries) and existing LLM-based query rewriting methods lack supervision signals to generate optimal queries aligned with the retriever's training distribution.

Method: GRAPE uses Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization (GRPO) to incorporate ranking signals into retrieval-guided query rewriting with LLMs. It addresses score inflation through corpus-relative ranking-based rewards that align optimization with ranking metrics.

Result: GRAPE achieves average improvement of 4.9% in Recall@10 across various distribution shifts including multilingual (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600), length (Wikipedia), and multimodal (CIRR) differences.

Conclusion: GRAPE effectively bridges distributional gaps in CLIP-based retrieval systems by incorporating ranking signals into query rewriting, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across diverse distribution shifts.

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasPoinTr is a point cloud completion framework using cascaded networks and knowledge distillation to reconstruct missing regions from incomplete point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world point clouds are often incomplete due to sensor limitations, occlusions, and noise, making completion essential for applications. The key challenge is predicting overall shape and reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete inputs.

Method: Two-stage cascaded framework: Shape Reconstruction generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion uses this with knowledge distillation. A teacher model trained on denser point clouds transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings, demonstrating superior shape recovery and detail preservation.

Conclusion: The cascaded structure and knowledge distillation strategy effectively bridge the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets by capturing global shape context while refining local details.

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPose is a unified cross-modality method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation that transfers 2D pose annotations to 3D domain using RGB-D sequences without requiring 3D keypoint annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations and bridge the gap between 2D and 3D pose estimation without multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data shift issues.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning on RGB-D sequences, transfers 2D HPE annotations from RGB datasets to 3D domain via point cloud networks with spatial-temporal constraints (body symmetry, joint motion), 2D-to-3D back-projection loss, and cross-modality interaction. Implements anchor-to-joint prediction for 3D lifting on RGB and depth networks.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets. Performance improves with large-scale unlabeled data (NTU RGB+D 60) under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: UniPose demonstrates strong potential for practical applications by enabling weakly supervised 3D pose estimation and achieves state-of-the-art results with the proposed 3D lifting method.

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Goliath-SC, the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape registration, and proposes a generative model for self-contact poses conditioned on body shape parameters using body-part-wise latent diffusion with self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-contact datasets lack variety in poses and precise body shapes, limiting analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. Body shape significantly affects self-contact (e.g., hand-belly contact differs for low vs high BMI individuals).

Method: Created Goliath-SC dataset with 383K self-contact poses across 130 subjects. Proposed generative modeling of self-contact prior using body-part-wise latent diffusion with self-attention, conditioned on body shape parameters. Incorporated this prior into single-view human pose estimation with contact refinement.

Result: Shape conditioning proved vital for successfully modeling self-contact pose distribution. The approach improved single-view pose estimation in self-contact scenarios.

Conclusion: Body shape conditioning is essential for accurate self-contact modeling, and the proposed method effectively enhances single-view pose estimation by incorporating shape-aware self-contact priors.

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

TL;DR: WorldSplat is a feed-forward framework for 4D driving-scene generation that produces consistent multi-track videos with high-quality novel-view synthesis capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing methods - driving-scene generation lacks 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage for novel-view synthesis, while 3D/4D reconstruction approaches lack generative capabilities.

Method: Two-step approach: (i) 4D-aware latent diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to generate pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians, (ii) refinement of novel view videos using enhanced video diffusion model.

Result: Extensive experiments show WorldSplat effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

Conclusion: WorldSplat successfully bridges the gap between scene generation and reconstruction, providing scalable and controllable training data for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fracture diagnosis relies on physician expertise, which limits speed and accuracy. Deep learning models like YOLO show potential but need further improvements for better fracture detection performance.

Method: Proposes Fracture-YOLO with two key modules: CRSelector that uses global texture information to focus on critical fracture features, and ScA that dynamically adjusts feature weights across different scales for multi-scale fracture identification.

Result: Fracture-YOLO achieves significant improvements over baseline with mAP50 increasing by 4 and mAP50-95 increasing by 3, surpassing baseline model and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The improved YOLO-based model with CRSelector and ScA modules effectively enhances fracture detection capabilities, demonstrating superior performance for medical imaging analysis.

Abstract: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis,
traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced
physicians, however the speed and accuracy of this approach are constrained by
the expertise. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, deep
learning models based on the YOLO framework have been widely employed for
fracture detection, demonstrating significant potential in improving diagnostic
efficiency and accuracy. This study proposes an improved YOLO-based model,
termed Fracture-YOLO, which integrates novel Critical-Region-Selector Attention
(CRSelector) and Scale-Aware (ScA) heads to further enhance detection
performance. Specifically, the CRSelector module utilizes global texture

*Yuyang Sun,Cuiming Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FracDetNet is an advanced fracture detection framework that integrates Dual-Focus Attention and Multi-scale Calibration to improve detection of subtle and diverse fractures in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate fracture detection is essential for clinical diagnostic efficiency, but existing methods struggle with detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging angles and suboptimal image quality.

Method: FracDetNet integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) to capture detailed local features and comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention mechanisms, and Multi-scale Calibration (MC) to adaptively refine feature representations.

Conclusion: FracDetNet demonstrates significant improvements in fracture detection accuracy through its innovative attention and calibration mechanisms, making it a valuable tool for clinical diagnostic applications.

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is
proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture
detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical
practice. Despite recent advancements, existing methods still struggle with
detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging
angles and suboptimal image quality. To overcome these limitations, FracDetNet
integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC).
Specifically, the DFA module effectively captures detailed local features and
comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention
mechanisms. Additionally, the MC adaptively refines feature representations to
enhance detection performance. Experimental evaluations on the publicly
available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
FracDetNet achieving a mAP$_{50-95}$ of 40.0\%, reflecting a \textbf{7.5\%}
improvement over the baseline model. Furthermore, the mAP$_{50}$ reaches
63.9\%, representing an increase of \textbf{4.2\%}, with fracture-specific
detection accuracy also enhanced by \textbf{2.9\%}.

*Sahithya Ravi,Aditya Chinchure,Raymond T. Ng,Leonid Sigal,Vered Shwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPIKE is an inference-time framework that identifies surprising moments in videos using Bayesian Surprise, enabling better frame sampling for Video-LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most Video-LLMs use uniform frame sampling, which often misses critical surprising moments that define a video's narrative.

Method: SPIKE quantifies Bayesian Surprise as belief updates from new visual evidence. SPIKE-RL uses GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on video caption rewards, enabling surprise-weighted frame sampling.

Result: Achieves strong correlation with human surprise judgments on benchmarks (FunQA, Oops!). Shows consistent performance gains on five downstream benchmarks over uniform sampling.

Conclusion: Enables Video-LLMs to track beliefs and register surprise, paving the way for more robust models that can revise understanding in response to new information.

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

*Mohammed Alsakabi,Wael Mobeirek,John M. Dolan,Ozan K. Tonguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FM-SIREN and FM-FINER address feature redundancy in periodic activation-based implicit neural representations by assigning neuron-specific frequency multipliers inspired by Nyquist sampling, improving signal reconstruction across 1D-3D tasks without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing periodic activation-based INR networks suffer from hidden feature redundancy due to fixed frequency multipliers, limiting MLP expressive capacity by having neurons capture overlapping frequency components.

Method: Propose FM-SIREN and FM-FINER with neuron-specific frequency multipliers informed by Nyquist sampling theory, introducing frequency diversity without hyperparameter tuning or additional network depth.

Result: Reduces feature redundancy by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal reconstruction across 1D audio, 2D image, 3D shape fitting, and NeRF synthesis, outperforming baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The simple yet principled modification of assigning Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency multipliers effectively reduces feature redundancy and enhances INR performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

*Tanawan Premsri,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoR-SALE is a framework that enhances text-to-image generation by incorporating Frame of Reference (FoR) concepts to better handle spatial descriptions from different perspectives, improving alignment between text and generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with spatial descriptions from perspectives other than the camera view, creating a performance gap in spatial reasoning tasks.

Method: Extends SLD framework by evaluating text-image alignment using FoR, extracts spatial configuration from images, maps spatial expressions to camera perspectives, and applies latent-space operations to adjust facing direction and depth.

Result: Improves state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% on spatial understanding benchmarks using only one correction round.

Conclusion: Integrating Frame of Reference into multimodal models significantly enhances their spatial reasoning capabilities in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

*Tharindu Ekanayake,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPCNet is a compact module that converts view-dependent 3D poses into body-centered canonical frames using hybrid graph-transformer architecture and self-supervised learning, enabling consistent motion analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons with view-dependent signals that complicate comparative analysis in health and sports applications.

Method: Uses hybrid encoder fusing graph convolutional networks (local skeletal features) with transformers (global context) via gated cross-attention. Predicts continuous 6D rotation mapped to SO(3) matrix for pose alignment. Trained self-supervised on MM-Fi dataset with synthetic rotations.

Result: Reduces mean rotation error from over 20° to 3.4° and Mean Per Joint Position Error from ~64mm to 47mm on MM-Fi benchmark. Qualitative evaluation on TotalCapture shows acceleration signals from video correspond well with ground-truth IMU data.

Conclusion: The method effectively removes viewpoint variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis, making 3D pose estimation more suitable for health and sports science applications.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

TL;DR: A fine-grained test-time optimization framework that improves compositional faithfulness in text-to-image generation by decomposing prompts into semantic concepts and using concept-level feedback for iterative prompt refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models often fail to faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation without retraining.

Method: Decomposes input prompts into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both global and concept levels using a fine-grained CLIP variant. The concept-level feedback on missing/inaccurate concepts is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop using a large language model.

Result: Experiments on DrawBench and CompBench prompts demonstrate significant improvements in concept coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time optimization and base T2I models.

Conclusion: The proposed fine-grained test-time optimization framework effectively enhances compositional faithfulness in text-to-image generation by providing detailed concept-level feedback for iterative prompt improvement.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFAS-DANet addresses domain adaptation challenges in multi-modal face anti-spoofing by handling missing modalities, noisy pseudo labels, and model degradation through complementary feature extraction, uncertainty-based pseudo labeling, and adaptive loss weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal FAS models fail to detect unseen attacks from new domains, and domain adaptation remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS despite being studied in single-modal approaches.

Method: Proposes three key techniques: 1) Complementary feature extraction to substitute/enhance missing modalities, 2) Uncertainty-based pseudo labeling using cross-modal predictions, 3) Adaptive loss weighting mechanism that adjusts based on adaptation stability.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in handling domain adaptation challenges for multi-modal FAS.

Conclusion: MFAS-DANet successfully addresses the three major challenges in multi-modal FAS domain adaptation and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image restoration methods face a critical trade-off where high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast models produce poor results. Existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features.

Method: Proposes RestoRect using rectified flow to reformulate feature distillation as a generative process. Combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints and trigonometric color space polarization. Introduces Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge transfer between different architectures through cross-normalized transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.

Result: Achieves better training stability, faster convergence and inference while preserving restoration quality. Demonstrates superior results across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

Conclusion: RestoRect successfully addresses the speed-quality trade-off in image restoration through its novel latent rectified flow feature distillation approach, enabling efficient yet high-quality restoration performance.

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how

'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS) is a novel framework for high-quality 4D reconstruction from monocular videos that uses scene orientation as stable structural guidance to model complex dynamic deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes rely on low-rank assumptions and struggle to model complex, region-specific deformations in unconstrained dynamic scenes.

Method: OriGS introduces a hyperdimensional representation based on scene orientation, including a Global Orientation Field for structural guidance and Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian that embeds time, space, geometry, and orientation into a unified probabilistic state for region-specific deformation modeling.

Result: Experiments show that OriGS achieves superior reconstruction fidelity over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: The orientation-anchored approach provides effective structural guidance for modeling complex dynamic deformations, enabling high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large-scale study reveals that multi-modal benchmarks often amplify image-only dependencies instead of promoting true multi-modal reasoning, with larger models masking this issue through intra-modality dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (individual modality contributions) and inter-modality dependencies (relationships between modalities) in multi-modal learning, as current benchmark evaluations poorly characterize these interactions.

Method: Conducted large-scale empirical study across 23 visual question-answering benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), covering domains like general/expert knowledge reasoning, OCR, and document understanding.

Result: Found significant variation in reliance on vision, text, and their interaction across benchmarks. Many benchmarks intended to reduce text-only biases actually amplified image-only dependencies. Larger models often use intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that masks lack of true multi-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: Provides quantitative characterization of multi-modal datasets, enabling principled approach to multi-modal benchmark design and evaluation by revealing how current benchmarks may not effectively measure true multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polyp segmentation is challenging due to diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast boundaries in medical imaging, requiring improved accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Integrates Dynamic Kernel mechanism initialized by global context from Encoder Attention module, with Unified Channel Adaptation in decoder for standardized feature dimensions and efficient information fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB datasets with superior Dice and IoU scores, while reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides a robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation with promising applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues like PLDs, which isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning. This makes PLDs ideal for testing action understanding constraints in multimodal large language models.

Method: Created ActPLD benchmark to evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source MLLMs on single-actor and socially interacting point-light displays.

Result: Models showed consistently low performance across all tested conditions, demonstrating significant gaps in their ability to understand action and spatiotemporal information from PLDs.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs lack the embodied experience and action understanding capabilities that humans naturally develop, as evidenced by their poor performance on PLD-based action recognition tasks.

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the role of chest CT in predicting disease progression and mortality in systemic sclerosis patients with interstitial lung disease, which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.

Method: Used a large-scale longitudinal chest CT analysis framework with radiomics and deep learning (ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer) on 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients, conducting mortality analyses at 1, 3, and 5 years.

Result: Models achieved AUCs of 0.769, 0.801, and 0.709 for predicting mortality within one, three, and five years respectively, with 181, 326, and 428 deaths in the dataset.

Conclusion: Both radiomics and deep learning methods show potential for improving early detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, representing a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early
detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking

TL;DR: An adaptive super-resolution framework for driver monitoring that improves model calibration and safety-critical performance while filtering hallucinations with a lightweight artifact detector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver monitoring systems need reliable confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. Direct low-resolution training yields high accuracy but poor calibration, which is dangerous in safety-critical scenarios.

Method: Resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events, with a lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters, 5.2ms overhead) to filter SR-induced hallucinations.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: best calibration (ECE 5.8% vs 6.2% baseline), highest AUPR for drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), superior precision-recall for phone use detection (0.74 vs 0.71).

Conclusion: While LR-trained models serve as strong general-purpose baselines, this adaptive framework represents the state-of-the-art for safety-critical applications where reliability is paramount.

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly
calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We
propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for
model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best
calibration (ECE of 5.8\% vs 6.2\% for LR-trained baselines), highest AUPR for
drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced
hallucinations. While LR-trained video models serve as strong general-purpose
baselines, our adaptive framework represents the state-of-the-art solution for
safety-critical applications where reliability is paramount.

### [298] [OVSeg3R: Learn Open-vocabulary Instance Segmentation from 2D via 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23541)
*Hongyang Li,Jinyuan Qu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVSeg3R is a training scheme for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that leverages 2D perception models and 3D reconstruction, achieving significant performance improvements on ScanNet200 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without costly manual annotation by leveraging existing 2D perception models and 3D reconstruction techniques.

Method: Projects 2D instance masks from open-vocabulary 2D models onto 3D scenes using reconstruction correspondences, uses View-wise Instance Partition to handle partial annotations, and employs 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint clustering to preserve object boundaries.

Result: +2.3 mAP overall improvement on ScanNet200 benchmark and +7.1 mAP improvement on novel classes under open-vocabulary setting compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: OVSeg3R effectively bridges 2D and 3D perception for open-vocabulary instance segmentation, significantly improving performance while reducing annotation costs.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey examines how 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is displacing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) across various domains including SLAM, telepresence, robotics, and 3D content generation due to its advantages in photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why 3DGS is increasingly replacing NeRF-based approaches and how it adapts to different domains with shared goals of photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream tasks.

Method: Systematic review and comparison of domain-specific pipelines, organized around unified research questions examining technical advantages, adaptation to input modalities, and remaining limitations.

Result: 3DGS balances photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency better than NeRF, making it suitable for perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual environments.

Conclusion: 3DGS offers a roadmap for leveraging neural rendering beyond image synthesis to include perception, interaction, and content creation, positioning it as a superior alternative to NeRF in many applications.

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First federated learning approach for pancreas part segmentation in MRI using privacy-preserving collaborative training across 7 institutions with 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic diseases show regional heterogeneity (cancers in head, chronic pancreatitis in tail), requiring accurate part segmentation for diagnosis and treatment planning, but challenged by MRI's variable morphology and poor soft-tissue contrast.

Method: Privacy-preserving FL framework with evaluation of 3 segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net, Swin UNETR) paired with 2 FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), plus novel anatomically-informed loss function for region-specific texture contrasts.

Result: Attention U-Net with FedAvg identified as optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, achieving clinically viable performance on distributed, heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses both technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in MRI and data scarcity through federated learning, enabling collaborative training without direct data sharing.

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroAdapter is a brain-to-image decoding framework that directly conditions latent diffusion models on brain signals, bypassing intermediate feature spaces and enabling better interpretability of how different brain areas influence image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current brain decoding methods use intermediate image/text features which mask the contributions of different brain areas. The goal is to create more transparent visual decoding that reveals how brain signals directly shape image generation.

Method: Proposes NeuroAdapter framework that directly conditions latent diffusion models on brain representations without intermediate features. Uses Image-Brain BI-directional interpretability (IBBI) to analyze cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps.

Result: Achieves competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals influence the generation process.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and establishes a path toward interpreting diffusion models through visual neuroscience, revealing how different cortical areas influence the generative trajectory.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

### [302] [RobuQ: Pushing DiTs to W1.58A2 via Robust Activation Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23582)
*Kaicheng Yang,Xun Zhang,Haotong Qin,Yucheng Lin,Kaisen Yang,Xianglong Yan,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobuQ is a systematic QAT framework that enables stable 2-bit activation quantization for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through RobustQuantizer and AMPN methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in sub-4-bit configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs show superior performance but face practical deployment challenges due to high computational and memory costs. Activation quantization is identified as the main bottleneck for low-bit quantization of DiTs.

Method: 1) Establish strong ternary weight baseline (W1.58A4), 2) Propose RobustQuantizer using Hadamard transform to normalize activation distributions, 3) Introduce AMPN - first Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline with ternary weights and layer-specific activation precisions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in sub-4-bit configurations. First to achieve stable and competitive image generation on ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits.

Conclusion: RobuQ framework successfully addresses activation quantization challenges in DiTs, enabling practical deployment of high-performance DiTs with significantly reduced computational and memory requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VividFace is a one-step diffusion framework for video face enhancement that addresses challenges in facial texture modeling, model generalization, and inference efficiency through flow matching, joint latent-pixel training, and automated data curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video face enhancement methods face three key challenges: difficulty in modeling intricate facial textures while maintaining temporal consistency, limited generalization due to lack of high-quality training data, and low efficiency from repeated denoising steps during inference.

Method: Built on pretrained WANX video generation model, VividFace uses single-step flow matching for efficient inference. It employs Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training with stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global reconstruction, and uses an MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated high-quality dataset selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while significantly reducing inference time compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: VividFace provides an efficient and effective solution for video face enhancement that overcomes key limitations of existing approaches, offering both superior performance and practical resources for the research community.

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

*Chenxi Zhao,Daochang Wang,Siqian Zhang,Gangyao Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer network that uses forward scattering center model data instead of simulated images to transfer purer target knowledge for SAR target recognition, addressing limitations of existing simulated data methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulated data methods for SAR target recognition contain irrelevant information like background and noise that affects knowledge transfer quality. The authors want to use forward scattering center model (FSCM) data which provides purer target knowledge with strong physical meaning and interpretability.

Method: Proposed Multi-level Heterogeneous Knowledge Transfer (MHKT) network that transfers FSCM knowledge at three levels: feature level (using task-associated information selector), distribution level (using maximum discrimination divergence metric), and category level (using category relation consistency constraint).

Result: Extensive experiments on two new datasets combining FSCM data and measured SAR images demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The stepwise knowledge selection and migration approach ensures integrity of migrated FSCM knowledge, providing an effective solution for SAR target recognition with limited samples by transferring purer target knowledge from simulated data.

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

Motivation: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have promising results but are limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization, constraining both restoration performance and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes VAMamba with two key components: 1) QCLAM (Queue-based Cache Low-rank Adaptive Memory) uses a FIFO cache to store historical representations and intelligently fuse features, 2) GPS-SS2D (Greedy Path Scan SS2D) uses Vision Transformer-generated score maps and greedy strategy to determine optimal adaptive scanning paths.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration.

Conclusion: VAMamba successfully overcomes the limitations of conventional Mamba architectures by enabling adaptive focus on degraded regions while maintaining high computational efficiency, setting new standards for adaptive image restoration.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current

A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while
maintaining high

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current deep hierarchical clustering methods that tie structure to class numbers and underutilize prototype information at intermediate hierarchical levels, inspired by human ability to organize knowledge hierarchically.

Method: Deep latent variable approach with complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior in variational inference framework, optimizing ELBO to discover taxonomic structures and prototype clusters without assuming true label sizes.

Result: Strong hierarchical clustering performance outperforming baselines across diverse image datasets, with novel evaluation leveraging prototype clusters at all hierarchical levels. Models discover rich interpretable taxonomies capturing coarse-grained semantic categories and fine-grained visual distinctions.

Conclusion: Deep taxonomic networks effectively bridge gaps in hierarchical clustering by automatically discovering meaningful taxonomic structures and prototype relationships from unlabeled data through variational inference with tree-structured priors.

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced generative models in medical imaging by bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical viability.

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding

TL;DR: VMDiff is a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes coherent objects by fusing two input images at noise and latent levels, addressing coexistent generation and semantic bias issues through hybrid sampling and adaptive parameter adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the fundamental problem of fusing visual cues from multiple sources in image generation, addressing challenges like coexistent generation (objects simply juxtaposed) and bias generation (one object dominating due to semantic imbalance).

Method: Proposes Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff) with: (1) hybrid sampling combining guided denoising, inversion, and spherical interpolation for structure-aware fusion; (2) adaptive adjustment module with similarity-based score to automatically search optimal parameters.

Result: Experiments on 780 concept pairs show VMDiff outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic consistency, and human-rated creativity.

Conclusion: VMDiff effectively addresses coexistent and bias generation problems in multi-source image fusion through its diffusion-based framework with hybrid sampling and adaptive parameter optimization.

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowLUT combines 3D LUT efficiency with flow matching to achieve real-time image enhancement with improved representational capacity and scene-adaptive color correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and representational capacity in deep learning-based image enhancement methods, where conventional 3D LUTs are fast but lack flexibility and depend on fixed priors.

Method: Integrates differentiable 3D LUTs with multiple priors, uses lightweight content-aware fusion prediction for scene-adaptive color correction with O(1) complexity, and employs iterative flow matching to restore local details and eliminate artifacts.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness on three benchmarks, achieving real-time processing with improved image quality.

Conclusion: FlowLUT successfully bridges the efficiency-representation gap in image enhancement by combining LUT speed with flow matching's detail restoration capabilities.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

TL;DR: A novel pipeline for text-controlled human-object interaction generation in 3D scenes with movable objects, addressing challenges of object identification, diverse interaction patterns, and collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-scene interaction datasets have limited interaction categories and only consider static objects. Collecting datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly, creating a need for better solutions.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Use 3D visual grounding to identify interaction objects, 2) Hand-object joint affordance learning for contact region prediction, 3) Optimization with local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show superiority in generating physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of movable human-object interaction generation, producing realistic interactions while avoiding collisions in 3D scenes.

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vessel segmentation approaches rely on supervised learning and extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography.

Method: BioVessel-Net integrates vessel biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation strategy, directly modeling vascular structures with biostatistical coherence without requiring labeled data or high-performance computing.

Result: BioVessel-Net achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised methods.

Conclusion: BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring, blood flow modeling, and progression prediction.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a
label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution

*Wei Pan,Huiguo He,Hiuyi Cheng,Yilin Shi,Lianwen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffInk is a latent diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation that outperforms existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-online handwriting generation methods focus on character- or word-level generation, leading to inefficiency and lack of holistic structural modeling for full text lines.

Method: Proposes DiffInk with two main components: InkVAE (sequential variational autoencoder with OCR-based and style-classification losses for latent space regularization) and InkDiT (latent diffusion Transformer that integrates text and style references).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while significantly improving generation efficiency.

Conclusion: DiffInk successfully addresses full-line handwriting generation with improved accuracy, style preservation, and efficiency through its dual-component architecture.

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

*YuQian Li,Limeng Qiao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIV introduces self-correction capability to Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models through Introspection Training and Recursive Inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MDVLMs lack self-correction ability and cannot correct errors in generated tokens, limiting their reliability and accuracy.

Method: Two novel mechanisms: 1) Introspection Training with an Introspection Model to detect grammatical, spelling, and logical errors; 2) Recursive Inference with alternating unmask→introspection→remask process until reliable results are obtained.

Result: Experimental results show RIV achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

Conclusion: RIV successfully equips MDVLMs with self-correction capability through recursive introspection, significantly improving model reliability and performance.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAMDA is a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework for multi-task dense prediction that uses Vision Foundation Models as teachers to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for target domains, enabling efficient student networks to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task dense prediction for robotics suffers from domain shift when deploying in new environments. Existing multi-task UDA methods rely on adversarial learning, which is less effective than recent self-training techniques.

Method: Integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into a self-training paradigm to generate pseudo-labels for the target domain, distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a single efficient student network.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on synthetic-to-real UDA multi-task learning benchmarks and a challenging day-to-night adaptation task. A lightweight variant is 10× smaller than foundation models while maintaining SOTA accuracy.

Conclusion: FAMDA enables training of highly efficient, domain-adaptive models suitable for resource-constrained robotics applications by leveraging VFMs as powerful teachers in a self-training framework.

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating
domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive solution for human motion tasks that leverages LLM capabilities while addressing challenges in motion representation, computational efficiency, and modality interference.

Method: Uses motion tokenizer with residual quantization, delay parallel modeling strategy for temporal staggering of token streams, and dual-tower architecture with modality-specific parameters.

Result: Superior performance across various motion-relevant tasks, with comprehensive ablation studies validating each component's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MotionVerse successfully integrates LLMs for motion tasks through innovative motion representation and modeling strategies, demonstrating strong capabilities in motion comprehension, generation, and editing.

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

### [316] [LightFair: Towards an Efficient Alternative for Fair T2I Diffusion via Debiasing Pre-trained Text Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23639)
*Boyu Han,Qianqian Xu,Shilong Bao,Zhiyong Yang,Kangli Zi,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightFair is a lightweight approach that improves fairness in text-to-image diffusion models by fine-tuning text embeddings with distance-constrained debiasing and two-stage sampling, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal training and sampling overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fair T2I methods suffer from heavy training/sampling burdens and poor performance. Since text encoder is the most fine-tunable front-end module, the paper aims to mitigate bias by addressing text embedding issues rather than full-model training.

Method: Proposes collaborative distance-constrained debiasing strategy to balance embedding distances, plus two-stage text-guided sampling to limit debiased encoder intervention while preserving generation quality.

Result: Achieves SOTA debiasing on Stable Diffusion v1.5 with only 1/4 training burden and virtually no sampling burden increase. Extensive experiments validate effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: LightFair provides an effective and efficient solution for fair T2I diffusion models by focusing on text encoder debiasing, demonstrating that targeted interventions can achieve fairness without compromising performance or efficiency.

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientMIL is a linear-complexity multiple instance learning approach for whole slide image classification that replaces quadratic-complexity self-attention with efficient sequence models (GRU, LSTM, Mamba) and includes an Adaptive Patch Selector for computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art MIL methods for whole slide image classification use attention mechanisms with quadratic complexity, requiring substantial computational resources when processing hundreds of thousands of patches.

Method: Proposed EfficientMIL with Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) module, replacing self-attention in Transformer-based MIL methods with linear-complexity sequence models including GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model Mamba.

Result: Achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933 on TCGA-Lung dataset with EfficientMIL-Mamba, and AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of 0.975 on CAMELYON16 dataset with EfficientMIL-GRU, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: EfficientMIL provides significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL methods across multiple histopathology datasets, with APS proving more effective for patch selection than conventional strategies.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Survey of topology-aware perception in autonomous driving, covering vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception, highlighting a shift from static to dynamic sensor-driven approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static maps are costly, hard to update in real-time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting scalability for autonomous driving systems.

Method: Systematic review of four core research directions: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception.

Result: Identified a unifying trend of paradigm shift from static pre-built maps to dynamic sensor-driven perception for real-time map construction and topology reasoning.

Conclusion: The reviewed approaches enable more adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving systems through compact spatial modeling, semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and multimodal scene understanding.

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method for multi-image layout control that uses reference images instead of text to specify content and provides explicit control over object placement in generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models have realistic generation capabilities but text-based control is limiting when precise placement guidance is needed. Defining both content and exact positioning is crucial for finer control.

Method: Training-free approach that uses single images per reference to specify content, providing explicit control for object and part-level composition without requiring model retraining.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness across various image composition tasks, enabling precise layout control with image-based references rather than text descriptions.

Conclusion: This approach provides simple yet powerful control over multi-image layouts, addressing the limitations of text-only guidance while maintaining training-free operation.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse-Up is a memory-efficient 3D texture modeling framework that preserves high-frequency details using sparse voxels, surface anchoring, and view-domain partitioning to overcome resolution constraints while maintaining multi-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D asset creation methods face a trade-off between cross-view consistency and fine texture detail, often losing high-frequency details due to resolution limitations of explicit voxels.

Method: Uses sparse voxels for texture reconstruction with surface anchoring (learnable upsampling to eliminate redundant voxels) and view-domain partitioning (image patch-guided voxel partitioning for gradient supervision on visible patches only).

Result: Reduces memory consumption during high-resolution voxel training by over 70% while preserving geometric consistency and high-frequency texture details.

Conclusion: Sparse-Up effectively breaks through resolution constraints in 3D texture modeling, enabling memory-efficient creation of high-fidelity 3D assets with preserved high-frequency details.

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of robust 6D pose estimation under challenging illumination conditions while maintaining efficiency for real-time tracking on edge devices, overcoming the trade-off between accuracy and speed.

Method: Uses a shared lighting-invariant color-pair feature representation for both initial estimation and tracking stages. For initial estimation: robust registration between live RGB-D view and object's 3D mesh. For tracking: same features validate temporal correspondences for lightweight motion regression.

Result: Extensive experiments show the integrated approach is effective and robust, providing competitive pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through abrupt pose changes.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully synergizes initial pose estimation with motion-based tracking using shared lighting-invariant features, achieving both accuracy and efficiency suitable for edge devices.

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

Motivation: Existing RLVR methods are underdeveloped for complex video reasoning due to data bottleneck - lack of challenging multi-hop questions and high-quality video-grounded Chain-of-Thought data.

Method: 1) Created ReWatch dataset with three components using multi-stage synthesis pipeline and Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis; 2) Developed ReWatch-R1 by post-training LVLM with SFT and RLVR framework featuring O&R reward mechanism.

Result: ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed ReWatch dataset and RLVR framework with O&R reward successfully advance video reasoning capabilities in LVLMs, addressing the critical data bottleneck and improving reasoning quality while reducing hallucination.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: HIVTP is a training-free method that improves Vision-Language Models efficiency through hierarchical visual token pruning using middle-layer attention maps to identify important tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from inefficient inference due to excessive visual tokens from vision encoders, with many tokens being unimportant and prunable.

Method: Uses attention maps from middle layers of vision encoder to estimate token importance, then applies hierarchical pruning: global stage retains important tokens per region, local stage keeps most important token per window.

Result: Reduces time-to-first-token by up to 55.1% and improves token generation throughput by up to 60.9% without accuracy loss, even achieving improvements on some benchmarks.

Conclusion: HIVTP achieves better accuracy and higher inference efficiency compared to prior works through hierarchical visual token pruning without requiring training.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

*Xixi Jiang,Chen Yang,Dong Zhang,Pingcheng Dong,Xin Yang,Kwang-Ting Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STIM-TM is a training-free token merging method for surgical video understanding that reduces computational costs by 65%+ GFLOPs while maintaining accuracy through spatiotemporal redundancy reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Transformer methods for surgical video understanding suffer from high computational costs due to processing massive spatiotemporal tokens, and existing token merging approaches fail to properly account for video structure and heterogeneous information distribution.

Method: STIM-TM uses a decoupled strategy: temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive frames using saliency weighting, while spatial component prioritizes merging static tokens through temporal stability analysis to protect dynamic surgical regions.

Result: Achieves over 65% GFLOPs reduction while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video tasks, and supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical videos.

Conclusion: STIM-TM effectively addresses computational bottlenecks in surgical video applications through spatiotemporal information mining, enabling efficient surgical video understanding without compromising performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCI is a new metric that measures whether multimodal benchmarks require global image understanding or can be solved with localized visual cues, revealing most current benchmarks favor localized reasoning with spatial biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal benchmarks don't distinguish between genuine global reasoning and success via localized visual cues, hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.

Method: Introduces Region Comprehension Index (RCI) - a model-based score that systematically compares reference-model performance on image patches versus full images to quantify reliance on global vs local visual information.

Result: Applied RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks and found most favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases, indicating potential risks in real-world applications.

Conclusion: RCI provides researchers with an actionable tool for diagnosing and mitigating spatial biases, enabling construction of better datasets and benchmarks for robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

*Dayu Tan,Ziwei Zhang,Yansan Su,Xin Peng,Yike Dai,Chunhou Zheng,Weimin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSD-KMamba is a 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework that combines bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale self-distillation to address computational complexity and global perception limitations in CNN-Transformer hybrid models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the high computational complexity and resource consumption of global attention mechanisms in CNN-Transformer hybrid models while maintaining high segmentation accuracy for complex tasks.

Method: Integrates bidirectional spatial perception branch for capturing long-range spatial context dependencies and nonlinear feature extraction, combined with multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy for hierarchical feature representations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy, robustness, and generalization on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining high computational efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances model performance with computational efficiency, addressing the limitations of existing methods in volumetric segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly
available at https://github.com/daimao-zhang/MSD-KMamba.

*Weilun Feng,Chuanguang Yang,Haotong Qin,Mingqiang Wu,Yuqi Li,Xiangqi Li,Zhulin An,Libo Huang,Yulun Zhang,Michele Magno,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantSparse is a unified framework that combines model quantization and attention sparsification to compress diffusion transformers for video generation, achieving significant efficiency gains without severe performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers have excellent video generation capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs, making practical deployment challenging. While quantization and sparsification individually show promise, each alone causes severe performance degradation under aggressive compression.

Method: QuantSparse integrates model quantization with attention sparsification through two key techniques: 1) Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation for mitigating quantization-induced bias using global structural guidance and local salient supervision, and 2) Second-Order Sparse Attention Reparameterization that exploits temporal stability of second-order residuals to recover information lost under sparsity.

Result: Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B show QuantSparse achieves 20.88 PSNR, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art quantization baseline Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while delivering 3.68× reduction in storage and 1.88× acceleration in end-to-end inference.

Conclusion: QuantSparse successfully combines quantization and sparsification to achieve compounded efficiency gains for diffusion transformers in video generation, overcoming the limitations of applying either technique alone.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}
reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end
inference. Our code will be released in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HomeSafeBench is a new benchmark for evaluating embodied agents' home safety inspection capabilities using dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated environments, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that use static viewpoints and textual descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual descriptions instead of visual information and restrict agents with single static viewpoints, causing omission of occluded safety hazards.

Method: Proposed HomeSafeBench with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards (fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, child safety), providing dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home environments that allow free exploration.

Result: Evaluation of mainstream VLMs shows poor performance - even the best model achieves only 10.23% F1-score, with models struggling particularly with hazard identification and exploration strategy selection.

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench reveals significant limitations in current VLMs for home safety inspection and provides valuable reference for future research, with dataset and code to be publicly available.

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

*Atharva Jadhav,Arush Karekar,Manas Divekar,Shachi Natu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensemble of SSD models with diverse backbones using Weighted Boxes Fusion improves weapon detection robustness in surveillance systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public safety requires robust weapon detection systems that can handle challenges like occlusion, varying lighting, and cluttered backgrounds where single-model detectors often fail.

Method: Multiple SSD models with different backbone networks (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileNetV3) were trained on weapon detection and combined using Weighted Boxes Fusion with max confidence scoring.

Result: The ensemble achieved mAP of 0.838, representing 2.948% improvement over the best single model, and consistently outperformed other fusion methods.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware fusion is critical for ensemble performance, providing a robust approach for real-time weapon detection in surveillance applications.

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

*Yunjiang Xu,Lingzhi Li,Jin Wang,Yupeng Ouyang,Benyuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSTINCT is a novel collaborative perception framework that improves LiDAR-based multi-agent detection while significantly reducing bandwidth requirements through instance-level interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative perception systems face bandwidth constraints due to frequent interactions and real-time requirements. Current LiDAR-focused implementations underperform compared to state-of-the-art methods despite the benefits of query-based instance-level interaction.

Method: INSTINCT features three core components: 1) quality-aware filtering for high-quality instance selection, 2) dual-branch detection routing to separate collaboration-relevant and irrelevant instances, and 3) Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion module for aggregating local hybrid instance features. Enhanced ground truth sampling is also used for training.

Result: The method achieves 13.23% improvement in DAIR-V2X and 33.08% improvement in V2V4Real datasets, while reducing communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: INSTINCT demonstrates superior performance in collaborative perception with significant accuracy improvements and dramatic bandwidth reduction, making it highly practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: CrimEdit is a unified diffusion model that jointly handles object removal and insertion tasks using classifier-free guidance, enabling efficient object movement in a single denoising step without separate training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored performance impact of classifier-free guidance on handling object effects in unified removal/insertion models and improve efficiency in composite editing tasks.

Method: Jointly trains task embeddings for removal and insertion in a single model, leverages them in classifier-free guidance scheme, and extends task prompts to spatially distinct regions for object movement.

Result: Achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal/insertion stages.

Conclusion: CrimEdit demonstrates that unified training with classifier-free guidance enables effective handling of object effects and efficient composite editing in a single model.

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

TL;DR: PD-Diag-Net is an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for Parkinson's disease that uses MRI scans with clinical prior knowledge integration, achieving 86% accuracy on external tests and over 96% for early-stage diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Parkinson's disease diagnostic workflows are complex, heavily reliant on neurologist expertise, and often result in delayed detection and missed early intervention opportunities.

Method: Proposes PD-Diag-Net framework with MRI preprocessing, Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior and Brain-Region-Aging-Prior integration, Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module, and Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module.

Result: Achieves 86% accuracy on external hospital test data and over 96% accuracy for early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing methods by more than 20%.

Conclusion: PD-Diag-Net provides an effective automated diagnostic solution for Parkinson's disease with high accuracy and clinical interpretability, addressing limitations of current diagnostic workflows.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

TL;DR: DiffPCN is a diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion that uses depth image projection and denoising to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models have strong generative capabilities but remain underexplored for point cloud completion due to the unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Project partial point clouds to depth images, use DepthLDM to generate completed depth images forming coarse point clouds; 2) Point Denoising Network removes artifacts and Association-Aware Point Upsampler refines with local association features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly improving robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Conclusion: DiffPCN effectively leverages diffusion models for point cloud completion through a structured coarse-to-fine approach that handles the irregular nature of point clouds while maintaining high quality and completeness.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

TL;DR: A training-free visual prompting method that combines multiple video frames into single panel images to improve long-video understanding in Video-Language Models without additional parameters or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-Language Models perform poorly on long-video understanding compared to images/short videos. Instead of complex model modifications, the authors aim to maximize existing model performance with minimal changes.

Method: Proposes a visual prompting strategy that trades spatial details for temporal resolution by combining multiple frames into one image panel. The approach is training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic.

Result: Extensive experiments on 5 benchmarks show consistent improvements across various model architectures and sizes. On TimeScope (Long) dataset with longest videos, video QA accuracy improved by up to 19.4%.

Conclusion: The method effectively raises performance bar for long video understanding models through simple yet effective visual prompting, demonstrating significant gains without model modifications.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3DLayout is a large-scale multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation, addressing limitations of existing datasets through 15,080 layouts with detailed text annotations from real scans, CAD designs, and procedural scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D indoor layout generation models are constrained by limited scale, diversity, and annotation quality of existing datasets, which hinders learning complex spatial and semantic patterns.

Method: Created M3DLayout dataset with 15,080 layouts from three sources (real-world scans, CAD designs, procedural scenes), each paired with structured text describing scene summaries, relational placements, and fine-grained arrangements. Established benchmark using text-conditioned diffusion model.

Result: The dataset provides a solid foundation for training layout generation models, with multi-source composition enhancing diversity. The Inf3DLayout subset enables generation of more complex and detailed scenes through rich small-object information.

Conclusion: M3DLayout serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis, addressing dataset limitations and enabling better learning of spatial and semantic patterns.

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed

### [337] [LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23729)
*Shubhang Bhatnagar,Andy Xu,Kar-Han Tan,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUQ is a layerwise ultra-low bit quantization method for multimodal LLMs that selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to resilient layers, reducing memory usage by 31-40% compared to 4-bit models while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs require huge memory and computational resources, but existing quantization methods are not well-explored for multimodal models. The high statistical variance and entropy of multimodal tokens make them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization.

Method: Proposed LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization that selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers with lower entropy activation distributions that are more resilient. Also uses mixed multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ to boost VQA performance.

Result: LUQ models use 40% and 31% less memory than 4-bit counterparts for LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL respectively, with less than 10% performance degradation on MME benchmark across 9 VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Layerwise selective quantization based on activation distribution characteristics enables effective ultra-low bit quantization for multimodal LLMs, significantly reducing memory requirements while preserving performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

*Cong Chen,Ziyuan Huang,Cheng Zou,Muzhi Zhu,Kaixiang Ji,Jiajia Liu,Jingdong Chen,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraTok is a multi-scale ViT-based tokenizer that uses multi-scale downsampling and scale-causal attention to improve image reconstruction and generation tasks, achieving significant performance gains over single-scale approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of single-scale representations in Vision Transformer tokenizers by enabling multi-scale modeling for better visual generation tasks.

Method: Uses multi-scale downsampling on token maps and a scale-causal attention mechanism that progressively flows information from low-resolution global features to high-resolution details.

Result: 27.2% improvement in rFID (1.47 → 1.07), 1.38× faster convergence, 18.9% boost in gFID (16.4 → 13.3), and achieves state-of-the-art rFID of 0.45 and gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers.

Conclusion: HieraTok is the first multi-scale ViT-based tokenizer that significantly advances visual generation tasks through its multi-scale design and attention mechanism.

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

*Guole Shen,Tianchen Deng,Yanbo Wang,Yongtao Chen,Yilin Shen,Jiuming Liu,Jingchuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRS-SLAM3R is an end-to-end SLAM framework that improves dense scene reconstruction by incorporating spatial memory and global consistency through transformer-based gated updates and submap partitioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DUSt3R-based methods only use image pairs for pointmap estimation, overlooking spatial memory and global consistency, leading to limitations in maintaining coherent 3D reconstructions across frames.

Method: Uses sequential input to incrementally estimate metric-scale point clouds in global coordinates, employs transformer-based gated update module for spatial memory management, partitions scene into submaps with local alignment, and registers all submaps into common world frame.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses global consistency issues in dense SLAM through spatial memory mechanisms and submap-based registration, demonstrating improved reconstruction quality.

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

*Xincheng Yao,Chao Shi,Muming Zhao,Guangtao Zhai,Chongyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ResAD++ for class-agnostic anomaly detection, using residual features and feature hypersphere constraints to achieve decorrelation and consistent scales across classes without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AD methods fail in new classes due to class-related feature correlation. Need for a model that generalizes across diverse classes without target data retraining.

Method: Learn residual feature distribution by subtracting normal reference features. Use feature hypersphere constraints for scale consistency. Enhanced with logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization feature matching.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on eight real-world AD datasets when directly applied to new classes, surpassing both competitors and the base ResAD model.

Conclusion: ResAD++ effectively addresses feature correlation issues in class-agnostic AD through residual features and scale constraints, achieving strong generalization without retraining.

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at

*Wenjie Yang,Zengfeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Poivre, a self-refining procedure for visual pointing that enables VLMs to iteratively refine coordinates through a Point, Visualize, then Refine approach using reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs perform poorly on visual pointing tasks compared to humans, mainly because they're required to complete pointing in a single step without visual feedback, unlike humans who can see their own fingers while pointing.

Method: Poivre procedure: first mark estimated point, then iteratively refine coordinates. Uses reinforcement learning with a designed process reward to incentivize self-refining ability.

Result: Poivre-7B achieves new state-of-the-art on Point-Bench, outperforming proprietary models like Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models like Molmo-72B by over 3%.

Conclusion: The self-refining procedure with RL training significantly improves visual pointing performance in VLMs, bridging the gap with human capabilities.

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's
capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions.

TL;DR: UniAlignment is a unified multimodal generation framework using a single diffusion transformer with dual-stream training for enhanced cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for multi-modal tasks rely heavily on vision-language models or modular designs, leading to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. There's a need for more unified and efficient solutions for advanced semantic comprehension across visual and textual modalities.

Method: Proposes UniAlignment framework with dual-stream diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment within a single diffusion transformer.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment outperforms existing baselines. A new benchmark called SemGen-Bench is introduced to evaluate multimodal semantic consistency under complex instructions.

Conclusion: UniAlignment shows significant potential of diffusion models in unified multimodal generation, achieving better cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenView++ improves contrastive learning through multi-source adaptive view generation and quality-driven learning, achieving significant gains in vision and vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning methods have limitations in both view construction (limited diversity and semantic corruption) and learning (lack of quality assessment, treating all pairs equally).

Method: Two innovations: 1) Multi-source adaptive view generation with dynamic parameter modulation across image/text/image-text strategies; 2) Quality-driven contrastive learning that assesses semantic alignment and diversity to reweight training contributions.

Result: +2.5% improvement on ImageNet linear classification over MoCov2; +12.31% average zero-shot classification accuracy over CLIP and +5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets; +3.2% improvement on Flickr30k text retrieval R@5.

Conclusion: GenView++ effectively addresses both view construction and learning quality assessment challenges in contrastive learning, demonstrating strong performance across vision and vision-language tasks.

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

*Yaya Zhao,Kaiqi Zhao,Zixuan Tang,Zhiyuan Liu,Xiaoling Lu,Yalei Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTGRR is a modality-tailored graph framework for urban region representation that addresses limitations in existing multimodal approaches by using specialized GNN architectures for different modality types and spatially-aware fusion mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based models for multimodal urban data use identical architectures across all modalities and neglect spatial heterogeneity during fusion, leading to suboptimal region representations.

Method: Categorizes modalities into aggregated-level and point-level groups, uses MoE GNN architecture with dedicated experts for aggregated modalities, dual-level GNN for point-level visual data, and spatially-aware multimodal fusion with dynamic region-specific weights.

Result: Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities and three tasks show MTGRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MTGRR effectively addresses modality-specific characteristics and spatial heterogeneity in urban region representation learning, demonstrating superior performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Texture Vector-Quantization and Reconstruction Aware Prediction to address quantization errors and sub-optimal training in VQ-based super-resolution models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQ-based methods suffer from large quantization errors due to rich visual signals and train predictors with code-level supervision that ignores reconstruction errors, leading to sub-optimal prior modeling.

Method: Introduces Texture Vector-Quantization that only models missing texture priors, and Reconstruction Aware Prediction using straight-through estimator to train index predictor with image-level supervision.

Result: The proposed TVQ&RAP model delivers photo-realistic super-resolution results with small computational cost.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses quantization and supervision issues in VQ-based visual prior modeling, achieving high-quality super-resolution efficiently.

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

TL;DR: GroupCoOp is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for vision-language models that uses group-specific text prompts to address spurious correlations from subgroup imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art debiasing performance while training only 0.016% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuned VLMs are vulnerable to spurious correlations from subgroup imbalance in training datasets, which leads to poor group robustness and neglect of minority groups.

Method: Proposes Group Context Optimization (GroupCoOp) that employs group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple classifiers. Uses the VLM's text encoder to discover effective group prompts even for groups with few training samples.

Result: Achieved best results on five benchmarks across five CLIP architectures, occasionally outperforming methods that fine-tune the entire network despite training only 0.016% of parameters.

Conclusion: GroupCoOp effectively addresses group imbalance issues in VLM fine-tuning through group-specific prompts, demonstrating strong debiasing performance with minimal parameter updates.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

TL;DR: A controllable framework for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation that fuses geometric and semantic attributes to create realistic 3D structures from 2D layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing urban modeling methods have limitations - image-based approaches lack geometric continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods overlook parcel semantics. There's a need for methods that combine both geometric and semantic control for large-scale urban generation.

Method: Fuses geometric and semantic attributes, introduces edge weights, embeds building height in the graph, and extends 2D layouts to 3D structures. Users can directly control output by modifying semantic attributes.

Result: The method produces valid, large-scale urban models that maintain geometric continuity and incorporate semantic information.

Conclusion: This framework provides an effective tool for data-driven urban planning and design by enabling controllable generation of realistic 3D urban layouts with both geometric and semantic conditioning.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric
continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural
relations yet overlook parcel semantics. We present a controllable framework
for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry
and semantics. By fusing geometric and semantic attributes, introducing edge
weights, and embedding building height in the graph, our method extends 2D
layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control
the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven
planning and design.

TL;DR: A multi-view quality control system using three cameras and advanced object detection algorithms to improve assembly line inspection accuracy by overcoming single-view limitations like occlusions and lighting issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-view imaging and manual inspection methods are prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, and lighting inconsistencies, requiring additional inspection stations that disrupt assembly lines and increase costs.

Method: Developed a multi-camera imaging system with three camera views and a tailored image fusion methodology that combines results from multiple views to resolve ambiguities and enhance detection reliability. Created a unique annotated dataset with diverse scenarios.

Result: Significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and recall rates in identifying improperly fastened small assembly parts like screws.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate quality control mechanism that overcomes single-view limitations, ensuring reliability and safety of assembly lines. The dataset is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to
facilitate further research in this domain.

*Efthymios Tsaprazlis,Tiantian Feng,Anil Ramakrishna,Rahul Gupta,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines how LLMs and VLMs understand privacy concepts, introduces a visual privacy taxonomy, and evaluates current models' privacy awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models show impressive capabilities but lack understanding of privacy principles, creating a need to test and improve their privacy awareness.

Method: Developed a comprehensive Visual Privacy Taxonomy and evaluated state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models on their privacy understanding.

Result: Found significant inconsistencies in VLMs' understanding of contextual privacy, revealing current limitations.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems, and the taxonomy provides a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

### [353] [Uni4D-LLM: A Unified SpatioTemporal-Aware VLM for 4D Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23828)
*Hanyu Zhou,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni4D-LLM is a unified vision-language model framework that enables both 4D scene understanding and generation within a single Transformer-based architecture, addressing the paradigm gap between autoregressive and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D/4D approaches use separate models for scene understanding (autoregressive) and generation (diffusion), preventing unified handling of both tasks, especially in dynamic 4D settings requiring spatiotemporal modeling.

Method: Extracts semantic features for understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation, incorporates 4D geometric cues, fuses them through adaptive cross-attention into spatiotemporal-aware visual representation, and integrates both tasks into a single LLM with task-specific heads.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmarks, offering the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Conclusion: Uni4D-LLM successfully demonstrates that both understanding and generation tasks can be unified within one Transformer-based framework through shared representation and architecture design, with instruction fine-tuning improving generalization.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

*Zhixiong Zhang,Shuangrui Ding,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the Segment Concept (SeC) framework's zero-shot performance on the MOSEv2 dataset, achieving 39.7 JFn and ranking 2nd in the Complex VOS track without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous semi-supervised VOS methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and lack robustness against visual changes, occlusions, and scene shifts due to insufficient high-level conceptual understanding of targets.

Method: Uses the Segment Concept (SeC) framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to establish deep semantic understanding of objects for more persistent segmentation.

Result: Achieved 39.7 JFn on the MOSEv2 test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the 7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge without any fine-tuning on the training set.

Conclusion: The SeC framework demonstrates strong zero-shot performance by using semantic understanding from LVLMs, addressing limitations of appearance-based methods in complex video object segmentation scenarios.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

*Bingyang Cui,Yujie Zhang,Qi Yang,Zhu Li,Yiling Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional Text-to-3D generation, and proposes Rank2Score, a two-stage training evaluator that outperforms existing metrics for T23D quality assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-3D quality assessment faces challenges including outdated/fragmented benchmarks and limitations in objective metrics that lead to non-representative feature extraction and reduced robustness.

Method: Created T23D-CompBench with 5 components and 12 sub-components for compositional prompts, generating 3,600 textured meshes from 10 SOTA models. Proposed Rank2Score with two-stage training: supervised contrastive regression with curriculum learning in stage 1, and mean opinion score refinement in stage 2.

Result: Collected 129,600 reliable human ratings through large-scale subjective experiments. Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing metrics across multiple dimensions and can serve as a reward function to optimize generative models.

Conclusion: The introduced benchmark and Rank2Score method effectively address limitations in T23D quality assessment, providing better alignment with human judgments and demonstrating practical utility in downstream applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

*Michihiro Kuroki,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CE-FAM is a concept-based explanation method that identifies what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions, using a branched network that leverages VLM embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing saliency maps only highlight important regions without explaining their meaning, while concept-based explanations lack the ability to simultaneously reveal learned concepts, their regions, and contributions to predictions.

Method: Uses a branched network that shares activation maps with the image classifier and learns to mimic VLM embeddings. Concept regions are represented by weighted sums of activation maps using gradient-based weights, and contributions are quantified by impact on classification scores.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, excels in zero-shot inference for unseen concepts, and provides a general framework that doesn't require annotated datasets.

Conclusion: CE-FAM successfully addresses the limitations of existing explanation methods by providing comprehensive concept-based explanations that reveal learned concepts, their regions, and contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge for arbitrary concepts.

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

### [357] [FairViT-GAN: A Hybrid Vision Transformer with Adversarial Debiasing for Fair and Explainable Facial Beauty Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23859)
*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairViT-GAN is a novel hybrid framework combining CNN and ViT for facial beauty prediction, with adversarial debiasing to mitigate demographic biases and achieve state-of-the-art performance while improving fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FBP models have limitations including architectural constraints (CNNs struggle with global harmony, ViTs miss fine details), demographic biases, and lack of transparency. Models can inadvertently learn societal biases related to protected attributes.

Method: Proposes FairViT-GAN: hybrid framework with CNN branch for local feature extraction and ViT branch for global context modeling, plus adversarial debiasing mechanism to train feature extractor for protected attribute-invariant representations.

Result: Achieves SOTA predictive accuracy: Pearson Correlation 0.9230, RMSE 0.2650 on SCUT-FBP5500. Shows 82.9% reduction in performance gap between ethnic subgroups, with adversary classification accuracy dropping to 52.1% (near-random).

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN provides robust, transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for responsible AI systems in subjective visual assessment, effectively addressing both accuracy and fairness challenges.

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

*Jiajin Tang,Zhengxuan Wei,Yuchen Zhu,Cheng Shi,Guanbin Li,Liang Lin,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sim-DETR improves temporal sentence grounding by addressing query conflicts in DETR through constrained self-attention and query-to-frame alignment, unlocking DETR's full potential for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DETR enhancement strategies don't work well for temporal sentence grounding and may even degrade performance due to query conflicts between similar target moments and internal conflicts between global semantics and local localization.

Method: Extends standard DETR with two modifications: (1) constraining self-attention between queries based on semantic and positional overlap, and (2) adding query-to-frame alignment to bridge global and local contexts.

Result: Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal sentence grounding, demonstrating improved performance compared to standard DETR approaches.

Conclusion: Sim-DETR provides a simple yet powerful baseline that effectively addresses query conflicts in DETR for temporal sentence grounding, offering a strong foundation for future research in this area.

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

TL;DR: Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG) addresses information inconsistencies in autoregressive image generation by anchoring guidance to semantically important regions through attention, improving image quality and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for image generation suffer from information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps due to progressive resolution scaling, which scatters guidance signals and leads to ambiguous, unfaithful features.

Method: Proposed Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG) that adaptively reinforces informative patches during sampling by anchoring guidance to semantically important regions through attention mechanisms.

Result: IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically grounded images across both class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

Conclusion: IGG effectively tackles the critical weakness of information inconsistencies in autoregressive image generation, ensuring guidance and content remain tightly aligned for improved image quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCRI is a new metric to measure MLLM robustness to visual context variations by comparing performance on image patches vs full images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM evaluation metrics don't capture sensitivity to irrelevant visual context, limiting reliability in real-world settings.

Method: PCRI systematically quantifies robustness by measuring performance changes between localized image patches and full-image input across multiple benchmarks.

Result: Most leading MLLMs are brittle to background noise, with only a few models like InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B showing consistent robustness across tasks.

Conclusion: PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting better model selection and guiding development of more robust architectures for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

*Taehun Kong,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a learnable pseudo-labeling module for semi-supervised 3D object detection that automatically selects high-quality pseudo-labels using context-adaptive thresholds and score fusion, with soft supervision to handle noisy labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SS3DOD methods inadequately assess pseudo-label quality using manual thresholds and overlook contextual information like object distances, classes, and learning states, leading to suboptimal pseudo-label selection.

Method: Introduces two networks at teacher output level for reliable pseudo-label quality assessment through score fusion and context-adaptive thresholds, supervised by pseudo-label alignment with GT boxes, plus soft supervision strategy for robust learning under noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo datasets show the method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining wider context coverage and higher recall, significantly improving SS3DOD performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses pseudo-label selection challenges in SS3DOD through learnable adaptive thresholds and robust supervision, achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

### [362] [Tunable-Generalization Diffusion Powered by Self-Supervised Contextual Sub-Data for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23885)
*Guoquan Wei,Zekun Zhou,Liu Shi,Wenzhe Shan,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperDiff is a self-supervised tunable-generalization diffusion method for low-dose CT denoising that requires only LDCT projection data, combining contextual sub-data similarity sensing with latent diffusion models and pixel-level self-correcting fusion for enhanced reconstruction and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for low-dose CT denoising rely on paired data and generalize poorly, while diffusion models require clean data distribution learning which is difficult in clinical applications. Self-supervised methods also face generalization challenges when expanding to other doses.

Method: Proposes SuperDiff with: 1) contextual sub-data similarity adaptive sensing for denoising in LDCT projection domain, 2) knowledge distillation combined with latent diffusion models for detail optimization, 3) pixel-level self-correcting fusion for fine-grained reconstruction using initial prior and LDCT image as guide, 4) flexible application to dose generalization.

Result: SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on datasets and real data, showing superior reconstruction and generalization performance.

Conclusion: SuperDiff provides an effective self-supervised solution for low-dose CT denoising that requires only LDCT projection data, achieves superior performance, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across different dose levels including unseen doses.

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

### [363] [AssemblyHands-X: Modeling 3D Hand-Body Coordination for Understanding Bimanual Human Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23888)
*Tatsuro Banno,Takehiko Ohkawa,Ruicong Liu,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AssemblyHands-X is the first markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, showing that joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action recognition over using hands or body alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack kinematic-level annotations for both hands and body simultaneously, and marker-based systems introduce visual artifacts that limit generalization to natural videos.

Method: Constructed a pipeline combining multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh fitting for reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body from synchronized multi-view videos.

Result: Pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video baselines, and joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action recognition performance.

Conclusion: Modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics is crucial for holistic understanding of bimanual activities, highlighting the importance of hand-body coordination in action recognition.

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

### [365] [Preserving Cross-Modal Stability for Visual Unlearning in Multimodal Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23895)
*Jinghan Xu Yuyang Zhang Qixuan Cai Jiancheng Chen Keqiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCU is a cross-modal contrastive unlearning framework that addresses privacy leakage in multimodal systems by selectively unlearning visual data while preserving cross-modal knowledge and structural stability of retained data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual modality is most vulnerable to privacy leakage in multimodal applications, and existing unlearning methods fail to preserve cross-modal knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability during visual unlearning.

Method: Proposes Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning (CCU) with three components: selective visual unlearning using inverse contrastive learning, cross-modal knowledge retention through semantic consistency, and dual-set contrastive separation to isolate structural perturbations.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show CCU achieves 7.12% accuracy improvement with only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Conclusion: CCU effectively addresses privacy concerns in multimodal systems while maintaining model performance and cross-modal knowledge, demonstrating superior efficiency and accuracy over existing methods.

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

TL;DR: Q-FSRU combines frequency domain processing with quantum-inspired retrieval to improve medical VQA performance and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving tough clinical questions requiring both image and text understanding is a major challenge in healthcare AI.

Method: Uses Fast Fourier Transform to shift features to frequency domain, then combines with quantum retrieval-augmented generation that fetches medical facts using quantum-based similarity techniques.

Result: Outperforms earlier models on VQA-RAD dataset, especially on complex cases needing image-text reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and helpful AI tools for doctors by combining frequency and quantum information.

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

TL;DR: A continual learning framework for medical imaging that uses class-conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation to adapt models over time without storing patient data, achieving near-joint training performance while being privacy-preserving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging foundation models need to adapt over time, but full retraining is often prevented by privacy constraints and high costs, requiring a solution that avoids storing patient exemplars.

Method: Pairs class-conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation using a compact Vision Transformer backbone, evaluated across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and CheXpert dataset.

Result: Achieves 0.851 AUROC on CheXpert, reduces forgetting by more than 30% relative to DER++, and approaches joint training performance (0.869 AUROC) while remaining efficient and privacy-preserving.

Conclusion: Provides a practical route for scalable, privacy-aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models, with analyses showing forgetting is connected to replay fidelity and Fisher-weighted parameter drift.

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,
privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

TL;DR: Proposes FedDA, a federated domain adaptation framework for cross-domain medical image segmentation that uses feature-level adversarial learning to align feature maps across clients with different medical image modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of modality heterogeneity in federated learning for medical imaging, where different clients possess different types of medical images due to resource imbalance or data issues.

Method: Feature-level adversarial learning among clients by aligning feature maps through embedding an adversarial training mechanism to enhance model generalization across multiple domains.

Result: FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain federated aggregation, enables single modality clients with cross-modality processing capabilities, and delivers robust performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in objective and subjective assessments.

Conclusion: The proposed FedDA framework effectively addresses modality heterogeneity in federated medical image segmentation through domain adaptation, providing practical cross-modality processing capabilities while maintaining data privacy.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EditReward-Bench benchmark and EditScore reward models to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction-guided image editing by providing high-fidelity reward signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image editing models struggle with complex instructions and require multiple samples, while RL adoption is hindered by lack of effective reward signals.

Method: Developed EditReward-Bench benchmark and EditScore reward models (7B-72B) through meticulous data curation, with self-ensemble strategy for generative nature.

Result: EditScore matches proprietary VLM performance, largest variant surpasses GPT-5, and enables efficient RL policy optimization that substantially improves OmniGen2 base model.

Conclusion: High-fidelity, domain-specialized reward models are crucial for unlocking RL's full potential in image editing, providing systematic path from benchmarking to RL training.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

*Xiyan Xu,Sirui Xu,Yu-Xiong Wang,Liang-Yan Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoReact is a diffusion-based method for text-driven human reaction generation that sequentially generates global trajectories and local motions to create realistic, diverse reactions that match counterpart movements and textual descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to integrate rich semantic information and lack adaptive responsiveness to diverse interaction scenarios. Current approaches either treat multiple individuals as a single entity or rely solely on one person's motion, missing the semantic underpinnings of human interactions.

Method: MoReact uses a diffusion-based approach that disentangles global trajectory generation from local motion generation sequentially. It first generates global trajectories to guide local motion, ensuring better alignment with actions and text. The method also introduces a novel interaction loss to enhance realism in close interactions.

Result: Experiments using adapted two-person motion data show MoReact can produce realistic, diverse, and controllable reactions that closely match counterpart movements while adhering to textual guidance.

Conclusion: MoReact effectively addresses the limitations of existing models by focusing on text-driven human reaction generation, producing semantically appropriate and realistic motion sequences that complement opponent movements based on interaction descriptions.

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-task learning suffers from optimization imbalance where task interference reduces performance. Analysis shows gradient norm correlates with imbalance, and scaling losses by gradient norms achieves results comparable to expensive grid search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the persistent problem of unbalanced optimization in multi-task learning that leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models.

Method: Systematic experimental analysis examining factors contributing to optimization imbalance, including testing existing optimization methods across datasets, analyzing Vision Foundation Models, and investigating gradient dynamics.

Result: Found strong correlation between optimization imbalance and task-specific gradient norms. Demonstrated that scaling task losses according to gradient norms achieves performance comparable to computationally expensive grid search.

Conclusion: Understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a more direct path to stable multi-task learning than developing increasingly complex methods.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

*Kuanrong Liu,Siyuan Liang,Cheng Qian,Ming Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes adversarial example transfer across CLIP-based models in different tasks, finding that fine-grained tasks generate stronger transferable attacks. It proposes MT-AdvCLIP framework to enhance cross-task adversarial transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP shows strong generalization but struggles with fine-grained tasks and its adversarial robustness is underexplored. Understanding cross-task adversarial transfer is crucial for assessing CLIP's security risks and generalization limits.

Method: Proposes MT-AdvCLIP framework with task-aware feature aggregation loss to generate perturbations with enhanced cross-task generalization capability, strengthening attack effectiveness from fine-grained tasks on shared CLIP backbone.

Result: MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves adversarial transfer success rate by over 39% on average across multiple tasks against various CLIP-derived models without increasing perturbation budget.

Conclusion: The study reveals adversarial transfer mechanisms in multi-task CLIP models and provides insights for multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

*Longtao Jiang,Mingfei Han,Lei Chen,Yongqiang Yu,Feng Zhao,Xiaojun Chang,Zhihui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Token Painter is a training-free text-guided image inpainting method that uses Mask AutoRegressive models with dual-stream encoder fusion and adaptive decoder attention enhancement to generate prompt-faithful content while maintaining background consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based methods struggle with aligning inpainting results with text prompts and maintaining background consistency due to modeling the entire image in latent space. MAR models offer better local controllability but tend to ignore prompts or create disharmonious results.

Method: Proposes Token Painter with two key components: Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF) to fuse text and background information in frequency domain, and Adaptive Decoder Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE) to enhance attention on guidance and inpainting tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results.

Conclusion: The training-free Token Painter approach effectively addresses text-prompt alignment and background consistency issues in image inpainting through MAR-based architecture with novel fusion and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

TL;DR: A closed-loop evaluation framework for autonomous driving that integrates real-world traffic scenarios into CARLA simulator using infrastructure sensors and digital twins of intersections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CARLA benchmarks use manually configured traffic scenarios that diverge from real-world conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance.

Method: Extracted 800 dynamic traffic scenarios from 100-hour infrastructure sensor videos and created static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent visual appearance in CARLA.

Result: Created a challenging evaluation framework that replicates real-world traffic and environmental characteristics, including diverse driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day at complex urban intersections.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models that better reflects real-world driving conditions.

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

*Alexandros Doumanoglou,Kurt Driessens,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to identify encoding and decoding direction pairs in deep vision networks, enabling concept-level interpretation and model correction through directional clustering and signal vector estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To open the black box of deep networks by recovering interpretable concept embeddings and latent factors, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models through concept-level analysis.

Method: Uses directional clustering of activations to identify decoding directions and estimates encoding directions with signal vectors under a probabilistic view, leveraging network weights through Uncertainty Region Alignment.

Result: Successfully recovers ground-truth direction pairs on synthetic data, identifies monosemantic interpretable concepts on real data outperforming baselines, and validates encoding direction estimation via activation maximization.

Conclusion: The approach enables practical applications in understanding model behavior, explaining predictions, and intervening for counterfactuals or error correction through concept-level manipulation.

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

Method: Constructed SAR-GEOVL-1M dataset with geographic projection properties; generated aligned structured text through hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought; designed Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism for cross-modal alignment through contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning.

Result: SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading performance across 11 downstream vision and vision-language tasks compared to 14 leading foundation models, particularly excelling in object counting and land-cover classification.

Conclusion: SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces

### [378] [AutoPrune: Each Complexity Deserves a Pruning Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23931)
*Hanshi Wang,Yuhao Xu,Zekun Xu,Jin Gao,Yufan Liu,Weiming Hu,Ke Wang,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoPrune is a training-free framework that adaptively prunes visual tokens in vision-language models based on sample and task complexity, achieving 89% token reduction with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods use fixed, heuristic strategies that don't align with the model's reasoning trajectory, failing to accommodate diverse input complexities.

Method: Quantifies mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve that adapts to different task complexities.

Result: On LLaVA-1.5-7B, prunes 89% of visual tokens, reduces FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% original accuracy, outperforming PDrop by 9.1%.

Conclusion: AutoPrune effectively reduces computational demands while maintaining performance by adapting pruning policies to varying complexities.

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

*Dragoş-Andrei Chileban,Andrei-Ştefan Bulzan,Cosmin Cernǎzanu-Glǎvan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automatic car damage detection pipeline using 3D Gaussian Splatting for single-view 3D segmentation, enabling damage detection from limited views where multi-view approaches fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic car damage detection methods rely on 2D image analysis, missing the benefits of 3D reconstruction. 3D methods provide more comprehensive and geometrically accurate damage representation, especially important for insurance applications requiring fast and accurate assessments.

Method: Proposes a pipeline that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Uses a learning-free approach for single-view 3D Gaussian Splatting segmentation: Gaussians are projected onto image plane using SfM camera parameters, then filtered through Z-buffering with normal distribution modeling of depth and opacities.

Result: The method is particularly effective for challenging car damage scenarios where target objects (scratches, small dents) may only be clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches impractical.

Conclusion: The proposed single-view 3D Gaussian Splatting segmentation approach enables effective car damage detection in scenarios where traditional multi-view methods fail, providing a practical solution for real-world insurance applications.

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing REC and REG datasets rely on manual annotation which is labor-intensive and difficult to scale, creating a need for automated data generation methods.

Method: Uses Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy with MLLMs and LLMs for description generation, and Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial expressiveness among duplicate instances.

Result: ColLab significantly accelerates annotation process while improving quality and discriminability of generated expressions, and was adopted in ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge data pipeline.

Conclusion: The framework enables fully automated REC and REG data generation, producing diverse and challenging samples that better reflect real-world reasoning demands.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial
progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data
generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a
Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the
semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large
language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a
module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in
the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal

### [382] [Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards for World Model Post-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23958)
*Yang Ye,Tianyu He,Shuo Yang,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLIR is a post-training framework that uses inverse dynamics models to derive verifiable reward signals from generated videos, improving action-following capability in video world models without requiring expensive preference annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video world models have improved visual quality but struggle with accurately modeling human-specified actions. Traditional reinforcement learning methods are impractical due to high costs of preference annotations and inability to construct rule-based video verifiers.

Method: RLIR uses an Inverse Dynamics Model to recover input actions from generated videos, mapping high-dimensional video modality to low-dimensional action space. This provides objective, verifiable rewards for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Experiments show 5-10% gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher human preference scores across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms.

Conclusion: RLIR is the first post-training method specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models, providing an effective solution without requiring expensive preference annotations.

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

TL;DR: An intelligent thyroid cancer classification method combining adaptive CNN with CDF9/7 wavelets modulated by chaotic systems achieves 98.17% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective thyroid cancer treatment and improved patient outcomes, addressing the global rise in thyroid cancer cases.

Method: Couples an Adaptive CNN with CDF9/7 wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll chaotic system to enrich discriminative features, evaluated on DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset using 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: Achieves 98.17% accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and AUC of 0.9912. Chaotic modulation improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points. Outperforms EfficientNetV2-S, Swin-T, ViT-B/16, and ConvNeXt-T backbones. Computationally efficient (28.7 ms per image).

Conclusion: The wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

TL;DR: VFSI enforces physical constraints during diffusion sampling to fix systematic violations in traffic simulation models, reducing collisions by 67% and improving overall validity by 87% without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for traffic simulation systematically violate physical constraints, with 50% of trajectories showing collisions, off-road driving, and impossible vehicle spawns, treating physical validity as emergent rather than required.

Method: Proposes Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI) that uses energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling to enforce collision avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, guiding denoising toward physically valid trajectories.

Result: Across 200 urban scenarios, VFSI reduced collision rates from 24.6% to 8.1% (67% reduction) and improved overall validity from 50.3% to 94.2% (87% improvement), while also improving realism metrics (ADE from 1.34m to 1.21m).

Conclusion: Explicit constraint enforcement during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation, and the model-agnostic approach works without retraining existing models.

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

TL;DR: OASIS is an efficient one-step diffusion model with attention specialization for real-world video super-resolution that reduces computational redundancy while achieving state-of-the-art performance and 6.2× speedup over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct adaptation of diffusion models to video super-resolution creates redundancy since low-quality videos already contain substantial content information, leading to increased computational overhead and learning burden.

Method: Proposes attention specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns according to their intrinsic behaviors, and a progressive training strategy starting with temporally consistent degradations then shifting to inconsistent settings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with 6.2× speedup over one-step diffusion baselines like SeedVR2.

Conclusion: OASIS effectively mitigates redundancy in diffusion models for VSR while preserving pretrained knowledge, enabling better adaptation to video super-resolution tasks with superior efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains creates demand for robust depth estimation techniques, but obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth estimation remains challenging.

Method: Converts 360 images to six-face cubemap representations, uses perspective foundation models to estimate depth and surface normals, and introduces graph-based optimization with per-face scale parameters to ensure depth scale consistency across cubemap faces while preserving 3D structural integrity.

Result: Achieves superior performance across diverse datasets (Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, 360Loc) and demonstrates benefits in downstream tasks: feature matching (3.2-5.4% improvement) and Structure from Motion (0.2-9.7% improvement in AUC@5).

Conclusion: RPG360 provides a robust, training-free solution for 360 monocular depth estimation that leverages foundation models' zero-shot robustness and graph optimization to overcome depth scale inconsistencies, showing strong performance across multiple datasets and downstream applications.

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

Conclusion: SMART-R1 demonstrates that the simple yet powerful R1-style training framework effectively enhances foundation models for multi-agent traffic simulation, improving alignment with human preferences and evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world

shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an

Conclusion: TREAT-Net shows potential as a non-invasive tool for accurate ACS patient triage, especially beneficial for underserved populations with limited angiography access.

Abstract: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing Acute Coronary
Syndrome (ACS). However, its resource-intensive and invasive nature can expose
patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed
treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep
learning framework for ACS treatment prediction that leverages non-invasive
modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video
interpretation, along with a late fusion mechanism to align predictions across
modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms
unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an
AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy
for intervention prediction. These findings highlight the potential of
TREAT-Net as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate patient triage,

*Zhiqi Huang,Dulongkai Cui,Jinglu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIE3D generates expressive 3D head avatars from a single image and text description, enabling fine-grained control over facial expressions through a novel conditioning scheme and perceptual expression loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via text when generating 3D head avatars from single images.

Method: Fuses identity features from images with semantic text embeddings through a novel conditioning scheme, and introduces a perceptual expression loss using a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize generation.

Result: Significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a single consumer-grade GPU.

Conclusion: SIE3D provides an effective framework for generating expressive 3D avatars with detailed text-based expression control while maintaining high fidelity and identity preservation.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,
as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via
text. This paper proposes SIE3D, a framework that generates expressive 3D
avatars from a single image and descriptive text. SIE3D fuses identity features
from the image with semantic embedding from text through a novel conditioning
scheme, enabling detailed control. To ensure generated expressions accurately
match the text, it introduces an innovative perceptual expression loss
function. This loss uses a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize the
generation process, guaranteeing expression accuracy. Extensive experiments
show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming
competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a
single consumer-grade GPU. Project page:

### [391] [FrameMind: Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought for Video Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24008)
*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Kai-Wei Chang,Hang Wu,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameMind is a reinforcement learning framework that enables dynamic frame sampling for video understanding, allowing models to adaptively request visual information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding models use fixed frame sampling strategies that cannot adapt to specific reasoning requirements, limiting performance on tasks needing either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail.

Method: FrameMind uses Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT) for multi-turn reasoning, alternating between textual reasoning and active visual perception. It employs Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS) and DRFS-GRPO policy optimization algorithm to train dynamic sampling policies without frame-level annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments on MLVU and VideoMME benchmarks show FrameMind significantly outperforms existing models and advances state-of-the-art in flexible and efficient video understanding.

Conclusion: FrameMind demonstrates that dynamic, adaptive frame sampling through reinforcement learning enables more effective video understanding compared to traditional static approaches.

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

### [392] [Generalized Category Discovery in Hyperspectral Images via Prototype Subspace Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24017)
*Xianlu Li,Nicolas Nadisic,Shaoguang Huang,Aleksandra Pizurica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes the first Generalized Category Discovery framework for hyperspectral images using prototype subspace modeling with basis vectors instead of single prototypes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods designed for RGB images don't generalize well to hyperspectral images due to their high-dimensional nature and complex spectral structures, creating a need for specialized HSI GCD approaches.

Method: Uses prototype subspace modeling with basis vectors per category, enforced by two constraints: basis orthogonality for inter-class separability and reconstruction constraint for effective sample representation.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD methods on real-world HSI datasets, establishing strong foundation for HSI category discovery.

Conclusion: The proposed subspace-based prototype modeling effectively addresses the unique challenges of hyperspectral images in generalized category discovery, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

*Jian Chen,Zhuoran Zheng,Han Hu,Guijuan Zhang,Dianjie Lu,Liang Li,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning model combining atmospheric scattering physics with pedestrian interaction modeling for trajectory prediction in hazy weather, achieving significant performance improvements in dense haze scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address physical information degradation and ineffective pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy weather conditions.

Method: Combines differentiable atmospheric scattering model for haze mitigation, adaptive Mamba variant for feature extraction, and heterogeneous graph attention network with spatio-temporal fusion for pedestrian relationship modeling.

Result: Reduces minADE/minFDE by 37.2%/41.5% in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m) compared to SOTA, with 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba.

Conclusion: Provides a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

*Nate Rothschild,Moshe Kimhi,Avi Mendelson,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior image reconstruction compared to post-ISP sRGB images, as demonstrated through rain removal tasks using a new benchmark dataset and evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, which irreversibly mix colors, clip dynamic range, and blur fine detail. The paper aims to show these losses are avoidable by working directly with raw sensor data.

Method: Evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction pipelines, curate Raw-Rain benchmark (first public dataset of real rainy scenes in 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB), and introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS) as a color-invariant evaluation metric.

Result: Raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2% ICS on test split, while running faster with half the GFLOPs compared to post-ISP approaches.

Conclusion: Advocates for an ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision tasks and opens the door to end-to-end learnable camera pipelines by demonstrating superior performance when learning directly from raw sensor data.

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end
learnable camera pipelines.

### [395] [Joint Superpixel and Self-Representation Learning for Scalable Hyperspectral Image Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24027)
*Xianlu Li,Nicolas Nadisic,Shaoguang Huang,Aleksandra Pizurica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for hyperspectral image analysis that jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering through a feedback mechanism, achieving superior clustering accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing superpixel-based subspace clustering methods perform segmentation independently from clustering, leading to misaligned partitions that don't support the clustering objective.

Method: End-to-end framework with a feedback mechanism where a self-representation network (based on unfolded ADMM) guides a differentiable superpixel module, enabling joint optimization and learning unique compactness parameters for each superpixel.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets show the method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed joint optimization framework produces clustering-aware partitions that preserve spectral and spatial structure while being more efficient and adaptive than existing methods.

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

*Leonardo Iurada,Beatrice Occhiena,Tatiana Tommasi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pruning pre-trained vision models on one task retains zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, and fine-tuning can recover performance on held-out tasks due to favorable loss landscapes from extensive pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of pruning pre-trained vision models when downstream tasks are unknown, investigating how data influences pruning and whether task-specific data is necessary.

Method: Pruning-at-Initialization approach applied to pre-trained vision models, analyzing pruning on one task and evaluating performance on both seen and unseen tasks with and without fine-tuning.

Result: Pruning on one task retains zero-shot performance on unseen tasks, and fine-tuning pruned models improves performance on original tasks while recovering performance on held-out tasks.

Conclusion: Extensive pre-training on large datasets creates favorable loss landscapes that enable effective pruning without requiring task-specific data, making pruning more practical for unknown downstream tasks.

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grounding IDs are latent identifiers that emerge when LVLMs use visual structures like partitions, improving multimodal binding by reducing modality gaps and strengthening attention between related components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why simple visual structures improve LVLM performance and uncover the internal mechanisms behind these gains in structured reasoning and precise grounding.

Method: Used representation analysis to study embedding space alignment and conducted causal interventions to verify how Grounding IDs mediate object-symbol binding across modalities.

Result: Found that Grounding IDs emerge as robust within-partition alignment, reduce modality gap, strengthen attention between related components, improve cross-modal grounding, and reduce hallucinations.

Conclusion: Grounding IDs are a key symbolic mechanism that explains how external visual cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and practical robustness improvements.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAR introduces a unified framework for video generation that challenges the conventional frame-by-frame approach by supporting multiple prediction units including spatiotemporal cubes, which outperform traditional methods in quality, speed, and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper questions whether frames are the appropriate atomic units for video autoregression, challenging the standard frame-by-frame approach used in current video generation models.

Method: VideoAR is a unified framework that supports various prediction units: full frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes. The key innovation is using spatiotemporal cubes that allow autoregressive models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.

Result: Cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior quality, speed, and temporal coherence. The method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench while achieving faster inference and enabling scaling to minute-long sequences.

Conclusion: By removing the frame-by-frame constraint, VideoAR demonstrates that spatiotemporal cubes are more effective prediction units, motivating rethinking of sequence decomposition in video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse modalities remains challenging in computer graphics and human-computer interaction.

Method: Leverages rectified flow for deterministic straight-line sampling paths between noise and data, uses RAG module with music features and LLM-based text decompositions, employs contrastive objective and synchronization loss for better alignment and coordination.

Result: Extensive evaluations show consistent gains in motion quality, responsiveness, and efficiency across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and multi-modal interactive benchmarks.

Conclusion: DualFlow produces temporally coherent and rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal human motion generation.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse
modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and
human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient
framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RVOS methods using MLLMs face challenges including insufficient exploitation of prior knowledge, high computational costs for long videos, and inadequate handling of complex temporal dynamics.

Method: SVAC uses Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal Compression (ASTC) to compress visual tokens while preserving spatio-temporal structure, and Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA) strategy to handle dynamic object behaviors across video clips.

Result: SVAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed SVAC model effectively addresses computational challenges while improving RVOS performance through enhanced video-language interaction and segmentation precision.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in
video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances
in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance
through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including
insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational
and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex
temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves
RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance
video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting
computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal
Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential
spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)
strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video
clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code

TL;DR: GMS is a coarse-to-fine framework that combines general vision-language models as 'Scanner' with specialized GUI grounding models as 'Locator' to improve GUI grounding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grounding natural language queries in GUIs is challenging due to diverse UI elements across applications and the need for precise spatial coordinate prediction.

Method: A synergistic framework with five stages using hierarchical search and cross-modal communication, where general VLMs scan for regions of interest and specialized models locate precise coordinates.

Result: GMS achieves 35.7% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro dataset, representing a 10x improvement over individual components (2.0% for Scanner, 3.7% for Locator) and outperforms other baselines.

Conclusion: GMS demonstrates robust performance and potential for general-purpose GUI grounding by effectively combining general and specialized models in a human-inspired approach.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Conclusion: EYE-DEX provides accurate automated retinal disease diagnosis with explainable AI features, enhancing clinician trust and reliability in AI-assisted diagnostics.

Abstract: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing
socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some
form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at
$411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by

has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and
achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an
automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale
Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and
ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global
benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability,
we integrate the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
technique to generate visual explanations highlighting disease-specific

TL;DR: AI facial beauty prediction models exhibit significant ethnicity-based bias, with both SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty-trained models showing prediction disparities across ethnic groups even on balanced datasets, amplifying societal beauty biases rather than mitigating them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and warn about bias in AI facial beauty prediction systems, which can shape aesthetic norms unequally, and to explore pathways toward more equitable beauty technologies.

Method: Comparative analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets using rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn analyses) and cross-dataset validation on the balanced FairFace dataset.

Result: Both models showed significant prediction disparities across ethnic groups (p < 0.001), with only 4.8-9.5% of inter-group comparisons satisfying distributional parity criteria. Cross-dataset validation revealed algorithmic amplification of societal beauty biases.

Conclusion: Current AI beauty prediction approaches are inadequate and tend to amplify rather than mitigate societal biases. The paper proposes and discusses mitigation strategies for more equitable beauty technologies.

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current
AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons
satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed
and discussed in detail.

TL;DR: FastVSR is a one-step diffusion model for video super-resolution that achieves significant speed improvements through high compression VAE (f16) and optimized training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based video super-resolution models have reduced sampling steps to one, but still have room for optimization in inference efficiency and computational cost.

Method: Uses high compression VAE with spatial compression ratio of 16 (f16), employs pixel shuffle and channel replication for upsampling, and implements lower-bound-guided training strategy for stable convergence.

Result: Achieves 111.9x speedup compared to multi-step models and 3.92x speedup compared to existing one-step models.

Conclusion: FastVSR demonstrates substantial improvements in inference efficiency for video super-resolution while maintaining performance through optimized VAE design and training strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

*Moxin Zhao,Nan Meng,Jason Pui Yin Cheung,Chris Yuk Kwan Tang,Chenxi Yu,Wenting Zhong,Pengyu Lu,Chang Shi,Yipeng Zhuang,Teng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatXGen is a generative framework that synthesizes lateral spinal radiographs from posterior RGBD images, enabling radiation-free sagittal alignment assessment for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiation-free methods focus mainly on coronal plane assessment, leaving reliable sagittal alignment evaluation largely unexplored without ionizing radiation.

Method: Dual-stage architecture with attention-based FFC module for anatomical feature integration and Spatial Deformation Network for morphological variations. Uses 3,264 paired RGBD-radiograph dataset.

Result: Produces anatomically accurate radiographs, outperforms existing GAN-based methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: Provides a promising radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis faces data sharing challenges due to privacy regulations and institutional protocols. Existing trajectory matching methods focus only on terminal states, missing important information from intermediate optimization states.

Method: Proposes shape-wise potential to capture geometric structure of parameter trajectories and easy-to-complex matching strategy that progressively addresses parameters based on complexity.

Result: Experiments on medical image classification tasks show improved distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model accuracy comparable to training on original datasets.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses limitations of existing trajectory matching approaches by capturing intermediate optimization states, enabling effective dataset distillation for medical images while maintaining privacy and accuracy.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to
privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation
offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,
overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address
this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric
structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy
that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments
on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves
distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model
accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets. Our code is available

### [409] [Combining Discrepancy-Confusion Uncertainty and Calibration Diversity for Active Fine-Grained Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24181)
*Yinghao Jin,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DECERN is a novel active learning method for fine-grained image classification that combines discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity to select the most informative samples under limited annotation budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In fine-grained image classification, assessing sample informativeness is challenging due to subtle inter-class differences, requiring specialized methods to effectively perceive distinctiveness between fine-grained images.

Method: DECERN uses a multifaceted informativeness measure combining discrepancy-confusion uncertainty (quantifying category directionality and structural stability) and calibration diversity (uncertainty-weighted clustering to diversify samples while maintaining local representativeness).

Result: Extensive experiments on 7 fine-grained image datasets across 26 experimental settings demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DECERN method effectively addresses the challenges of active learning in fine-grained image classification by combining uncertainty and diversity measures to select high-value samples.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Jonghun Kim,Inye Na,Eun Sook Ko,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A tumor-generation model using radiomics features as conditions to generate diverse 3D medical images, addressing privacy and data scarcity issues in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns make obtaining large 3D medical datasets challenging, and existing generative models lack output diversity for accurate 3D medical image representation.

Method: Combines GAN-based tumor mask generation with diffusion-based tumor texture generation, both conditioned on radiomics features (size, shape, texture) at arbitrary locations.

Result: Successfully tested on tumors in four organs (kidney, lung, breast, brain) across CT and MRI, with synthesized images aiding downstream task training and passing expert authenticity evaluations.

Conclusion: The method enables tumor manipulation and generation of various tumor types, showing potential for treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

*Jonghun Kim,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using diffusion models with prompt tuning to predict post-treatment breast cancer MRI images from pre-treatment images, incorporating clinical factors to improve NAC response prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response for breast cancer helps with treatment planning, and current monitoring using DCE-MRI could be enhanced by predictive modeling.

Method: Used maximum intensity projection images from DCE-MRI with diffusion models and introduced prompt tuning to incorporate clinical factors affecting NAC response.

Result: The model outperformed other generative models in image quality metrics and better reflected tumor size changes according to pathological complete response (pCR). Ablation studies validated the design choices.

Conclusion: The proposed method has potential to contribute to precision medicine by improving NAC response prediction through advanced image generation techniques.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.
Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the
potential to help with precision medicine.

### [412] [Talk in Pieces, See in Whole: Disentangling and Hierarchical Aggregating Representations for Language-based Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24192)
*Sojung An,Kwanyong Park,Yong Jae Lee,Donghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TaSe framework to address VLMs' limitations in handling complex queries with descriptive attributes and relations by disentangling text into objects, attributes, and relations, then hierarchically aggregating them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses due to text encoders treating sentences as bags-of-words, leading to false positives in object detection.

Method: TaSe framework with three components: hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset, Talk in Pieces module for disentangling text embeddings into objects/attributes/relations, and See in Whole module for hierarchical aggregation of components.

Result: Experimental results on OmniLabel benchmark show 24% performance improvement, demonstrating effectiveness of linguistic compositionality approach.

Conclusion: Disentangling and hierarchically structuring linguistic representations significantly improves VLMs' ability to handle complex queries for language-based object detection.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

### [413] [An Efficient 3D Latent Diffusion Model for T1-contrast Enhanced MRI Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24194)
*Zach Eidex,Mojtaba Safari,Jie Ding,Richard Qiu,Justin Roper,David Yu,Hui-Kuo Shu,Zhen Tian,Hui Mao,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D deep learning framework called T1C-RFlow generates synthetic T1-contrast enhanced MRI images from pre-contrast multiparametric MRI, eliminating the need for gadolinium-based contrast agents while achieving high-quality results faster than previous diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) used in T1-weighted MRI have limitations including risks of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in certain patients and imaging inconsistencies due to variations in GBCA administration. There is a need for contrast-agent-free alternatives.

Method: The T1C-RFlow model uses a 3D latent rectified flow approach. T1w and T2-FLAIR images are encoded into a latent space using a pretrained autoencoder, then a rectified flow diffusion model is trained in this latent space to generate T1C images. The model was trained on a large dataset of 4096 brain tumor patients (glioma, meningioma, metastases) split into train/validation/test sets.

Result: T1C-RFlow outperformed benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM, DiT-3D) with superior quantitative metrics: NMSE 0.044-0.098 and SSIM 0.905-0.937 across different tumor types. It achieved significantly faster denoising times (6.9 seconds/volume) compared to conventional DDPM models (37.7 seconds in latent space, 4.3 hours patch-based).

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C images in much less time than previous diffusion models, potentially enabling practical contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Motivation: Address challenges in unified video modeling: maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to text-visual token imbalance, and efficiently extending image-centric MLLMs to video without costly retraining.

Method: Couples MLLM with diffusion decoder through lightweight adapter; introduces Temperature Modality Alignment for prompt adherence and Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe selection.

Conclusion: UniVid provides an effective unified architecture for video understanding and generation with state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding
capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges:
maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to
text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal
attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric
MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified
architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a

introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and
Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe
selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total
score compared to EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BALR-SAM is a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical image segmentation by combining complementary detail enhancement, low-rank adapters, and efficient tensor attention, achieving SOTA performance with only 1.8% parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM struggle with medical image segmentation due to domain gap, and efficient fine-tuning for clinical practice with minimal resources while maintaining performance is challenging.

Method: Three components: (1) Complementary Detail Enhancement Network with depthwise separable convolutions for boundary features; (2) Low-rank adapters in ViT blocks for medical context optimization; (3) Low-rank tensor attention in mask decoder for memory efficiency.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods including fully fine-tuned MedSAM on medical segmentation datasets, while updating only 1.8% (11.7M) parameters, reducing memory usage by 75% and boosting inference speed.

Conclusion: BALR-SAM provides an efficient and effective adaptation framework for medical imaging that achieves superior performance with minimal parameter updates and resource demands.

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

TL;DR: Forge4D enables fast 4D human reconstruction from sparse-view videos, supporting both novel view and novel time synthesis through streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic 3D human reconstruction are either too slow or cannot generate novel-time representations, limiting downstream applications.

Method: Joint streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction with learnable state tokens for temporal consistency, and dense motion prediction with occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion for interpolation.

Result: Effective reconstruction and interpolation demonstrated on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: Forge4D addresses key limitations in 4D human reconstruction by enabling efficient novel view and novel time synthesis from uncalibrated sparse-view videos.

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

TL;DR: AVF-MAE++ is a scalable audio-visual masked autoencoder framework that addresses data limitations in affective video facial analysis through dual masking, enhanced correlation learning, and progressive training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limited data availability in affective video facial analysis and explore scaling properties while improving cross-modal correlation modeling between audio and visual modalities.

Method: Proposes AVF-MAE++ with dual masking strategy across modalities, strengthened modality encoders, Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, and progressive semantic injection strategy with three training stages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 17 datasets covering three major AVFA tasks, with comprehensive ablation studies validating each component's importance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates scalable pre-training for AVFA, with each proposed component contributing to improved performance and better cross-modal correlation learning.

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

Abstract: Despite the promise of foundation models in medical AI, current systems
remain limited - they are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning
processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present
EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify
broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and
testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global
datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties:
dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology.
External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional
datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to
assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with
pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation
for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858)
and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models.
In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across
nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External
validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with
competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training
strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not
only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step
reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early
multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that
could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world
clinical deployment.

*Seungwook Kim,Seunghyeon Lee,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two training-free inference techniques for robot video generation that actively use action parameters to guide diffusion models, improving action coherence and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build effective world models and robotics foundation models by generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories, moving beyond treating actions as passive conditioning signals.

Method: Two training-free inference-time techniques: 1) Action-scaled classifier-free guidance that modulates guidance strength based on action magnitude, and 2) Action-scaled noise truncation that adjusts initial noise sampling to align with motion dynamics.

Result: Experiments on real robot manipulation datasets show significant improvements in action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques successfully enhance robot video generation by actively incorporating action parameters into the diffusion process, providing better controllability over motion intensity and improved alignment with desired motion dynamics.

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

TL;DR: LVR enables autoregressive reasoning directly in visual embedding space, improving perception-intensive VQA tasks by interleaving latent visual reasoning with text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs confine reasoning to language space and treat visual information as static preconditions, limiting their visual understanding capabilities.

Method: Projects images into visual tokens in joint semantic space, trains language model to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual tokens, and adapts GRPO algorithm for reinforcement learning on latent reasoning.

Result: Achieves 71.67% on MMVP benchmark compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL, showing substantial gains in fine-grained visual understanding and perception.

Conclusion: LVR paradigm enables more effective visual reasoning by operating directly in visual embedding space, significantly enhancing multimodal models' perception capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CoTAM, an image codec tailored for Multimodal Large Language Models that adaptively protects multi-level features to achieve up to 35.99% bitrate savings while maintaining MLLM task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional image codecs are optimized for human visual fidelity but ill-suited for MLLMs, which require different feature-level preservation for diverse downstream tasks.

Method: Uses CLIP's shallow-layer attention to generate importance maps for bit allocation, and integrates a lightweight decoder adapter with multi-level loss function to reconstruct both low-level details and high-level semantics.

Result: Achieves up to 35.99% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on MLLM tasks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art neural codecs.

Conclusion: CoTAM effectively addresses the unique compression needs of MLLMs by adaptively protecting multi-level features, demonstrating significant bandwidth efficiency gains.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

TL;DR: S²NNs represent weights with less than one bit, using outlier-aware quantization and membrane potential-based distillation to achieve superior performance and efficiency compared to existing quantized SNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the storage and computational demands of large-scale Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for resource-limited edge computing applications, by exploring compression beyond binary representations.

Method: Proposes Sub-bit Spiking Neural Networks (S²NNs) with two key techniques: Outlier-aware Sub-bit Weight Quantization (OS-Quant) to mitigate codeword selection bias, and Membrane Potential-based Feature Distillation (MPFD) for improved performance guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments on vision and non-vision tasks show S²NNs outperform existing quantized SNNs in both performance and efficiency metrics.

Conclusion: S²NNs demonstrate promising potential for edge computing applications by achieving superior compression and acceleration while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality synthetic images in medical image generation remains challenging for both direct and counterfactual generation tasks.

Method: A cycle training framework that fine-tunes diffusion models with cycle constraints to enforce consistency between generated and original images.

Result: Experiments on 3D brain MRI datasets show improved conditioning accuracy and enhanced image quality measured by FID and SSIM metrics.

Conclusion: The cycle strategy in CDM effectively refines diffusion-based medical image generation for applications in data augmentation, counterfactual analysis, and disease progression modeling.

Abstract: Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality
synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge.
In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion
models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image
realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency
between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints,
enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a
combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and
PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image
quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,
counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

### [424] [Skeleton-based Robust Registration Framework for Corrupted 3D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24273)
*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhiqiang Tian,Jinling Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A skeleton-based robust registration framework (SRRF) is proposed to handle corrupted point clouds by using skeletal representations that improve registration robustness against density distortions, noise, and geometric deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world point clouds often suffer from sensor limitations, environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging. Existing methods relying on direct point matching or surface features are highly susceptible to these corruptions, leading to reduced alignment accuracy.

Method: The framework introduces a corruption-resilient skeletal representation and integrates skeletal structures into registration. It combines transformations from both corrupted point cloud alignment and skeleton alignment, using a distribution distance loss function to enforce consistency between source and target skeletons.

Result: Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets show SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods across various corruption scenarios including density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.

Conclusion: SRRF demonstrates robustness in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios by considering both local geometric features and global skeleton structure stability.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: CEGC is a confidence-driven framework for partial 3D point cloud registration that jointly models overlap confidence and correspondence reliability using global context to handle structural ambiguity and partial visibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial point cloud registration remains challenging due to structural ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise, requiring robust solutions for autonomous perception and 3D scene understanding.

Method: A unified framework with hybrid overlap confidence estimation (semantic descriptors + geometric similarity) and context-aware matching using global attention to assign soft confidence scores, guiding a differentiable weighted SVD solver.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes datasets in accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

Conclusion: CEGC provides an interpretable and scalable solution for partial point cloud registration under challenging conditions through its confidence-driven approach.

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging
conditions.

*Sai Raj Kishore Perla,Aditya Vora,Sauradip Nag,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASIA enables 3D segmentation of non-semantic parts using few image annotations, leveraging diffusion models to transfer segmentations from images to 3D objects with significant geometric differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D segmentation methods require multi-view images (hard to collect), 3D model annotations (demanding), or ambiguous text descriptions. ASIA uses easier-to-collect in-the-wild image annotations for more practical segmentation.

Method: Optimizes text tokens for each segment, fine-tunes with cross-view part correspondence loss, segments multi-view renderings, fuses labels in UV-space via voting, refines with Noise Optimization, and maps back to mesh.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, providing practical solution for semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation.

Conclusion: ASIA offers a generalizable framework for controllable 3D segmentation using few image annotations, effectively transferring segmentations from image space to 3D even with significant geometric differences.

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: SVGThinker is a reasoning-driven framework for text-to-SVG generation that improves generalization and instruction adherence by aligning SVG code production with the visualization process through chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent gaps in text-to-SVG generation: weak generalization and poor adherence to input instructions. Current methods struggle with producing stable, editable, and high-quality SVG outputs.

Method: A reasoning-driven framework that first renders each primitive sequentially, uses multimodal model to annotate image and code, builds stepwise updates mirroring incremental primitive addition, and trains LLM with supervised fine-tuning that exposes chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and higher-quality SVGs compared to state-of-the-art baselines while preserving structural advantages of vector graphics. Enables precise and hierarchical editing unlike image-based methods.

Conclusion: The framework opens new directions for design, content creation, and automated graphics generation by producing vector graphics that maintain editability and structural advantages while improving quality and instruction adherence.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

TL;DR: FrameThinker is a novel framework that enables Large Vision-Language Models to iteratively interrogate long videos through strategic frame selection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with long video reasoning due to inefficient uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inadequate for visually intensive video tasks.

Method: A two-phase training strategy: 1) Supervised Fine-Tuning to instill fundamental action capabilities, 2) Reinforcement Learning with comprehensive reward design to optimize strategic decision-making for frame selection.

Result: Achieves 76.1% accuracy on LongVideo-Reason using only 20.6 frames on average, outperforming LongVILA-R1 (72.0%) with over 20x fewer frames. Shows +10.4% average improvement across multiple benchmarks while drastically reducing processed frames.

Conclusion: FrameThinker demonstrates unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness in long video reasoning, establishing new state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMeGa is an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes triangle meshes and 2D Gaussian splats for improved indoor scene reconstruction, addressing geometry inaccuracies in texture-less regions and decoupled mesh extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering methods suffer from inaccurate geometry in texture-less indoor regions and decouple mesh extraction from optimization, missing opportunities to leverage mesh geometry for guiding splat optimization.

Method: Joint optimization of explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian splats via flexible binding strategy, integrating mesh constraints and monocular normal supervision, with iterative mesh-refinement through face splitting and pruning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on indoor reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-L1 by 47.3% over 2DGS baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality.

Conclusion: OMeGa effectively addresses prior limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction through joint mesh-splat optimization and refinement strategies.

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

Method: Three key components: (1) CryoEngine for large-scale synthetic data generation (904k subtomograms from 452 classes), (2) Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT) for improved robustness, (3) Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy for stable representation learning under noise.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on all three major subtomogram tasks (classification, alignment, averaging) across 24 synthetic and real datasets, with strong generalization to unseen datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed foundation model advances scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET by effectively addressing noise, annotation scarcity, and generalization challenges through synthetic data generation and specialized architectural innovations.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

Method: Uses selective state-space models (SSMs) with a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's linear-complexity algorithm to refine 4D correlation maps without compromising feature resolution or receptive field.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks.

Conclusion: MambaMatcher effectively overcomes limitations of both traditional feature-metric and recent correlation-metric methods by efficiently modeling high-dimensional correlations with linear complexity.

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet
challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance
visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while
recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs
due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel
method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling
high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By
implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's
linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map
effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field.
Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that
MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Sirui Chen,Yuhong Feng,Yifeng Wang,Jianghai Liao,Qi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TP-MVCC is a multi-view chicken counting model that uses tri-plane fusion and geometric projection to integrate features from multiple cameras onto a ground plane, achieving 95.1% accuracy in dense, occluded farming scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains challenging in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views.

Method: Proposes a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model that extracts single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a scene-level density map through geometric projection and tri-plane fusion.

Result: TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and conventional fusion methods, achieving 95.1% accuracy and strong robustness in dense, occluded scenarios.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates practical potential for intelligent agriculture by effectively addressing counting challenges in real farming conditions with the first multi-view silkie chicken dataset.

Abstract: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult
in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this,
we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which
leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from
multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts
single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a
scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct
the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions.
Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and
conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong
robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential
for intelligent agriculture.

*Guolin Ke,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereAR addresses variance collapse in autoregressive image generation by constraining VAE latents to a fixed-radius hypersphere, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores for AR models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models lag behind diffusion and masked-generation models in image generation due to heterogeneous variance in VAE latents that causes variance collapse during decoding, especially with classifier-free guidance.

Method: Proposes SphereAR which constrains all AR inputs and outputs to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere using hyperspherical VAEs, removing the scale component that causes variance collapse and stabilizing AR decoding.

Result: SphereAR-H (943M) achieves FID 1.34 on ImageNet generation, setting new SOTA for AR models. Smaller variants SphereAR-L (479M) and SphereAR-B (208M) achieve FID 1.54 and 1.92 respectively, matching or surpassing larger baselines.

Conclusion: SphereAR is the first pure next-token AR image generator with raster order to surpass diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter scales, demonstrating the effectiveness of hyperspherical constraints for stabilizing AR decoding.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

*Yan Ke,Xin Yu,Heming Du,Scott Chapman,Helen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework for agricultural visual question answering that handles multi-image inputs and incomplete evidence through self-reflection and iterative improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agricultural VQA approaches are limited to text-only queries or single images, failing to handle real-world scenarios with multi-image inputs across spatial scales and growth stages, and struggle with incomplete evidence due to limited external context access.

Method: A self-reflective multi-agent framework with four roles: Retriever (gathers external info), Reflector (assesses adequacy and triggers reformulation), Answerer (drafts candidate responses in parallel), and Improver (refines answers through iterative checks while aligning multi-image information).

Result: Experiments on AgMMU benchmark show competitive performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling context enrichment, reflective reasoning, and iterative improvement for multi-image agricultural visual question answering.

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

*Yixuan Ren,Hanyu Wang,Hao Chen,Bo He,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV-Diffusion is an implicit latent video diffusion model that generates videos by synthesizing neural network weights, which form an implicit neural representation (INR) that decodes videos from frame indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient and high-quality video synthesis by compressing and generating videos holistically as unified neural networks, avoiding temporal cross-frame attentions in denoisers and using dedicated decoders.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Hypernetwork-based tokenizer encodes videos from pixel space to neural parameter space, 2) Implicit diffusion transformer denoises latent INR weights. Uses weight reuse across layers, reformed weight assignment, upsampling connections, and SNR-adaptive loss weighting with scheduled sampling.

Result: Achieves superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and comparable performance to state-of-the-art non-implicit models on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 benchmarks. Creates smooth INR weight space enabling seamless interpolations.

Conclusion: NeRV-Diffusion demonstrates that generating videos via neural network weights in an implicit representation framework enables efficient, high-quality video synthesis with smooth interpolation capabilities.

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network for multi-organ medical image segmentation that uses Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) to capture long-range dependencies efficiently, Parallel Hierarchical Feature Aggregation (PHFA) to aggregate multi-scale features, and Reduced Transformer (RT) to enhance local detail extraction while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information in multi-organ medical image segmentation, while still capturing long-range dependencies effectively.

Method: Proposes LamFormer with three key components: 1) Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in pyramid encoder for multi-scale long-range dependencies, 2) Parallel Hierarchical Feature Aggregation (PHFA) to aggregate features from different encoder layers and filter information, 3) Reduced Transformer (RT) using distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features.

Result: Outperforms existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets, demonstrating exceptional performance while achieving a balance between model performance and model complexity.

Conclusion: LamFormer successfully addresses computational efficiency and local detail extraction challenges in multi-organ medical image segmentation, providing superior performance across diverse datasets while maintaining manageable model complexity.

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

### [437] [DRIFT: Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations for Robust Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24359)
*Amira Guesmi,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRIFT is a stochastic ensemble defense that disrupts gradient consensus to prevent adversarial transferability, achieving strong robustness with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and most defenses fail when gradients can be reliably estimated. The key issue is gradient consensus - where randomized transformations yield aligned gradients that attackers exploit for transferable attacks.

Method: DRIFT uses a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus through gradient dissonance. It combines prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness in a consensus-divergence training strategy.

Result: DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks.

Conclusion: DRIFT establishes gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial defense, delivering robust protection with negligible runtime and memory cost.

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to
yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability.
Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain
effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent
Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight,
learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior
randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces
\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and
logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions
are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical
analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a
consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency,
Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and
(iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet
across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art
preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under
adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers
these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing
gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial
defense.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI-UG is a unified MLLM that combines UI understanding and generation capabilities, achieving SOTA performance on understanding tasks and competitive generation quality with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face challenges in domain-specific UI tasks, particularly in understanding accuracy and generation quality for complex modern UIs.

Method: Uses SFT with GRPO for fine-grained UI understanding, DPO for human-preferred UI generation, and proposes an industrial workflow with LLM-friendly DSL, training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Achieves SOTA on UI understanding tasks, outperforming larger general-purpose MLLMs and similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Matches larger MLLMs in UI generation at fraction of computational cost. Integration of both tasks improves accuracy and quality.

Conclusion: UI-UG successfully integrates UI understanding and generation, demonstrating that unified approach improves both capabilities while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

### [439] [Uni-X: Mitigating Modality Conflict with a Two-End-Separated Architecture for Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24365)
*Jitai Hao,Hao Liu,Xinyan Xiao,Qiang Huang,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-X is a novel X-shaped architecture for unified multimodal models that separates modality-specific processing in shallow and deep layers while sharing middle layers for semantic fusion, eliminating gradient conflicts and achieving superior efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard autoregressive transformers for multimodal learning suffer from severe gradient conflicts between vision and text modalities due to their fundamentally different low-level statistical properties, particularly in shallow and deep layers.

Method: Proposed Uni-X architecture with two-end-separated, middle-shared design: initial and final layers are modality-specific for processing, while middle layers maintain shared parameters for high-level semantic fusion.

Result: Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency and, when scaled to 3B parameters, matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs with GenEval score of 82 for image generation and strong performance in text/vision understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Uni-X establishes a parameter-efficient and scalable foundation for unified multimodal modeling by effectively eliminating gradient conflicts through its X-shaped architecture design.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

### [440] [Real-Aware Residual Model Merging for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24367)
*Jinhee Park,Guisik Kim,Choongsang Cho,Junseok Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R²M is a training-free model merging framework for deepfake detection that combines multiple specialist models by decomposing them into shared Real components and Fake residuals, enabling composable detection without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake generators evolve rapidly, making exhaustive data collection and repeated retraining impractical. Model merging is suitable for deepfake detection since specialists share the same binary decision and differ only in generator-specific artifacts.

Method: Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R²M) estimates a shared Real component via low-rank factorization, decomposes specialists into Real-aligned parts and Fake residuals, denoises residuals with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching.

Result: R²M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset scenarios. It also enables composability - new forgery families can be added by fine-tuning one specialist and re-merging.

Conclusion: R²M provides an effective training-free framework for deepfake detection that preserves Real representations while handling Fake-specific artifacts, and offers composability to adapt to new forgery methods without full retraining.

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining diffusion models and conditional GANs to generate geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery, achieving competitive performance on the CVUSA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Street view imagery is valuable for urban analytics, but synthesizing street-view images from satellite imagery is challenging due to appearance and perspective differences between domains.

Method: Multi-stage training strategy using Stable Diffusion as core component in dual-branch architecture, integrated with conditional GAN for panoramic views, plus fusion strategy to leverage both models' strengths.

Result: Outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple metrics and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based methods on CVUSA dataset.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details like street markings, roads, and atmospheric elements.

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as

TL;DR: DINOReg is a point cloud registration network that effectively fuses visual features from DINOv2 with geometric features at patch level, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RGB-D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud registration methods rely mainly on geometric information and don't fully exploit rich texture and semantic information from images. Current multi-modal approaches use image-lossy feature fusion, limiting their performance.

Method: Uses DINOv2 to extract visual features from images and fuses them with geometric features at patch level. Proposes mixed positional embedding to encode positional information from both image and point cloud spaces.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets, with 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and 15.7% increase in registration recall.

Conclusion: The proposed DINOReg effectively combines visual and geometric information through patch-level fusion and mixed positional embedding, demonstrating superior performance in point cloud registration tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCAE is a mask clustering-based annotation engine that enables efficient large-scale annotation of submeter resolution imagery by treating semantically consistent mask groups as minimal annotating units, achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude efficiency improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Submeter resolution imagery offers fine-grained land cover analysis but lacks sufficient high-quality annotated datasets due to unreliable existing labels and prohibitive manual annotation costs given the rich visual detail and massive data volumes.

Method: Proposed Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE) that leverages spatial autocorrelation principle - objects of same class tend to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods - treating semantically consistent mask groups as minimal annotating units for simultaneous multi-instance annotation.

Result: Built HiCity-LC dataset with ~14 billion labeled pixels, enabling city-scale land cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies above 85%. Achieved 1-2 orders of magnitude annotation efficiency improvement while preserving label quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness.

Conclusion: MCAE demonstrates scalability and practical utility for large-scale submeter resolution mapping, producing the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level land cover benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REALIGN introduces a self-supervised framework using Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport for procedure learning from videos, handling background segments, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders better than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world instructional videos contain background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order, violating the monotonicity assumptions of existing alignment methods. Prior approaches like OPEL rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture higher-order temporal structure.

Method: Uses Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT) to jointly model visual correspondences and temporal relations under partial alignment, integrated with inter-sequence contrastive learning for training stability.

Result: Achieves up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains across egocentric (EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, producing more interpretable transport maps.

Conclusion: REALIGN effectively handles the challenges in procedural video learning by jointly modeling visual and temporal relationships, outperforming previous methods while providing better interpretability.

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

*Haijier Chen,Bo Xu,Shoujian Zhang,Haoze Liu,Jiaxuan Lin,Jingrong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-LLM is a video-based 3D Multimodal Large Language Model that processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, using geometric priors and a Cross-Task Adapter to align 3D geometry with vision-language representations for improved 3D scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D-MLLMs depend on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. The goal is to extend multimodal reasoning capabilities to 3D scene understanding without requiring external 3D data.

Method: Uses video inputs directly, integrates geometric priors through Cross-Task Adapter (CTA), employs Metric Depth Model for real-scale geometry recovery, and fine-tunes with two-stage distillation optimization for fast convergence and stable training.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning, and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating superior multi-task capabilities.

Conclusion: Vid-LLM provides a practical solution for 3D scene understanding without external 3D data, achieving strong performance across multiple 3D reasoning tasks through effective geometric prior integration and optimization strategies.

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

*Junyi Gu,Beatriz Cabrero-Daniel,Ali Nouri,Lydia Armini,Christian Berger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCICF is a framework for systematically identifying and classifying vulnerable road user situations to support operational design domain incident analysis for robotaxis, using space-filling curves to transform multi-dimensional scenario features into patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotaxis need reliable VRU detection in urban areas, and end-to-end AI systems require high-quality data for training and evaluation within their operational design domains.

Method: Extended SMIRK dataset to MoreSMIRK with multi-pedestrian crossing situations, used space-filling curves to transform scenario features into patterns, and matched with MoreSMIRK dictionary entries.

Result: Successfully identified and classified complex pedestrian crossings including group merging/splitting in PIE dataset with 150+ annotated videos, showing potential for onboard ODD detection.

Conclusion: PCICF provides an effective framework for VRU situation analysis that can support robotaxi safety systems and has computational efficiency suitable for onboard deployment.

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

Result: Outperforms existing methods in consistency and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: RapidMV enables fast and consistent multi-view image generation from text, serving as an efficient bridge to 3D asset creation.

Abstract: Generating synthetic multi-view images from a text prompt is an essential
bridge to generating synthetic 3D assets. In this work, we introduce RapidMV, a
novel text-to-multi-view generative model that can produce 32 multi-view
synthetic images in just around 5 seconds. In essence, we propose a novel
spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular
viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and
multi-view consistency. We achieve effective training of RapidMV by
strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We
demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency
and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

### [448] [CLQ: Cross-Layer Guided Orthogonal-based Quantization for Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24416)
*Kai Liu,Shaoqiu Zhang,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLQ is a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization method for diffusion transformers that achieves 4-bit quantization (W4A4) with negligible performance degradation, providing 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) face practical deployment challenges on edge devices due to large model size and complexity, while existing post-training quantization methods suffer from performance degradation.

Method: Three key designs: cross-block calibration for accurate data distribution, orthogonal-based smoothing to handle outliers using block Hadamard matrix, and cross-layer parameter searching.

Result: Successfully compresses DiTs to W4A4 format with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics, achieving 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup for both image and video generation models.

Conclusion: CLQ provides an effective quantization solution for diffusion transformers that maintains performance while significantly reducing memory and computational requirements, enabling practical deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our
code is available at

*Pei-Han Chen,Szu-Chi Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops an automated pipeline for assessing image dataset quality using CleanVision and Fastdup tools, with enhancements including automatic threshold selection. The study shows that different quality issues have varying impacts on model performance, with CNNs being particularly vulnerable to blurring and severe downscaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As model architectures mature and gains from architectural refinements diminish, data quality has become a critical factor in machine learning. However, systematic studies on evaluating dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.

Method: The study uses the CIFAKE dataset to identify common quality issues and quantify their impact. It develops a pipeline integrating CleanVision and Fastdup tools with enhancements including automatic threshold selection for detecting problematic images without manual tuning.

Result: The automatic thresholding method improved F1 scores from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For near-duplicate detection, deduplication strategy increased F1 score from 0.4576 to 0.7928. CNNs showed resilience to certain distortions but vulnerability to blurring and severe downscaling.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow effectively improves data quality assessment in image-based machine learning, demonstrating that not all quality issues have the same impact on model performance and providing a foundation for advancing dataset quality evaluation.

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

*Yuanyuan Gao,Yuning Gong,Yifei Liu,Li Jingfeng,Zhihang Zhong,Dingwen Zhang,Yanci Zhang,Dan Xu,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proxy-GS introduces a proxy system for 3D Gaussian Splatting that provides occlusion awareness, enabling faster rendering and higher quality by culling occluded Gaussians and guiding densification during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods suffer from significant redundancy due to lack of occlusion awareness, leading to unnecessary computation and suboptimal rendering quality in occluded regions.

Method: Uses a fast proxy system that generates precise occlusion depth maps in under 1ms to guide culling of anchors/Gaussians and densification towards surfaces during training.

Result: Achieves 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS while delivering substantially higher rendering quality, especially in heavily occluded scenarios like MatrixCity Streets dataset.

Conclusion: Proxy-GS successfully addresses occlusion redundancy in 3DGS, enabling both faster rendering and improved visual fidelity through occlusion-aware optimization.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

*Runmin Zhang,Jialiang Wang,Si-Yuan Cao,Zhu Yu,Junchen Yu,Guangyi Zhang,Hui-Liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFlow is an unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation framework that uses decoupled optimization and cross-modal consistency constraints to address modality discrepancies and geometric misalignment without ground-truth flow supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches implicitly learn flow estimation from appearance similarity alone, which fails to adequately address modality discrepancy and geometric misalignment between different modalities.

Method: Uses a decoupled optimization strategy with collaborative training of modality transfer and flow estimation networks, geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline with outlier-robust loss, and cross-modal consistency constraint for joint optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches and can be integrated with various flow estimation networks, as demonstrated on a comprehensive cross-modal flow benchmark.

Conclusion: DCFlow effectively addresses cross-modal flow estimation challenges through its novel decoupled optimization and consistency constraints, enabling reliable unsupervised learning without ground-truth flow data.

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI2V-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Image-to-Video (I2V) generation models, focusing on semantic understanding and reasoning abilities rather than just video quality and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V evaluation benchmarks overlook models' ability to understand specific subject semantics in input images and ensure generated videos align with physical laws and human commonsense.

Method: Proposes UI2V-Bench with four evaluation dimensions (spatial understanding, attribute binding, category understanding, reasoning) and two MLLM-based evaluation methods: instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding and feedback-based reasoning pipeline for step-by-step causal assessment.

Result: Benchmark includes ~500 text-image pairs and evaluates various open-source and closed-source I2V models. Human evaluations show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based metrics.

Conclusion: UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, providing a robust framework and dataset for future research and model development.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

### [453] [Beyond Isolated Facts: Synthesizing Narrative and Grounded Supervision for VideoQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24445)
*Jianxin Liang,Tan Yue,Yuxuan Wang,Yueqian Wang,Zhihan Yin,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals for VideoQA by generating narrative paragraphs and visual rationales from existing question-answer pairs, achieving state-of-the-art results and improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA models are constrained by isolated factual question-answer pairs that fail to capture narrative and causal structure, limiting models to shallow understanding of video content.

Method: Proposes two strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP) synthesizes diverse inquiries into holistic narrative paragraphs, and Question-Based Captioning (QBC) generates fine-grained visual rationales grounding answers in specific evidence. Uses generative models to create synthetic data for training under unified next-token prediction.

Result: Achieves significant accuracy gains: 72.5% on STAR (+4.9%) with 3B model and 80.8% on NExT-QA with 7B model. Both QBP and QBC enhance cross-dataset generalization, with QBP accelerating model convergence by over 2.5x.

Conclusion: Shifting data synthesis from isolated facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields more accurate, efficient, and generalizable VideoQA training paradigm.

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

TL;DR: NeoWorld is a deep learning framework that generates interactive 3D virtual worlds from single images using a hybrid approach with object-centric 3D representations for foreground objects and 2D synthesis for backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by on-demand worldbuilding from Simulacron-3, to create expansive virtual environments where only actively explored regions are rendered with high visual realism, addressing limitations of global world generation and 2D hallucination methods.

Method: Uses hybrid scene structure with object-centric 3D representations for key foreground objects and 2D synthesis for backgrounds/non-interacted regions, implemented with representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enabling viewpoint manipulation and natural language control.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore benchmark, delivering dynamic, immersive exploration with progressive 3D detail as users interact.

Conclusion: NeoWorld enables flexible, physically plausible virtual world generation from single images, providing visually coherent interactive experiences through its efficient hybrid 3D/2D approach.

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

*Shijie Lian,Changti Wu,Laurence Tianruo Yang,Hang Yuan,Bin Yu,Lei Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows that fine-tuning multimodal LLMs on Euclidean geometry problems (Euclid30K dataset) significantly improves their spatial reasoning abilities across multiple benchmarks without task-specific adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial intelligence remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models, despite being essential for abilities like visualizing shapes, mental rotation, and relational reasoning.

Method: Created Euclid30K dataset with 30K plane and solid geometry problems, then used Group Relative Policy Optimization to finetune Qwen2.5VL and RoboBrain2.0 models on Euclidean principles.

Result: Models achieved substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks. Mean VSI-Bench accuracy rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, with RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieving 49.6% accuracy, surpassing previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: This is the first systematic study demonstrating that geometry-centric fine-tuning can provide vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and
Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

*Hangil Park,Yongmin Seo,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-model ensemble approach using knowledge distillation for general anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance across both industrial and semantic anomaly detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods are biased towards industrial inspection and struggle with generalization across different anomaly types (patch-level vs semantic). There's a need for a unified approach that works well in both domains.

Method: Proposes a dual-model ensemble with teacher-student knowledge distillation: one Encoder-Decoder model for industrial patch-level defects and one Encoder-Encoder model for semantic anomalies, both using shared DINOv2 encoder. Uses Noisy-OR objective and joint probability scoring.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across 8 benchmarks: 99.7% AUROC on MVTec-AD (industrial) and 97.8% on CIFAR-10 (semantic), outperforming both specialist and general models in multi-class and single-class settings.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-model ensemble effectively bridges the gap between industrial and semantic anomaly detection, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple domains and achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

*Heechang Kim,Gwanghyun Kim,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a zero-shot method to generate diverse and expressive human motions by integrating Laban movement analysis (Effort and Shape components) into text-guided diffusion models, enabling fine-grained motion control without additional training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving fine-grained expressive motion control in text-to-motion synthesis is challenging due to limited motion style diversity in datasets and difficulty expressing quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis provides a systematic way to describe motion qualities.

Method: A zero-shot, inference-time optimization method that updates text embeddings of pretrained diffusion models during sampling to guide motion generation toward desired Laban Effort and Shape components, without requiring additional motion data.

Result: The approach successfully generates diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving motion identity, effectively manipulating motion attributes according to target Laban tags.

Conclusion: The integration of Laban movement analysis quantification methods enables interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation, addressing limitations of existing text-to-motion synthesis approaches.

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

*Julio Hurtado,Haoran Ni,Duygu Sap,Connor Mattinson,Martin Lotz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A selective representation framework for second-hand fashion image retrieval that reduces database size by 90% while maintaining accuracy through clustering, coreset selection, and outlier removal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fashion industry's environmental impact drives need for efficient second-hand marketplaces, requiring scalable image retrieval systems for large-scale garment valuation.

Method: Uses clustering and coreset selection to identify representative samples, plus neighbor-homogeneity consistency scoring for outlier removal before selection.

Result: Achieves 10x database size reduction without accuracy loss, with outlier removal further improving retrieval performance on DeepFashion datasets.

Conclusion: Strategic pruning and representative selection enables efficient second-hand fashion retrieval, balancing performance and computational costs.

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

*Yuanshuai Li,Yuping Yan,Junfeng Tang,Yunxuan Li,Zeqi Zheng,Yaochu Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCPO is a novel framework that uses semantic curriculum learning to reduce visual hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models, achieving up to 62.9% reduction in hallucination rates while maintaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from visual hallucinations where responses contradict visual evidence, and existing alignment methods like DPO fail to capture fine-grained semantic differences and encourage shortcut learning.

Method: Proposes Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO) with progressive easy-to-hard curriculum using Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, dynamic reference model, and symmetric bidirectional objective for simultaneous learning from textual and visual preferences.

Result: Extensive experiments on LLaVA models show superior performance on hallucination benchmarks with up to 62.9% reduction in hallucination rate, while improving factuality and preserving general capabilities on vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics, symmetry, and curriculum for MLLM alignment, effectively mitigating visual hallucinations while maintaining model performance across various tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

*Jiaqi Tan,Xu Zheng,Fangyu Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EQUISeg is a multimodal segmentation framework that addresses modality imbalance through equal encoding and a self-guided module with mutual guidance mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal segmentation methods suffer from imbalanced modal dependencies, where performance degrades significantly when a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes EQUISeg with four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block for efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection, plus a Self-guided Module with mutual guidance mechanism to adaptively adjust modality contributions.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show EQUISeg achieves significant performance gains and effectively alleviates adverse effects of modality imbalance.

Conclusion: EQUISeg successfully balances modality contributions and enhances robustness in multimodal segmentation tasks under degraded conditions.

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

*Jiaqi Tan,Fangyu Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QL-Adapter is a framework for multiple object editing that addresses challenges in enforcing object counts, spatial layouts, and handling diverse categories through two core modules: Image-Layout Fusion Module and Cross-Modal Augmentation Module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CLIP text encoders often fail in complex scenes with many objects during instruction-driven image editing, particularly in maintaining object counts and spatial layouts across diverse categories.

Method: QL-Adapter uses ILFM to fuse layout priors with ViT patch tokens from CLIP image encoder for spatial structure understanding, and CMAM injects image features into text branch to enrich textual embeddings. Also created QL-Dataset benchmark for quantity and layout consistent editing.

Result: Extensive experiments show QL-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on QL-Edit task and significantly outperforms existing models.

Conclusion: QL-Adapter effectively solves the challenges of multiple object editing by combining layout fusion and cross-modal augmentation, demonstrating superior performance in quantity and layout consistent image editing.

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

### [463] [CMT: Mid-Training for Efficient Learning of Consistency, Mean Flow, and Flow Map Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24526)
*Zheyuan Hu,Chieh-Hsin Lai,Yuki Mitsufuji,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Consistency Mid-Training (CMT), a lightweight intermediate training stage between diffusion pre-training and flow map training that enables stable, efficient few-step generation with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow map models (CM, MF) suffer from unstable training, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and high computational costs. Initializing from pre-trained diffusion models helps but doesn't resolve the instability of converting infinitesimal steps to long-jump maps.

Method: CMT trains a model to map points along a solver trajectory from a pre-trained diffusion model directly to the solver-generated clean sample, creating a trajectory-consistent and stable initialization for subsequent flow map training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10, 1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, using up to 98% less training data and GPU time compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, reaches 1-step FID 3.34 with 50% less training time than MF.

Conclusion: CMT establishes a principled, efficient, and general framework for training flow map models, enabling fast and robust convergence without heuristics while significantly reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMRQA is a novel MRI quality assessment framework that integrates multimodal large language models with acquisition-aware signal processing to bridge quantitative metrics and semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MRI quality assessment faces trade-offs between quantitative signal-based methods (lacking semantic understanding) and deep learning approaches (sacrificing interpretability), creating challenges for clinical decision-making.

Method: Combines three innovations: robust metric extraction with simulated artifacts using MRQy, structured transformation of metrics into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through LoRA adaptation of LLaVA-OneVision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MR-ART, FastMRI, and MyConnectome benchmarks with strong zero-shot generalization, validated by comprehensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, generating clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality control in dynamic medical settings.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves 3D semantic mapping by using SemanticSAM for better object-level masks and context-aware CLIP encoding for richer semantic context, achieving superior performance in 3D scene understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot 3D semantic mapping methods produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to direct use of raw masks from vision-language models, limiting effectiveness in complex environments.

Method: Leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement for more accurate object-level masks, and employ context-aware CLIP encoding with multiple contextual views using empirical weighting for richer semantic context.

Result: Experimental evaluation on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks shows significant improvements over existing methods in 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses fragmentation and semantic inaccuracy issues in zero-shot 3D semantic mapping, demonstrating superior performance through improved mask generation and enhanced semantic context integration.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a unified theoretical and experimental comparison between Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching, showing that Diffusion Bridge has lower cost function and more stable trajectories, while Flow Matching becomes less effective with smaller training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is confusion about which approach (Diffusion Bridge vs Flow Matching) is generally preferable, and substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions have hindered unified theoretical understanding of their relative merits.

Method: Recast both frameworks through Stochastic Optimal Control and Optimal Transport perspectives, propose a novel Diffusion Bridge architecture with latent Transformer, and implement Flow Matching with same structure for fair comparison across multiple tasks with varying distributional discrepancy and training data size.

Result: Extensive experiments across Image Inpainting, Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer show Diffusion Bridge has lower cost function and more stable trajectories, while Flow Matching interpolation coefficients become ineffective with reduced training data.

Conclusion: Theoretical predictions are confirmed: Diffusion Bridge is generally preferable due to lower cost function and more stable trajectories, while Flow Matching's effectiveness diminishes with smaller training data.

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion
Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with
the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various
experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting,
Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks,
systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different
difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align
perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the
respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a crowd counting method for foggy environments using atmospheric scattering physics and deep learning, achieving significant accuracy improvements in dense fog scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address key challenges in crowd counting under foggy conditions: long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast attenuation caused by atmospheric scattering.

Method: 1) Differentiable atmospheric scattering model with transmittance dynamic estimation and scattering parameter calibration; 2) MSA-KAN architecture based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem for enhanced nonlinear representation; 3) Weather-aware GCN with dynamic spatial adjacency matrices.

Result: Achieves 12.2%-27.5% reduction in MAE metrics compared to mainstream algorithms on four public datasets in dense fog scenarios.

Conclusion: The synergistic optimization of physical mechanisms and data-driven approaches effectively improves crowd counting accuracy under complex meteorological conditions.

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

### [468] [TokenSwap: Backdoor Attack on the Compositional Understanding of Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24566)
*Zhifang Zhang,Qiqi Tao,Jiaqi Lv,Na Zhao,Lei Feng,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSwap is a stealthy backdoor attack on large vision-language models that subtly disrupts object relationship understanding rather than forcing fixed target patterns, making it harder to detect than traditional backdoor attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs use fixed target patterns that are easily detectable due to model overconfidence on these patterns. The authors aim to create a more evasive attack that focuses on disrupting compositional understanding.

Method: TokenSwap injects visual triggers into training samples while swapping grammatical roles of key tokens in textual answers. It uses an adaptive token-weighted loss to emphasize learning of swapped tokens, associating visual triggers with bags-of-words behavior.

Result: Extensive experiments show TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM architectures.

Conclusion: TokenSwap demonstrates that backdoor attacks can be made more stealthy by targeting compositional understanding rather than using fixed patterns, highlighting the vulnerability of LVLMs to subtle relationship disruption attacks.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE is a diffusion-based category-level object pose estimation model that uses DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors to eliminate the need for discrete category labels, enabling generalization to unknown objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need accurate object pose estimation in open environments with unknown objects, requiring semantic understanding to generalize beyond known categories.

Method: Combines DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise model for point normals, using cross-attention to inject continuous semantic priors for learning canonicalized object coordinate systems.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in synthetically trained category-level object pose estimation with 31.9% relative improvement on 5°5cm metric, and achieves up to 100% success rate in grasping unseen objects from unknown categories.

Conclusion: SCOPE effectively bridges the Sim2Real gap and enables generalization beyond known object categories through continuous semantic priors, making it suitable for real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull Morphable Model (BFSM) that enables shape inference between faces and skulls through a shared coefficient space, addressing challenges in joint face-skull modeling for medical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in joint face-skull modeling including scarce paired data, registration accuracy issues, limited clinical applications, and underrepresentation of craniofacial deformities.

Method: Constructed a dataset with 200+ samples including normal and craniofacial deformity cases, developed a dense ray matching registration method for topological consistency, and created a bidirectional morphable model with shared coefficient space and tissue thickness variation modeling.

Result: The BFSM model enables accurate bidirectional shape inference between faces and skulls, supports one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull, and demonstrates potential in medical applications like 3D reconstruction from single images and surgical planning.

Conclusion: The proposed BFSM method provides a robust and accurate solution for joint face-skull modeling, addressing previous limitations and showing strong potential for various medical applications including diagnostics and surgical planning.

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of YOLOv11 variants for peripheral blood smear analysis shows YOLOv11 Medium achieves best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, with mAP@0.5 of 0.934.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual peripheral blood smear analysis is labor intensive and subjective, while existing deep learning approaches lack systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models like YOLOv11 for fine-grained blood cell detection.

Method: Curated large-scale annotated dataset (16,891 images, 298,850 cells across 12 PBC classes plus RBC class) and conducted comprehensive evaluation of five YOLOv11 variants (Nano to XLarge) under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) using multiple performance metrics.

Result: YOLOv11 Medium achieves best trade-off with mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under 80:10:10 split. Larger models provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially higher computational cost. 80:10:10 split consistently outperforms 70:20:10 split across all models.

Conclusion: YOLOv11, particularly the Medium variant, is highly effective for automated fine-grained PBS detection. The publicly released dataset provides valuable resource for advancing blood cell detection research in hematology.

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

*Bikash Kumar Badatya,Vipul Baghel,Jyotirmoy Amin,Ravi Hegde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel unsupervised framework for javelin-throw motion segmentation using structured optimal transport with ASTGCN, achieving superior performance without manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sports analytics methods are manual, costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of kinetic variables requires robust temporal segmentation for precise motion analysis.

Method: Unsupervised framework combining structured optimal transport (SOT) with Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) for contextually aware motion phase segmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods with 71.02% mAP and 74.61% F1-score on test data. Released dataset of 211 annotated professional javelin-throw videos.

Conclusion: The approach enables automatic identification of motion phase transitions without expensive manual labeling, providing scalable solution for sports analytics.

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeRet is a plug-and-play framework that converts any multimodal large language model (MLLM) into a two-stage retriever without additional training, using semantic embeddings for candidate search and reasoning for reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs require heavy post-hoc training to become contrastive encoders for retrieval, creating a gap in their use as general-purpose models. The goal is to enable off-the-shelf MLLMs to serve as powerful retrievers without additional training.

Method: FreeRet uses a two-stage approach: 1) derives semantically grounded embeddings directly from MLLMs for fast candidate search, bypassing lexical alignment layers; 2) exploits MLLM reasoning ability for precise reranking, using explicit priors and neutral choice framing to mitigate framing effects.

Result: On MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. It scales across MLLM families and sizes, preserves generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation in end-to-end RAG.

Conclusion: Pretrained MLLMs, when carefully harnessed through FreeRet, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a critical gap in their role as generalists and enabling plug-and-play multimodal retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPLICE is a human-curated benchmark from COIN dataset for evaluating event-based reasoning across temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and knowledge dimensions. It shows VLMs significantly underperform humans in event sequencing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe visual reasoning capabilities across multiple dimensions and assess the gap between human and model performance in event-based reasoning tasks.

Method: Created SPLICE benchmark with 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories, segmented into 11,423 event clips. Evaluated humans and VLMs on rearranging clips into coherent sequences, with and without textual descriptions.

Result: Significant performance gap between humans and VLMs. Human-annotated descriptions improve model accuracy but not human performance. VLMs perform better on temporal/causal reasoning tasks and everyday activities than on contextual/spatial reasoning and specialized tasks.

Conclusion: VLMs rely more on language priors than visual understanding, and current models fall short of human-level reasoning, highlighting persistent challenges in visual reasoning.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

### [475] [RIFLE: Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24644)
*Zhu,Libo,Zhou,Zihan,Liu,Xiaoyang,Zhang,Weihang,Shi,Keyu,Fu,Yifan,Zhang,Yulun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIFLE is a diffusion-based framework that removes flicker-banding artifacts from photos of emissive displays by predicting banding attributes and using masked loss for targeted restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flicker-banding artifacts frequently degrade photos of screens due to temporal aliasing between camera rolling-shutter and display modulation, but this problem remains underexplored compared to moire artifacts.

Method: Proposes RIFLE framework with flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) to predict banding attributes, masked loss for focused supervision, and a simulation pipeline to generate realistic training data with stochastic jitter and feathered boundaries.

Result: RIFLE outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines across quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on real-world dataset, handling mild to severe flicker-banding while preserving fine details.

Conclusion: This is the first work to systematically research flicker-banding simulation and removal, establishing foundations for future research in dataset construction and removal model design.

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

*Adil Kaan Akan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SlotAdapt, a framework that adapts pretrained diffusion models for object-centric synthesis in images and videos, enabling fine-grained control over individual objects while maintaining scene coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. There's a need to represent scenes as compositions of discrete objects for controllable generation.

Method: Integrates lightweight slot-based conditioning into pretrained diffusion models. For images: uses register token for background/style and slot-conditioned modules for objects. For videos: uses Invariant Slot Attention (ISA) to separate object identity from pose and Transformer-based temporal aggregator.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art in object discovery, segmentation, compositional editing, and controllable image generation. Also sets new benchmarks in unsupervised video object segmentation and reconstruction, supporting object removal, replacement, and insertion.

Conclusion: Establishes a general and scalable approach to object-centric generative modeling that bridges human object-based perception with machine learning, expanding possibilities for interactive and structured generative tools.

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

*Junyi Zhang,Jia-Chen Gu,Wenbo Hu,Yu Zhou,Robinson Piramuthu,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TemMed-Bench is the first benchmark for analyzing patient condition changes across clinical visits using temporal medical images, revealing LVLMs' limitations in temporal reasoning and showing multi-modal retrieval augmentation improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks focus on single-visit analysis, which deviates from real clinical practice where doctors track patient changes over time using historical data.

Method: Created TemMed-Bench with three tasks (VQA, report generation, image-pair selection) and 17K+ knowledge corpus; evaluated 12 LVLMs; explored multi-modal retrieval augmentation combining visual and textual modalities.

Result: Most LVLMs lack temporal reasoning ability, performing at random-guessing level in closed-book settings. GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed decent performance but not ideal. Multi-modal retrieval improved VQA by average 2.59%.

Conclusion: LVLMs have significant limitations in temporal medical image reasoning; multi-modal retrieval augmentation shows promise for addressing this challenge in real-world clinical practice.

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

Conclusion: The hybrid VNODE approach successfully captures complex patterns in image classification tasks with greater efficiency than conventional deep architectures, demonstrating the value of combining discrete and continuous processing methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces Volterra Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
(VNODE), a piecewise continuous Volterra Neural Network that integrates
nonlinear Volterra filtering with continuous time neural ordinary differential
equations for image classification. Drawing inspiration from the visual cortex,
where discrete event processing is interleaved with continuous integration,
VNODE alternates between discrete Volterra feature extraction and ODE driven

TL;DR: GSM8K-V is a new visual mathematical reasoning benchmark created by converting text-based GSM8K problems into visual format, revealing significant performance gaps between text and visual reasoning in current vision language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks are limited to geometry, lack math word problems, and rarely assess multi-image reasoning. There's a need for comprehensive benchmarks that evaluate VLMs' ability to understand and reason about mathematical information presented visually.

Method: Systematically mapped GSM8K text samples into visual form using automated image-generation pipeline combined with human annotation, creating 1,319 high-quality visual samples. Evaluated various open-source and closed-source models on this benchmark.

Result: Major performance gap found: best model (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves 95.22% on text GSM8K but only 46.93% on GSM8K-V, showing substantial room for improvement in visual mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: GSM8K-V provides a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and establishes a benchmark to guide development of more robust and generalizable vision language models.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

TL;DR: A classifier-centric adaptive framework with lightweight text adapter and layered asymmetric initialization improves open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation by enhancing classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires high generalization for unseen categories, and existing methods show classification components significantly impact segmentation performance.

Method: Proposed a classifier-centric adaptive framework with lightweight text adapter using novel layered asymmetric initialization to enhance classification capabilities.

Result: Achieved substantial improvements over OVCoser baseline on OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increased from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658, and cMAE reduced from 0.336 to 0.239.

Conclusion: Targeted classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing camouflaged object segmentation performance in open-vocabulary settings.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing

TL;DR: Development of an automated segmentation pipeline for traumatic brain injury (TBI) lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans using nnUNet framework with post-processing, achieving competitive results in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBI lesions are extremely heterogeneous in size, number, and laterality, complicating image registration and brain parcellation, which reduces analytical accuracy. Accurate segmentation is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis.

Method: Leveraged various architectures within the nnUNet framework for initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance evaluation metrics.

Result: Achieved accuracy of 0.8451, Dice scores of 0.4711 (images with visible lesions) and 0.8514 (images without visible lesions), with overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking among top-6 methods in AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge.

Conclusion: The developed automated segmentation pipeline effectively addresses the challenge of TBI lesion segmentation, with publicly available Python implementation for broader use.

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without
visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking
among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python
implementation of our pipeline is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SANA-Video is an efficient diffusion model for generating high-resolution, minute-long videos with fast inference speed and low training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a video generation model that can produce high-quality, long videos efficiently with minimal computational resources and deployment costs.

Method: Uses Linear DiT with linear attention for efficiency and constant-memory KV cache for block linear attention to enable long video generation with global context.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models while being 16x faster in latency, deployable on RTX 5090 GPUs with 2.4x speedup for 5-second 720p videos.

Conclusion: SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation with efficient training and deployment capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

TL;DR: A training-free framework that improves physical plausibility in video generation by using physics-aware reasoning and synchronized decoupled guidance to suppress implausible motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for video generation implicitly learn physics from large datasets, which is costly, difficult to scale, and still produces physically implausible motions that violate fundamental laws.

Method: Uses a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to create counterfactual prompts encoding physics-violating behaviors, and proposes Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) with synchronized directional normalization and trajectory-decoupled denoising to suppress implausible content.

Result: Experiments across different physical domains show substantial enhancement in physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism, with no additional training required. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both components.

Conclusion: Establishes a new plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation that explicitly reasons about physical plausibility at inference time.

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IWR-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Large Vision-Language Models on interactive webpage reconstruction from video, addressing limitations of static screenshot-to-code tasks by incorporating dynamic interactions from real websites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks but overlook dynamic interactions essential for real-world web applications, creating a gap in evaluating models' ability to handle interactive web elements.

Method: Created IWR-Bench with 113 tasks from 100 real websites, featuring 1,001 actions and diverse interaction complexities. Includes user interaction videos and crawled static assets, evaluated using an agent-as-a-judge framework with metrics for functional correctness and visual fidelity.

Result: Extensive testing of 28 LVLMs shows poor performance - best model achieves only 36.35% overall score, with functional correctness (24.39%) lagging significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25%).

Conclusion: Current models struggle with temporal dynamics reasoning and event-driven logic synthesis. IWR-Bench establishes a challenging frontier for vision-language research and highlights critical limitations in existing approaches.

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is

*Luis F. W. Batista,Tom Bourbon,Cedric Pradalier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Polarimetric imaging helps segment floating debris on water by mitigating surface glare, improving mean IoU and reducing contour errors compared to RGB inputs, though it increases computational load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of floating debris is often compromised by surface glare and changing outdoor illumination, which polarimetric imaging can help mitigate.

Method: Benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks on PoTATO dataset of polarimetric images, comparing with single-image baselines using traditional models.

Result: Polarimetric cues help recover low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs.

Conclusion: Polarized cameras can improve debris segmentation but increase computational load; the benchmark helps researchers decide if polarized cameras suit their applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset with 1.5M+ CT-PET images and 2,757 clinical reports, addressing gaps in PET/CT imaging data and low-resource language representation in medical VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical VLMs lack diverse imaging modalities (especially PET/CT) and focus primarily on high-resource languages, limiting their generalizability and clinical utility, particularly for Vietnamese healthcare.

Method: Created a large-scale Vietnamese multimodal dataset with CT-PET image pairs and clinical reports, plus a training framework with data augmentation and expert-validated test sets for benchmarking VLMs on medical report generation and visual question answering.

Result: Incorporating the dataset significantly improves performance of existing VLMs on downstream tasks, demonstrating enhanced capabilities in handling functional imaging tasks and Vietnamese language processing.

Conclusion: The dataset and benchmark represent a pivotal advancement for developing more robust medical VLMs, particularly for low-resource languages like Vietnamese, improving clinical relevance in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RGBDT500, a novel multi-modal tracking dataset with RGB, Depth, and Thermal Infrared modalities, and proposes RDTTrack, a tri-modal tracker that fuses these complementary modalities using prompt learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal tracking approaches are limited to dual-modal paradigms (RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal) and struggle in complex scenarios due to insufficient input modalities. The authors aim to enhance robustness by incorporating three complementary modalities.

Method: Proposes RDTTrack, which integrates tri-modal information by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning. It fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities under an orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with RGB signals as prompts for the foundation tracking model.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios. The RGBDT500 dataset contains 500 videos with synchronized RGB, depth, and thermal infrared frames with precise bounding box annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed tri-modal tracking approach effectively harmonizes complementary cues from RGB, depth, and thermal infrared modalities, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to dual-modal methods in complex tracking scenarios.

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

*Jiaqi Chen,Xinhao Ji,Yuanyuan Gao,Hao Li,Yuning Gong,Yifei Liu,Dan Xu,Zhihang Zhong,Dingwen Zhang,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExGS is a feed-forward framework for extreme 3D Gaussian Splatting compression that combines Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) for aggressive pruning with GaussPainter for quality restoration using diffusion priors, achieving over 100× compression while preserving rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS compression methods face trade-offs between compression efficiency and rendering quality - optimization-based methods are slow and scene-specific, while training-free methods degrade quality at high compression ratios.

Method: ExGS unifies two components: UGC performs re-optimization-free pruning to reduce Gaussian primitives, and GaussPainter uses diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore quality from heavily pruned scenes, featuring a lightweight VAE and one-step diffusion for real-time operation.

Result: The framework achieves over 100× compression (reducing 354.77 MB models to ~3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and improving image quality under challenging conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of diffusion priors in bridging compression and quality.

Conclusion: Diffusion priors play a central role in enabling extreme compression while maintaining high-quality neural rendering, with ExGS providing a practical solution for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at
\href{https://github.com/chenttt2001/ExGS}{here}.

TL;DR: VTPerception-R1 is a two-stage framework that improves multimodal reasoning by decoupling perception from reasoning, using explicit perception strategies with textual cues to enhance reasoning accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models often fail to properly ground reasoning in perceptual evidence, leading to unreliable outputs. The study aims to address this limitation by systematically evaluating different perception strategies.

Method: A two-stage framework: Stage 1 uses perception-augmented fine-tuning, and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with visual, textual, and consistency rewards. The approach decouples perception from reasoning and emphasizes explicit perception with textual cues.

Result: VTPerception-R1 significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse multimodal tasks, with explicit perception strategies showing the best performance improvements, especially for smaller models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal reasoning, demonstrating that explicit perception strategies are crucial for improving MLLM performance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning
in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception
strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal
benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception,
especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples
perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning,
and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual,
textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1
significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks,
offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal
reasoning. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: SkyLink method for cross-view geo-localization that addresses semantic degradation from viewpoint disparities using data enhancement, patch-aware feature aggregation, and 3D scene information integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches overlook semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities in cross-view geo-localization, leading to poor feature matching between different viewpoints.

Method: Uses Google Retrieval Enhancement Module for street image data enhancement, Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation for local feature consistency, and integrates 3D scene information from UAV images with self-supervised and cross-view contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves 25.75% Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 dataset in UAVM2025 Challenge, demonstrating robustness and generalization across diverse urban scenarios.

Conclusion: SkyLink effectively addresses viewpoint variation challenges in cross-view geo-localization through comprehensive feature enhancement and 3D scene integration.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$
Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 in the UAVM2025 Challenge. Code will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LOVE-R1 addresses long video understanding challenges by introducing adaptive zoom-in mechanism that balances temporal understanding and spatial details through multi-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs with uniform frame sampling sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, leading to suboptimal performance in long video understanding tasks.

Method: Proposes LOVE-R1 with slow-fast adaptive frame sampling: starts with densely sampled small-resolution frames, then adaptively zooms in on clips of interest with higher resolution through multi-step reasoning. Uses 38k CoT data for finetuning and decoupled reinforcement finetuning for process supervision.

Result: Achieves better trade-off between sampling density and frame resolutions. Outperforms baseline Qwen2.5-VL by average 3.1% across 4 long video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: The adaptive zoom-in mechanism effectively addresses the conflict between temporal understanding and spatial perception in long video understanding.

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study reveals that visual functions in MLLMs are localized to specific layers called Vision Function Layers (VFLs), with consistent patterns across models that align with human cognitive processes. The findings enable more efficient training and data selection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how visual processing functions are distributed across decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models and leverage this knowledge for more efficient model training and data selection.

Method: Developed Visual Token Swapping framework to analyze layer-specific functions by modifying KV cache entries. Used this to identify Vision Function Layers (VFLs) and their hierarchical organization.

Result: Found that visual functions like counting, grounding, and OCR are localized to 2-3 specific layers per function, with consistent depth patterns across different MLLMs. VFL-LoRA outperforms full-LoRA training and prevents function forgetting. VFL-select achieves 98% performance with only 20% of data.

Conclusion: The study provides deeper understanding of MLLM visual processing, enabling more efficient, interpretable, and robust models through targeted training and data selection based on identified Vision Function Layers.

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

TL;DR: Causal-Adapter is a modular framework that adapts frozen text-to-image diffusion models for counterfactual image generation by enabling causal interventions on target attributes while preserving image identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, lacking precise control over attribute modifications and proper handling of causal dependencies between attributes.

Method: Leverages structural causal modeling with two attribute regularization strategies: prompt-aligned injection for semantic control and conditioned token contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious correlations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91% MAE reduction on Pendulum dataset for accurate attribute control and 87% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI image generation.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation in generated images.

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TACO-Net is a novel 3D object classification method that combines topological data analysis with image filtration techniques to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and demonstrates strong robustness on real-world and corrupted datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D object classification is crucial for applications in computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving, but remains challenging due to unordered, irregular, and noisy point cloud data.

Method: Transform point clouds into voxelized binary 3D images, extract topological features using topological data analysis and image filtration techniques, and train a lightweight 1D CNN on the extracted features.

Result: Achieved 99.05% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 99.52% on ModelNet10, demonstrating strong performance on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D dataset and resilience to corrupted inputs.

Conclusion: TACO-Net sets a new state-of-the-art for 3D object classification by effectively combining topological features with deep learning, showing superior accuracy and robustness across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP2You is a tuning-free solution for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from unconstrained 2D photos, using a data rectifier paradigm and pose-correlated feature aggregation to efficiently process raw images into clean multi-view inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches require clean inputs with minimal occlusions or well-calibrated cross-view captures, which limits practical applications. UP2You addresses the need to process raw, unstructured photographs that vary in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion.

Method: Introduces a data rectifier paradigm that converts unconstrained inputs into clean orthogonal multi-view images in seconds. Uses pose-correlated feature aggregation (PCFA) to fuse information from multiple reference images and a perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor that eliminates need for pre-captured body templates.

Result: Outperforms previous methods in geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). Efficient (1.5 minutes per person) and versatile for arbitrary pose control and training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on.

Conclusion: UP2You provides a practical solution for real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured, making high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from unconstrained photos feasible without requiring clean inputs or extensive optimization.

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

### [496] [Training-Free Token Pruning via Zeroth-Order Gradient Estimation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24837)
*Youngeun Kim,Youjia Zhang,Huiling Liu,Aecheon Jung,Sunwoo Lee,Sungeun Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free token pruning framework for VLMs that selects tokens based on sensitivity and diversity, achieving up to 94.4% token reduction while maintaining accuracy and 2.30x faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token pruning methods have limitations: attention-based approaches are unstable across layers/heads and select redundant tokens, while diversity-based methods risk dropping important regions needed for accurate predictions.

Method: Proposes a framework that estimates token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at the projection layer, measuring how small random perturbations affect projection outputs to approximate token influence without backpropagation. Selects tokens that are both sensitive and capture complementary visual cues.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method consistently outperforms prior approaches, pruning up to 94.4% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end inference over baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework effectively addresses limitations of existing token pruning methods by combining sensitivity estimation and diversity considerations, significantly improving VLM efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHASE-Net is a physics-informed rPPG model derived from hemodynamic equations, using a lightweight architecture with axial swapping, adaptive spatial filtering, and gated temporal convolutions for robust non-contact heart rate monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) lack theoretical grounding, limiting robustness and interpretability, especially under head motion and illumination changes.

Method: Derived from Navier-Stokes equations, the approach shows pulse signals follow a second-order dynamical system. PHASE-Net implements: (1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper for cross-region feature interaction, (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter for noise suppression, and (3) Gated TCN for long-range temporal modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with strong efficiency, achieving robust rPPG measurement under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: PHASE-Net provides a theoretically grounded, deployment-ready rPPG solution that bridges physics principles with deep learning for improved robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MDD diagnosis relies on subjective scales, and existing EEG deep learning models treat spectra as static images with fixed graphs, limiting accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Proposes ELPG-DTFS with three key components: (1) channel-band attention with cross-band mutual information, (2) learnable adjacency matrix for dynamic functional links, and (3) residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting neuroscience priors.

Result: Achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1 score on the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art ACM-GNN. Ablation studies show removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35.

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS offers a robust and interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics, with complementary value from all three proposed modules.

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)
provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static
images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy
and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive
time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention
with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for
dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting
neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS
achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art
ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35,
confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and
interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.

Motivation: Inspired by human visual system's contrast enhancement and color-opponency mechanisms to improve robustness in semantic segmentation.

Method: Apply Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels as model-agnostic preprocessing step.

Result: Maintains in-distribution performance while improving robustness to night, fog, and snow conditions on Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich datasets.

Conclusion: Lightweight, model-agnostic preprocessing enables imaging systems to deliver robust inputs for safety-critical vision applications.

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limitations in real-time streaming scenarios due to storage constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning.

Method: Proposes StreamForest with Persistent Event Memory Forest that organizes video frames into event-level tree structures using penalty functions, and Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window for detailed short-term visual cues. Also introduces OnlineIT instruction-tuning dataset.

Result: Achieves 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. Maintains 96.8% accuracy under extreme visual token compression (1024 tokens).

Conclusion: StreamForest demonstrates robustness, efficiency, and generalizability for streaming video understanding, particularly in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

*Nikos Kostagiolas,Pantelis Georgiades,Yannis Panagakis,Mihalis A. Nicolaou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel diffusion model for satellite image generation that conditions on environmental context using text, metadata, and visual data, addressing limitations of missing data and improving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for remote sensing have limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle with missing/corrupted data, and fail to reliably reflect user intentions in generated outputs.

Method: Proposes a diffusion model conditioned on environmental context using three control signals: text, metadata, and visual data. Incorporates metadata fusion strategy to handle partially corrupt/missing observations and models attribute embedding interactions.

Result: Outperforms previous methods both qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality measured using 6 different metrics) in single-image and temporal generation trials.

Conclusion: Conditioning on environmental context improves foundation model performance for satellite imagery, making the model promising for downstream tasks. Also created the first publicly-available dataset combining data from three different mediums.

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

*Jiuhong Xiao,Roshan Nayak,Ning Zhang,Daniel Tortei,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThermalGen is a flow-based generative model for RGB-to-thermal image translation that addresses the scarcity of synchronized RGB-thermal data through adaptive conditioning and style disentanglement, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of synchronized and calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle for visual-thermal sensor fusion and cross-modality tasks. RGB-to-thermal image translation can synthesize thermal images from abundant RGB datasets to overcome this data limitation.

Method: Proposed ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model with RGB image conditioning architecture and style-disentangled mechanism. Curated eight public RGB-T datasets and introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial datasets captured across diverse conditions.

Result: Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods. It can synthesize thermal images reflecting significant variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation model capable of synthesizing thermal images across diverse conditions, providing a promising solution for addressing the data scarcity problem in visual-thermal applications.

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses vehicle type recognition challenges caused by class imbalance in datasets, using a 16-class corpus with balanced variants created through SMOTE and undersampling. Lightweight ensembles and a ResNet-style CNN were benchmarked, with the CNN achieving superior performance (79.19% accuracy) over ensembles (74.8%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance on rare vehicle categories, limiting the effectiveness of intelligent transportation and logistics systems.

Method: Created a 16-class corpus (~47k images) from Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, then generated six balanced variants using SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Benchmarked lightweight ensembles (Random Forest, AdaBoost, soft-voting combiner on MobileNet-V2 features) against a configurable ResNet-style CNN with strong augmentation and label smoothing.

Result: Best ensemble (SMOTE-combined) achieved 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieved 79.19% on the full test set and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch. The most under-represented class (Barge) remained a failure mode despite rebalancing efforts.

Conclusion: Deep models (CNN) have advantage over ensembles, but rebalancing alone has limits for severely under-represented classes. Future work should prioritize additional minority-class collection, cost-sensitive objectives like focal loss, and hybrid ensemble-CNN pipelines to combine interpretability with representational power.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and

*Mostafa Mohaimen Akand Faisal,Rabeya Amin Jhuma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VagueGAN is an attack pipeline that crafts stealthy triggers to cause targeted changes in generative models' outputs, showing that poisoning can retain or even enhance visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore adversarial attacks on generative pipelines where small perturbations lead to controlled output changes, which is less studied compared to attacks on discriminative models.

Method: Combines PoisonerNet (modular perturbation network) with Generator-Discriminator pair to craft stealthy triggers, evaluated using custom proxy metrics and perceptual/frequency domain analysis.

Result: Poisoned outputs can display higher visual quality than clean counterparts, and latent space poisoning can retain/enhance aesthetics while producing consistent stealthy effects.

Conclusion: Latent space poisoning exposes blind spots in pixel-level defenses and raises concerns for the integrity of image generation pipelines, as optimized perturbations can be visually inconspicuous yet effective.

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

TL;DR: DWGS enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting for sparse-view novel view synthesis by integrating depth estimation, virtual view generation, and occlusion-aware reconstruction to address overfitting and structural inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies in sparse-view settings, limiting its effectiveness for novel view synthesis from limited input views.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with three components: Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation using dense matching priors, Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis for additional constraints, and Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction with depth-difference masks and learning-based inpainting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LLFF, Blender, and DTU benchmarks with up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS while maintaining real-time inference.

Conclusion: DWGS successfully addresses key limitations of 3DGS in sparse-view scenarios through integrated structural constraints and virtual view augmentation, enabling high-quality novel view synthesis from sparse inputs.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

TL;DR: DAM is a novel framework for source-free active domain adaptation that integrates multimodal supervision from Vision-and-Language models with sparse human annotations through bidirectional distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent domain adaptation studies use ViL models but treat them as separate from data supervision, lacking effective fusion between multimodal guidance and human annotations.

Method: DAM initializes stable ViL-guided targets and employs bidirectional distillation for mutual knowledge exchange between target model and dual supervisions (ViL + human annotations) during iterative adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments show DAM consistently outperforms existing methods and sets new state-of-the-art across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed DAM framework effectively integrates multimodal supervision from ViL models with human annotations through bidirectional distillation, achieving superior performance in source-free active domain adaptation.

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art
across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for automated assessment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis that predicts vertebral angles and coordinates, introduces a Vertebral Wedging Index, and achieves high diagnostic accuracy without predefined curve assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual Cobb angle measurements for scoliosis assessment suffer from significant observer variability, and existing automated methods use simplified spinal models that fail to address clinical complexity.

Method: Combines HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanical constraints to predict superior/inferior endplate angles and midpoint coordinates for each vertebra. Uses SVD for angle analysis and introduces Vertebral Wedging Index to quantify vertebral deformation.

Result: Achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55° mean absolute error on 630 full-spine radiographs. Demonstrated exceptional generalization on out-of-distribution cases. VWI showed significant prognostic correlation with curve progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and progression monitoring through its novel vertebral wedging analysis and flexible pattern detection without predefined assumptions.

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attention Surgery is an efficient framework that linearizes or hybridizes attention in pretrained video diffusion models without full retraining, reducing attention cost by up to 40% while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based video diffusion models have quadratic self-attention costs that make long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive, while prior linear attention methods fail to match softmax attention expressiveness without costly retraining.

Method: Combines hybrid attention mechanism (mixing softmax and linear tokens) with lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline, plus cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.

Result: Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B VDM, achieves first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models with 40% FLOPs reduction while maintaining quality on VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Attention Surgery successfully enables efficient sub-quadratic attention in pretrained VDMs without compromising generation quality, making high-resolution and long-sequence video generation more computationally feasible.

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenGPT-4o-Image is a large-scale dataset that addresses limitations in multimodal training data through hierarchical task taxonomy and automated generation, achieving significant performance improvements in image generation and editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for multimodal models lack systematic structure and challenging scenarios needed for real-world applications, constraining model performance in image generation and editing.

Method: Combines hierarchical task taxonomy with automated data generation using structured resource pools and GPT-4o, creating 80k instruction-image pairs across 11 domains and 51 subtasks including scientific imagery and complex instruction editing.

Result: Fine-tuning leading models on the dataset achieved up to 18% improvement on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench) and 13% improvement on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval).

Conclusion: Systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities, as demonstrated by the significant performance gains achieved through the OpenGPT-4o-Image dataset.

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

*Songze Li,Zun Wang,Gengze Zhou,Jialu Li,Xiangyu Zeng,Limin Wang,Yu Qiao,Qi Wu,Mohit Bansal,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SID is a goal-oriented language-guided navigation approach that uses self-improving demonstrations to enhance agent exploration capabilities through iterative training cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation methods rely too heavily on shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors needed for robust goal-oriented navigation in unknown environments without step-by-step instructions.

Method: SID learns an initial agent on shortest-path data, then uses this agent to generate novel exploration trajectories. These trajectories provide better demonstrations for training improved agents, creating an iterative self-improving pipeline.

Result: SID significantly boosts exploration capabilities and generalization, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 50.9% success rate on SOON validation splits, surpassing prior methods by 13.9%.

Conclusion: The self-improving demonstration pipeline effectively scales to new environments and transfers across language-guided navigation tasks, elevating performance in diverse goal-oriented navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

*Tian Xia,Matthew Sinclair,Andreas Schuh,Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro,Raghav Mehta,Rajat Rasal,Esther Puyol-Antón,Samuel Gerber,Kersten Petersen,Michiel Schaap,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seg-CFT is a method for generating counterfactual medical images that preserves structure-specific interventions without requiring pixel-level labels, producing locally coherent counterfactuals for applications like chest radiographs and coronary artery disease modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current counterfactual image generation methods rely on external classifiers and are insufficient for structure-specific interventions, often causing undesirable global effects. Previous approaches required tedious pixel-level label maps for guidance.

Method: Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT) enables interventions on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while maintaining local coherence, eliminating the need for hypothetical segmentations.

Result: The method successfully generates realistic chest radiographs and shows promising results for modeling coronary artery disease, producing effective counterfactuals without global image artifacts.

Conclusion: Seg-CFT provides a simpler and more effective approach for structure-specific counterfactual image generation in medical imaging, overcoming limitations of previous methods that required pixel-level guidance.

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates scaling GANs by training in VAE latent space and using transformer-based architectures, addressing scaling issues with intermediate supervision and learning rate adjustments, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-256.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore scalability principles for GANs, which have been effective in other generative models but remain underexplored in adversarial learning contexts.

Method: Training GANs in compact VAE latent space for efficiency, using purely transformer-based generators/discriminators, with lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning rate adjustment to address scaling issues.

Result: GAT-XL/2 achieves FID of 2.96 on ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs (6x fewer than baselines), with reliable training across various model capacities (S through XL).

Conclusion: GANs can be effectively scaled using latent-space training and transformer architectures with proper scaling solutions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced training time.

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos have temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant information, making it challenging for AI systems to achieve both completeness and efficiency in understanding. Existing LLM-based approaches struggle with this balance.

Method: Uses an interactive loop between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) that mimics human visual attention and Verification-Enhanced Reflection Agent (VERA) that verifies perceived clues to mitigate hallucination and optimize perception strategies.

Result: Achieves superior performance on EgoSchema, Video-MME, NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets. On EgoSchema, it surpasses training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and matches Gemini 1.5-Pro performance.

Conclusion: CogniGPT provides an efficient and reliable approach to long video understanding by exploring minimal informative clues through interactive perception-verification loops, inspired by human progressive visual cognition.

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

TL;DR: Temperature Scaling significantly improves calibration of CNN brain tumor classifiers under various noise conditions without affecting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable confidence estimation in medical AI systems to prevent overconfident misclassifications in high-stakes applications like brain tumor diagnosis.

Method: Developed custom CNN trained on merged brain MRI dataset, introduced 5 types of image noise (Gaussian, Poisson, Salt & Pepper, Speckle, Uniform), applied Temperature Scaling as post-hoc calibration technique.

Result: TS significantly reduced Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) under all noise conditions while maintaining classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Temperature Scaling is an effective and computationally efficient method to enhance decision confidence in medical AI systems, making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain settings.

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

*Ermanno Bartoli,Dennis Rotondi,Buwei He,Patric Jensfelt,Kai O. Arras,Iolanda Leite*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Social 3D Scene Graphs extend traditional 3D Scene Graphs to include humans, their attributes, activities, and relationships with the environment using open-vocabulary framework, enabling better social scene understanding for robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Scene Graph approaches largely ignore humans and human-environment relationships, and are limited to single image frames, making them inadequate for modeling long-range interactions needed for socially compliant robots.

Method: Introduces Social 3D Scene Graphs that capture humans, attributes, activities, and local/remote relationships in environments using open-vocabulary framework. Also creates a new benchmark with synthetic environments and comprehensive human-scene relationship annotations.

Result: The proposed representation improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment relations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Social 3D Scene Graphs pave the way toward socially intelligent robots by enabling better understanding of human interactions and relationships in 3D environments.

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using cross-modal fusion attention and self-supervised multi-event representation learning for event-based facial keypoint alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real and synthetic event datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer advantages for facial keypoint alignment in challenging conditions, but existing RGB methods don't work well on event data, and training solely on event data leads to suboptimal performance due to limited spatial information and lack of labeled datasets.

Method: Proposes cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) to integrate RGB data for robust feature extraction from event images, and self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for effective feature learning from unlabeled event data.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-event E-SIE dataset and synthetic-event WFLW-V benchmark show the approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of event-based facial keypoint alignment by leveraging cross-modal guidance and self-supervised learning, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust glioma segmentation across pre- and post-treatment scans is crucial for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning, but limited annotated data and computational costs of storing augmented 3D data pose challenges.

Method: Developed three nnU-Net-based models with different augmentation strategies: baseline without external augmentation, regular on-the-fly augmentation, and customized on-the-fly augmentation using pretrained GliGANs for dynamic tumor insertion during training.

Result: Ensemble model achieved lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH), 0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on BraTS 2025 validation, ranking first in the BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1.

Conclusion: On-the-fly augmentation with pretrained generative models effectively addresses data limitations and computational constraints for robust glioma segmentation across treatment timelines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This

TL;DR: Wan-Alpha is a framework for generating high-quality RGBA videos with transparency using a VAE-based approach and diffusion transformer trained on a new RGBA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGBA video generation methods often neglect visual quality, limiting practical usability for applications requiring transparency.

Method: Proposes a variational autoencoder that encodes alpha channel into RGB latent space, and uses a diffusion transformer trained on a high-quality RGBA video dataset.

Result: Superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and transparency rendering compared to state-of-the-art methods; can generate semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine details like hair strands.

Conclusion: Wan-Alpha successfully addresses visual quality limitations in RGBA video generation and demonstrates practical capabilities for various transparent video applications.

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent
transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of
applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting
their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new
framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha
channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that
encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of
semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as
hair strands. The released model is available on our website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDPose is a fine-tuning framework that adapts Stable Diffusion for human pose estimation by predicting keypoint heatmaps in the latent space, using a lightweight pose head and auxiliary RGB reconstruction to preserve generative priors and enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of pre-trained diffusion models for structured outputs like human pose estimation, which remains underexplored despite their success in dense prediction tasks.

Method: Directly predict keypoint heatmaps in SD U-Net's latent space, use lightweight convolutional pose head, and incorporate auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch to prevent overfitting and enhance robustness.

Result: Achieves parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on COCO with only 1/5 training schedule, sets new SOTA on cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD, and works as zero-shot pose annotator for controllable generation tasks.

Conclusion: SDPose successfully leverages diffusion priors for human pose estimation with strong cross-domain generalization and demonstrates utility as pose guidance for downstream generation tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable complete and explorable 360-degree visual worlds for downstream applications, overcoming constraints of narrow field-of-view and limited camera controllability in existing methods.

Method: Constructs large-scale panoramic video-exploration route pairs using Unreal Engine simulations, and introduces Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer that reprojects equirectangular features onto spherical surfaces to model geometric adjacency in latent space.

Result: Achieves superior performance in motion range, control precision, and visual quality compared to prior methods, demonstrating enhanced visual fidelity and spatiotemporal continuity.

Conclusion: PanoWorld-X shows strong potential for real-world applications in panoramic video generation with improved controllability and visual quality.

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

*Tooba Imtiaz,Lucy Chai,Kathryn Heal,Xuan Luo,Jungyeon Park,Jennifer Dy,John Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVT is a transformer-based architecture for large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis that avoids quadratic attention complexity by processing only local view neighborhoods with geometric-aware positional encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers have quadratic complexity that limits scalability to large scenes, while spatially nearby views provide more useful local scene information than distant views.

Method: Processes information in local neighborhoods around each view using geometric-aware positional encoding based on relative transformations between query and nearby views, then decodes into 3D Gaussian Splat representation.

Result: Enables reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward pass without quadratic attention operations.

Conclusion: LVT provides an efficient transformer architecture for large-scale 3D vision tasks by leveraging local view processing and geometric conditioning.

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

TL;DR: CLASP is a lightweight unsupervised image segmentation framework that uses self-supervised ViT features, spectral clustering, and automated parameter selection to achieve competitive performance without training or labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a simple, training-free baseline for unsupervised image segmentation that can handle large unannotated datasets commonly found in digital advertising and marketing workflows like brand safety screening and content moderation.

Method: Extracts patch features using DINO ViT encoder, builds affinity matrix, applies spectral clustering with automatic segment count selection via eigengap silhouette search, and sharpens boundaries with DenseCRF.

Result: Achieves competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K datasets, matching recent unsupervised baselines despite requiring no training.

Conclusion: CLASP provides a strong, easily reproducible baseline for unsupervised segmentation that is particularly useful for large unannotated datasets in practical applications like digital advertising workflows.

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning has shown strong reasoning in natural images but remains unexplored for Earth Observation, which has unique challenges like object detection, captioning, change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis requiring task-aware reasoning.

Method: Proposes a novel post-training framework that incorporates task-aware rewards to adapt reasoning-based RL models to diverse EO tasks, enhancing reasoning for remote sensing images while stabilizing optimization and improving robustness.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,
change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware
reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task
aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to
diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for
remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness.

### [524] [STAGE: Stable and Generalizable GRPO for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25027)
*Xiaoxiao Ma,Haibo Qiu,Guohui Zhang,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGE is a stable reinforcement learning framework for autoregressive image generation that addresses gradient conflicts and entropy instability in GRPO algorithms through advantage/KL reweighting and entropy-based rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO algorithms struggle with autoregressive image models due to training instability that disrupts pretrained capabilities, leading to marginal gains, degraded quality, and poor generalization.

Method: Introduces STAGE with two key solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting using similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting gradient updates, and 2) Entropy reward based on reference model to stabilize learning dynamics.

Result: STAGE reduces disruption of pretrained distribution, mitigates reward hacking, and improves generalization across multiple benchmarks with better visual quality and stability compared to baseline GRPO.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key limitations of GRPO for autoregressive image generation, providing more stable training and better cross-task generalization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

### [525] [VT-FSL: Bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25033)
*Wenhao Li,Qiangchang Wang,Xianjing Meng,Zhibin Wu,Yilong Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-FSL is a novel few-shot learning framework that bridges vision and text using LLMs, featuring cross-modal iterative prompting and geometric alignment to generate precise class descriptions and synthesize images, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict visual evidence due to lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections.

Method: Proposes VT-FSL with Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) that conditions LLMs on class names and support images to generate precise descriptions, and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA) that aligns textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing kernelized volume of 3D parallelotope.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: VT-FSL effectively bridges vision and text through LLMs, providing precise semantic understanding and visual diversity to compensate for limited support data, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration for superior few-shot learning.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available

In addition, an efficient method to improve robustness against camera angle
variations is also introduced by using artificially rotated training data.

TL;DR: FFDP is a distributed framework with IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels for large-scale image registration, enabling unprecedented problem sizes and significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image registration algorithms haven't scaled with modern image acquisition capabilities, creating bottlenecks for biomedical applications.

Method: Uses IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels, distributed framework with convolution-aware tensor sharding, and complements existing model parallelism techniques.

Result: Registered 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI (570x larger than clinical data) in ~1 minute using 8 GPUs; 6-7x speedup over SOTA; 20-59% memory reduction; fits 64x larger problems on single GPU.

Conclusion: FFDP enables unprecedented scale in image registration with significant performance and efficiency gains over existing methods.

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

### [528] [GEM: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and Accurate Cryo-EM Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25075)
*Huaizhi Qu,Xiao Wang,Gengwei Zhang,Jie Peng,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEM introduces a cryo-EM reconstruction framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting that achieves faster training, lower memory usage, and improved resolution compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cryo-EM reconstruction methods are computationally expensive and memory intensive for large datasets, while recent neural approaches have cubic memory overhead. There's a need for efficient real-space reconstruction that maintains accuracy.

Method: GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians (11 parameters each) and uses a novel gradient computation method for efficient training. It operates directly in real-space using 3D Gaussian Splatting instead of modeling the entire density volume.

Result: GEM achieves 48% faster training, 12% lower memory usage, and up to 38.8% improvement in local resolution compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard cryo-EM benchmarks.

Conclusion: GEM establishes a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction that unifies speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy, making it suitable for large-scale structural biology applications.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

TL;DR: BRIDGE is an RL-optimized depth-to-image generation framework that synthesizes 20M realistic RGB images with ground truth depth, enabling robust monocular depth estimation through hybrid supervision training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monocular depth estimation methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, which hinders their robustness and performance.

Method: Proposes BRIDGE framework using RL-optimized depth-to-image generation to create 20M synthetic RGB-depth pairs, then trains depth estimation model with hybrid supervision combining teacher pseudo-labels and ground truth depth.

Result: BRIDGE achieves breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in quantitative metrics and complex scene detail capture.

Conclusion: The innovative data generation and training paradigm fosters general and robust depth features, advancing monocular depth estimation capabilities.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision.
Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their
robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image

geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground
truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation
model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates
teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust
training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE
to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in
complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLat3D is a unified framework that generates 3D assets in a single stage by encoding both geometry and appearance in a single latent space, eliminating the need for separate geometry and texture generation stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional two-stage 3D generation pipelines (first geometry, then appearance) suffer from geometry-texture misalignment and high computational costs.

Method: Developed a geometry-appearance Unified VAE that compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation called UniLat, then trained a single flow-matching model to generate UniLat directly from Gaussian noise.

Result: UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image, achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The unified single-stage approach successfully addresses the misalignment and efficiency issues of traditional two-stage 3D generation methods, enabling fast and high-fidelity 3D asset creation.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&

*Xiaoyi Huang,Junwei Wu,Kejia Zhang,Carl Yang,Zhiming Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANI-Pure is a novel adversarial purification framework that uses frequency-targeted noise injection instead of uniform noise, achieving state-of-the-art robust accuracy on image classification benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial purification methods use uniform noise injection which corrupts semantic structures. The authors discovered that adversarial perturbations are concentrated in high-frequency regions with heterogeneous patterns, motivating a more targeted approach.

Method: MANI-Pure leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide purification. It adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise that suppresses adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude bands while preserving critical low-frequency content.

Result: On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, MANI-Pure narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original classifier, boosts robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves top-1 robust accuracy on RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Frequency-targeted noise injection based on magnitude spectrum analysis is an effective strategy for adversarial purification, outperforming uniform noise approaches by better preserving semantic content while improving robustness.

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Triangle Splatting+ directly optimizes triangles within a differentiable splatting framework, enabling real-time mesh-based novel view synthesis without post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are incompatible with mesh-based pipelines used in VR and graphics applications, requiring complex post-processing that degrades quality.

Method: Formulates triangle parametrization with shared vertices for connectivity, and uses a training strategy that enforces opaque triangles within differentiable splatting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples datasets, surpassing prior splatting approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient.

Conclusion: The method produces semi-connected meshes that are immediately usable in standard graphics engines and support downstream applications like physics simulation and interactive walkthroughs.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Score identity Distillation (SiD) is successfully extended to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, showing that score distillation works broadly across diffusion- and flow-based generators without major modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models produce high-quality images but suffer from slow iterative sampling. While distillation methods help, there was uncertainty about whether these techniques transfer directly to flow matching models, which are theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions.

Method: The authors provide a simple derivation using Bayes' rule and conditional expectations to unify Gaussian diffusion and flow matching. They extend SiD to various pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models (SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, FLUX.1-dev) with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments.

Result: Experiments show SiD works out of the box across all tested models in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow matching models.

Conclusion: Score distillation techniques can be successfully applied to flow matching models, resolving prior stability concerns and unifying acceleration methods across diffusion- and flow-based generators.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

TL;DR: F³ (Fast Feature Field) is a novel representation for event-based camera data that learns to predict future events from past events, enabling efficient processing at 120-440 Hz and achieving state-of-the-art performance on optical flow, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation across various robotic platforms and conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient representations for event-based camera data that can handle the sparsity of events while being robust to noise and varying event rates, enabling real-time downstream tasks in robotics.

Method: Learns representations by predicting future events from past events using multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets, exploiting event sparsity to create contiguous spatiotemporal volumes as multi-channel images.

Result: Achieves processing speeds of 120 Hz at HD and 440 Hz at VGA resolutions, with state-of-the-art performance on optical flow, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation across diverse robotic platforms (car, quadruped, flying), lighting conditions, environments, and sensor types.

Conclusion: F³ provides an efficient, robust representation for event-based vision that enables high-speed processing and superior performance on multiple computer vision tasks in challenging real-world robotic scenarios.

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

*Zhaozhi Wang,Tong Zhang,Mingyue Guo,Yaowei Wang,Qixiang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAnchor is a plug-and-play module that improves visual-spatial reasoning in MLLMs by leveraging subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limitations in visual-spatial reasoning because visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens in attention mechanisms, preventing consistent recognition of visual cues across frames.

Method: Proposes VideoAnchor module that draws connection between self-expressiveness property in sparse subspace clustering and attention mechanism in Transformers, using subspace affinities to anchor attention to shared visual structures.

Result: Achieves consistent performance gains: 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B, with qualitative improvements in subspace partitions and visual grounding.

Conclusion: VideoAnchor effectively addresses visual-spatial reasoning limitations in MLLMs through subspace affinity-based attention anchoring, demonstrating significant improvements across benchmarks and backbone models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at

### [536] [Rolling Forcing: Autoregressive Long Video Diffusion in Real Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25161)
*Kunhao Liu,Wenbo Hu,Jiale Xu,Ying Shan,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rolling Forcing is a novel video generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error accumulation through joint denoising, attention sink mechanism, and efficient training algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing streaming video generation methods suffer from severe error accumulation that degrades video quality over long horizons, limiting their practical applications in interactive world models and neural game engines.

Method: Three novel designs: 1) Joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames with progressive noise levels, 2) Attention sink mechanism to maintain global context from initial frames, 3) Efficient training algorithm for few-step distillation over extended denoising windows.

Result: Enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU with substantially reduced error accumulation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Rolling Forcing effectively addresses error accumulation in long-horizon video generation and enables high-quality, low-latency streaming video generation suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aligning pretrained visual encoders as tokenizers for latent diffusion models using a three-stage alignment strategy to create semantically rich image tokenizers that accelerate diffusion model convergence and improve generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the rich semantic structure of foundation visual encoders rather than training VAEs from scratch, which primarily focus on low-level details, to create better tokenizers for diffusion models.

Method: Three-stage alignment: (1) freeze encoder and train adapter/decoder, (2) joint optimization with semantic preservation loss, (3) decoder refinement for better reconstruction.

Result: Achieved gFID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256x256 within 64 epochs, accelerated diffusion model convergence, and outperformed FLUX VAE in 2B-parameter text-to-image model on LAION dataset.

Conclusion: The method provides a simple, scalable approach for creating semantically grounded continuous tokenizers that enhance diffusion model performance.

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

*Yuxin Jiang,Yuchao Gu,Yiren Song,Ivor Tsang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO is a visual in-context learning framework that uses diffusion transformers to perform personalized vision tasks from a single annotated example, without requiring fine-tuning or synthetic data pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision models struggle with personalized tasks defined by users at test time, and current personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or inflexible synthetic data pipelines that are restricted to fixed task formats.

Method: PICO repurposes diffusion transformers as visual in-context learners using a four-panel framework. It constructs VisRel, a diverse tuning dataset, and uses an attention-guided seed scorer for improved reliability through efficient inference scaling.

Result: PICO surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, flexibly adapts to novel user-defined tasks, and generalizes across both recognition and generation tasks without retraining.

Conclusion: The PICO framework demonstrates that task diversity rather than dataset scale drives robust generalization in visual in-context learning, enabling flexible and efficient personalized vision tasks.

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

### [540] [Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs with Layer Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25177)
*Bingkui Tong,Jiaer Xia,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerCD is a simple method that reduces hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models by contrasting output distributions from shallow vs deep visual features to filter out biased low-level information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from hallucinations - generating outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with input images, particularly with inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations. Shallow visual features are more likely to cause hallucinations as they only capture biased low-level information.

Method: Layer Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD) contrasts output distributions generated from visual features of different levels - specifically comparing shallow and deep layers of the vision encoder to filter out hallucinations.

Result: Extensive experiments on two hallucination benchmarks show that LayerCD significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LayerCD effectively reduces hallucinations in MLLMs by leveraging the observation that shallow visual features are more prone to causing hallucinations than deep visual features.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at

*Aryan Yazdan Parast,Parsa Hosseini,Hesam Asadollahzadeh,Arshia Soltani Moakhar,Basim Azam,Soheil Feizi,Naveed Akhtar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GHOST is a method that automatically generates images to induce object hallucination in MLLMs by optimizing subtle misleading cues while keeping images natural-looking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static benchmarks for studying object hallucination in MLLMs are limited and cannot uncover model-specific or unanticipated vulnerabilities.

Method: GHOST optimizes in the image embedding space to mislead models while keeping target objects absent, then guides a diffusion model to generate natural-looking images with subtle misleading cues.

Result: Achieved over 28% hallucination success rate across models, with transferable vulnerabilities (66.5% transfer from Qwen2.5-VL to GPT-4o). Generated images are high-quality and object-free.

Conclusion: GHOST serves as both a diagnostic tool for uncovering hallucination vulnerabilities and a corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems through fine-tuning.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-Gen accelerates text-to-image diffusion models for high-resolution generation by using a deeply compressed latent space with embedding alignment and minimal LoRA fine-tuning, achieving up to 138x speedup for 4K image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models face efficiency challenges at high resolutions like 4K, with previous research not addressing latent space redundancy.

Method: Uses post-training pipeline with lightweight embedding alignment to bridge representation gap between base and compressed latent spaces, followed by minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX achieve comparable quality to base models with 53x latency reduction on H100 GPU and 138x total reduction when combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant.

Conclusion: DC-Gen provides an efficient framework for accelerating high-resolution text-to-image generation while maintaining quality through latent space compression.

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency and high latency of existing video diffusion models, making them more practical for real-world applications by reducing inference time and resource requirements.

Method: Uses a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with chunk-causal temporal design for 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression, combined with AE-Adapt-V adaptation strategy for stable transfer of pre-trained models to the compressed latent space.

Result: Achieves up to 14.8x lower inference latency without quality loss, enables 2160x3840 video generation on single GPU, and requires only 10 GPU days for adaptation of Wan-2.1-14B model.

Conclusion: DC-VideoGen provides an effective post-training acceleration framework that significantly improves video generation efficiency while maintaining quality, making high-resolution video generation more accessible.

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for
efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video
diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression
latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key
innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal
temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained
Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with long videos containing substantial object deformation, large camera movement, and limited view coverage that challenge conventional reconstruction systems.

Method: Combines personalized object-centric pose estimation supervised by pre-trained image-to-3D models with deformable 3D Gaussian optimization regularized by long-term 2D point tracking across the entire video.

Result: Reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations in a category-agnostic way, showing robust performance across challenging scenarios with substantial deformation and camera movement.

Conclusion: PAD3R demonstrates strong potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D content creation by effectively handling complex deformable object reconstruction from casual monocular videos.

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelCraft is a multi-agent system that improves visual reasoning on structured images (charts, diagrams) by combining high-fidelity image processing with flexible reasoning through tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for structured image analysis suffer from low-fidelity image processing and rigid reasoning patterns, leading to cascading errors in multimodal language models.

Method: Multi-agent system with dispatcher, planner, reasoner, critics, and visual tool agents. Uses fine-tuned MLLM for pixel-level localization integrated with CV algorithms, plus dynamic three-stage workflow with image memory for adaptive reasoning.

Result: Significantly improves visual reasoning performance on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks, setting new standards for structured image reasoning.

Conclusion: PixelCraft demonstrates that combining high-fidelity processing with flexible multi-agent reasoning effectively addresses the limitations of current methods for structured image analysis.

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashI2V addresses conditional image leakage in I2V generation using latent shifting and Fourier guidance to improve generalization and performance on out-of-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V methods suffer from conditional image leakage, causing slow motion, color inconsistency, and poor performance on out-of-domain data.

Method: Proposes latent shifting to implicitly incorporate conditions by modifying flow matching distributions, and Fourier guidance using high-frequency features for better convergence and detail control.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 53.01 dynamic degree score on Vbench-I2V, outperforming larger models like CogVideoX1.5-5B and Wan2.1-14B.

Conclusion: FlashI2V effectively prevents conditional image leakage and demonstrates superior generalization capabilities for out-of-domain I2V generation.

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

*Penghao Wu,Yushan Zhang,Haiwen Diao,Bo Li,Lewei Lu,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Jigsaw is a self-supervised post-training framework that enhances MLLMs' visual understanding through ordering tasks where models reconstruct shuffled visual information by producing correct permutations in natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training paradigms for MLLMs are predominantly text-centric, using visual inputs only to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning, lacking direct vision-centric approaches that strengthen intrinsic visual understanding.

Method: Visual Jigsaw partitions visual inputs (images, videos, 3D data), shuffles them, and requires models to reconstruct the original visual information by producing correct permutations in natural language, using reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards without additional visual generative components.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial improvements in fine-grained perception, temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding across multiple visual modalities.

Conclusion: Self-supervised vision-centric tasks like Visual Jigsaw have significant potential for enhancing MLLMs' visual understanding and should inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NVS methods rely on slow and fragile SfM pipelines for 3D attributes. 3DFMs offer speed advantages but face VRAM and quality issues when scaled to dense views.

Method: Memory-efficient VGGT implementation scaling to 1000+ images, adaptive global alignment for output enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices.

Result: Substantially closes fidelity gap with COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving SOTA in dense COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation.

Conclusion: VGGT-X provides effective solutions for dense NVS with 3DFMs, with analysis of remaining gaps offering insights for future development.

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is

### [549] [From Past To Path: Masked History Learning for Next-Item Prediction in Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23649)
*KaiWen Wei,Kejun He,Xiaomian Kang,Jie Zhang,Yuming Yang,Jiang Zhong,He Bai,Junnan Zhu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Masked History Learning (MHL) improves generative recommendation by adding history reconstruction tasks to standard autoregressive training, enabling better understanding of user intent rather than just next-item prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard generative recommendation relies purely on autoregressive training, which only predicts the next item and ignores the rich internal structure of user interaction history, failing to grasp underlying user intent.

Method: Proposes MHL framework that augments autoregressive training with auxiliary history reconstruction tasks. Uses entropy-guided masking to target informative historical items and curriculum learning to transition from history reconstruction to future prediction.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets show significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art generative models, demonstrating that comprehensive understanding of past interactions is crucial for accurate future predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed MHL framework successfully addresses limitations of purely autoregressive training by enabling deeper comprehension of user history, leading to more accurate and intent-aware recommendation systems.

Abstract: Generative recommendation, which directly generates item identifiers, has
emerged as a promising paradigm for recommendation systems. However, its
potential is fundamentally constrained by the reliance on purely autoregressive
training. This approach focuses solely on predicting the next item while
ignoring the rich internal structure of a user's interaction history, thus
failing to grasp the underlying intent. To address this limitation, we propose
Masked History Learning (MHL), a novel training framework that shifts the
objective from simple next-step prediction to deep comprehension of history.
MHL augments the standard autoregressive objective with an auxiliary task of
reconstructing masked historical items, compelling the model to understand
``why'' an item path is formed from the user's past behaviors, rather than just
``what'' item comes next. We introduce two key contributions to enhance this
framework: (1) an entropy-guided masking policy that intelligently targets the
most informative historical items for reconstruction, and (2) a curriculum
learning scheduler that progressively transitions from history reconstruction
to future prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, highlighting that
a comprehensive understanding of the past is crucial for accurately predicting
a user's future path. The code will be released to the public.

*Junwei Lan,Jianlyu Chen,Zheng Liu,Chaofan Li,Siqi Bao,Defu Lian*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Retro* is a reasoning-intensive document retrieval method that uses rubric-based relevance scoring and reinforcement learning to improve retrieval of indirectly relevant documents for LLM agents and RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IR techniques struggle with fine-grained reasoning needed to retrieve documents that have indirect or implicit connections to tasks, especially for LLM agents and RAG systems. Current reasoning-enhanced IR approaches face challenges in applicability, scalability, and efficiency.

Method: Proposes Retro* with rubric-based relevance scoring that reasons about task-document relationships using explicitly defined criteria. Uses test-time scaling via multiple reasoning trajectories with score integration, and employs a novel reinforcement learning algorithm with two composite rewards to optimize reasoning capabilities.

Result: Retro* outperforms existing document retrieval methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.

Conclusion: Retro* provides an effective solution for reasoning-intensive document retrieval with improved performance, interpretability, and reliability through its rubric-based scoring and reinforcement learning optimization.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly
important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even
when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this
problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance
between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a
significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in
reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a
novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method
introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to
reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly
defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance
score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning
trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance
estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism,
which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each
training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document
retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art
performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.

### [551] [Accuracy-Robustness Trade Off via Spiking Neural Network Gradient Sparsity Trail](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23762)
*Nhan T. Luu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: SNNs naturally exhibit gradient sparsity in certain architectures, achieving state-of-the-art adversarial defense without explicit regularization, but reveal a robustness-generalization trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving adversarial robustness in SNNs for vision tasks remains underexplored, with recent approaches using sparse gradients as regularization for defense.

Method: Analysis of SNN architectural configurations that naturally exhibit gradient sparsity without requiring explicit regularization techniques.

Result: SNNs with specific architectures achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance through natural gradient sparsity, but show a trade-off where sparse gradients improve robustness while impairing generalization, and dense gradients support generalization but increase vulnerability.

Conclusion: SNNs can naturally achieve strong adversarial defense through gradient sparsity in certain configurations, but there exists a fundamental trade-off between robustness and generalization that needs careful balancing.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted growing interest in both
computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, primarily due to their
inherent energy efficiency and compact memory footprint. However, achieving
adversarial robustness in SNNs, particularly for vision-related tasks, remains
a nascent and underexplored challenge. Recent studies have proposed leveraging
sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against
adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under
specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity
and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the
need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off
between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to
improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to
generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but
increase vulnerability to attacks.

*Nhan T. Luu,Duong T. Luu,Pham Ngoc Nam,Truong Cong Thang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: Proposes a novel hybrid ANN-SNN framework with layer-wise encode-decode SNN blocks integrated into ANN pipelines, using surrogate gradients for bit-plane-based spike encoding to enable end-to-end differentiable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid ANN-SNN approaches lack deep layer-wise cooperation during backpropagation due to non-differentiability of spike encoding functions, leading to strict separation between components or limited integration.

Method: Integrates layer-wise encode-decode SNN blocks within conventional ANN pipelines using surrogate gradients for bit-plane-based spike encoding function, enabling end-to-end differentiable training across ANN and SNN layers.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art pure ANN and SNN models while retaining the potential efficiency and temporal representation benefits of spiking computation.

Conclusion: This is the first implementation of surrogate gradient for bit plane coding and spike encoder interface in hybrid ANN-SNN context, creating a new class of hybrid models that opens new research directions.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant traction in both
computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence for their potential in
energy-efficient computing. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs)
excel at gradient-based optimization and high accuracy. This contrast has
consequently led to a growing subfield of hybrid ANN-SNN research. However,
existing hybrid approaches often rely on either a strict separation between ANN
and SNN components or employ SNN-only encoders followed by ANN classifiers due
to the constraints of non-differentiability of spike encoding functions,
causing prior hybrid architectures to lack deep layer-wise cooperation during
backpropagation. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid ANN-SNN
framework that integrates layer-wise encode-decode SNN blocks within
conventional ANN pipelines. Central to our method is the use of surrogate
gradients for a bit-plane-based spike encoding function, enabling end-to-end
differentiable training across ANN and SNN layers. This design achieves
competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art pure ANN and SNN models while
retaining the potential efficiency and temporal representation benefits of
spiking computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
implementation of a surrogate gradient for bit plane coding specifically and
spike encoder interface in general to be utilized in the context of hybrid
ANN-SNN, successfully leading to a new class of hybrid models that pave new
directions for future research.

*Nikolas McNeal,N. Apurva Ratan Murty*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: ANN-based brain models are fragile to small adversarial perturbations despite high prediction accuracy. Adversarial probes reveal unreliable local coding directions and provide a stronger evaluation criterion than prediction accuracy alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With many ANN models achieving similar predictive accuracy for neural responses, there's a need for stronger criteria to evaluate brain models beyond just prediction scores.

Method: Used small-scale adversarial probes to characterize local representational geometry of ANN-based brain models, testing sensitivity to imperceptible perturbations.

Result: Most contemporary ANN brain models are unexpectedly fragile, their sensitivity to adversarial probes better discriminates between models than accuracy, and robust models produce generalizable, semantically meaningful changes.

Conclusion: Local representational geometry provides a stronger criterion for brain model evaluation, and robust models with stable coding axes better align with neural selectivity and generate testable predictions.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become the de facto standard for
modeling the human visual system, primarily due to their success in predicting
neural responses. However, with many models now achieving similar predictive
accuracy, we need a stronger criterion. Here, we use small-scale adversarial
probes to characterize the local representational geometry of many highly
predictive ANN-based brain models. We report four key findings. First, we show
that most contemporary ANN-based brain models are unexpectedly fragile. Despite
high prediction scores, their response predictions are highly sensitive to
small, imperceptible perturbations, revealing unreliable local coding
directions. Second, we demonstrate that a model's sensitivity to adversarial
probes can better discriminate between candidate neural encoding models than
prediction accuracy alone. Third, we find that standard models rely on distinct
local coding directions that do not transfer across model architectures.
Finally, we show that adversarial probes from robustified models produce
generalizable and semantically meaningful changes, suggesting that they capture
the local coding dimensions of the visual system. Together, our work shows that
local representational geometry provides a stronger criterion for brain model
evaluation. We also provide empirical grounds for favoring robust models, whose
more stable coding axes not only align better with neural selectivity but also
generate concrete, testable predictions for future experiments.

*Haider Al-Tahan,Mayukh Deb,Jenelle Feather,N. Apurva Ratan Murty*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: TopoAudio is a new topographic auditory model that incorporates cortical wiring constraints to develop biologically plausible topographic organization in auditory cortex representations, matching standard models' performance while exhibiting emergent tonotopic maps and speech/music selectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational models of auditory perception lack the topographic structure observed in human auditory cortex, where neurons with similar response properties are spatially clustered into organized maps.

Method: Adapted cortical wiring-constraint loss from visual perception to auditory models, training TopoAudio to classify sounds from cochleagram inputs with added constraint that nearby units on a 2D cortical sheet develop similar tuning.

Result: TopoAudio achieves comparable accuracy to non-topographic baseline models, predicts fMRI responses equally well, and develops smooth topographic maps for tonotopy, amplitude modulation, and clustered modules for music and speech selectivity.

Conclusion: TopoAudio is the first end-to-end biologically grounded auditory model with emergent topography, demonstrating that wiring-length constraints can serve as general-purpose regularization for biologically aligned representations.

Abstract: The human auditory cortex is topographically organized. Neurons with similar
response properties are spatially clustered, forming smooth maps for acoustic
features such as frequency in early auditory areas, and modular regions
selective for music and speech in higher-order cortex. Yet, evaluations for
current computational models of auditory perception do not measure whether such
topographic structure is present in a candidate model. Here, we show that
cortical topography is not present in the previous best-performing models at
predicting human auditory fMRI responses. To encourage the emergence of
topographic organization, we adapt a cortical wiring-constraint loss originally
designed for visual perception. The new class of topographic auditory models,
TopoAudio, are trained to classify speech, and environmental sounds from
cochleagram inputs, with an added constraint that nearby units on a 2D cortical
sheet develop similar tuning. Despite these additional constraints, TopoAudio
achieves high accuracy on benchmark tasks comparable to the unconstrained
non-topographic baseline models. Further, TopoAudio predicts the fMRI responses
in the brain as well as standard models, but unlike standard models, TopoAudio
develops smooth, topographic maps for tonotopy and amplitude modulation (common
properties of early auditory representation, as well as clustered response
modules for music and speech (higher-order selectivity observed in the human
auditory cortex). TopoAudio is the first end-to-end biologically grounded
auditory model to exhibit emergent topography, and our results emphasize that a
wiring-length constraint can serve as a general-purpose regularization tool to
achieve biologically aligned representations.

*Wei Zhang,Qiufan Lin,Yuan-Sen Ting,Shupei Chen,Hengxin Ruan,Song Li,Yifan Wang*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper uses interpretability techniques (causal analysis and mutual information decomposition) to understand how deep learning models estimate galaxy stellar mass from multi-band images, revealing the physical contributions beyond just integrated photometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how additional information beyond integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes to deep learning-based galaxy property estimation, enabling better physical interpretation and optimization of data exploitation in astrophysics.

Method: Combines causal analysis and mutual information decomposition techniques to interpret deep learning models that estimate stellar mass from SDSS and WISE multi-band galaxy images, revealing causal paths and quantifying redundant, unique, and synergistic information contributions.

Result: Obtained meaningful physical interpretations for image-based models, demonstrating how different input data components contribute to stellar mass estimation and revealing causal relationships beyond statistical associations.

Conclusion: The combination of deep learning with interpretability techniques provides valuable insights for astrophysical research, enabling better understanding of physical processes and promoting more data-driven approaches in astrophysical parameter estimation.

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning models fed with multi-band galaxy images are
powerful data-driven tools used to estimate galaxy physical properties in the
absence of spectroscopy. However, due to a lack of interpretability and the
associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the
information additional to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes
to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable
further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy
properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at
interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two
interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information
decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables
beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the
multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of
different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE),
we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for
image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep
learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more
data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations
and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).

Abstract: Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) has been established as a high-accuracy
3D reconstruction method capable of achieving sub-pixel accuracy. However, this
technique faces significant constraints due to complex calibration
requirements, bulky system footprint, and sensitivity to environmental

from calibration to reconstruction with full mathematical fidelity to the
underlying principles of structured light. We conduct comprehensive virtual
calibration and validate our system's reconstruction accuracy through
quantitative comparison against ground truth geometry. Additionally, we
demonstrate the ability to model the virtual system as a digital twin by
replicating a physical FPP system in simulation and validating correspondence
between virtual and real-world measurements. Experimental results demonstrate
that VIRTUS-FPP accurately models optical phenomena critical to FPP and
achieves results comparable to real-world systems while offering unprecedented
flexibility for system configuration, sensor prototyping, and environmental

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cataract is a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide, and early detection from retinal imaging is critical for timely intervention.

Method: Evaluated CNNs, transformers, lightweight architectures, and knowledge-distilled models on the Ocular Disease Recognition dataset (5000 patients). Used Swin-Base Transformer as teacher model and distilled MobileNetV3 as student model, with a dual-eye Siamese variant.

Conclusion: Accurate, interpretable cataract detection is achievable even with lightweight models, supporting potential clinical integration in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Cataract remains a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide, and early
detection from retinal imaging is critical for timely intervention. We present
a deep learning pipeline for cataract classification using the Ocular Disease

trained with Swin-Base knowledge, reached 98.42% accuracy and a 0.9787 F1-score
with greatly reduced computational cost. The proposed dual-eye Siamese variant
of the distilled MobileNet, integrating information from both eyes, achieved an

*Zihan Wei,Tapabrata Chakraborti*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel fairness-aware method for skin lesion classification that combines skin tone normalization with meta learning-based channel pruning to mitigate bias across multiple demographic attributes without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias mitigation methods either degrade accuracy or only address single attributes, and most are not integrated into model learning itself. Current approaches are typically pre-hoc or post-hoc rather than embedded in the training process.

Method: Proposes ITA Loss-based skin tone normalization for dataset balancing and an adaptable meta learning-based joint channel pruning framework with nested optimization loops to find critical channels while maintaining fairness across attributes.

Result: Experiments on ISIC2019 dataset show the method effectively improves fairness on multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously without significant accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses multiple bias mitigation challenges, though pruning adds computational cost during training (which is typically done offline anyway).

Abstract: Recent works have shown that deep learning based skin lesion image
classification models trained on unbalanced dataset can exhibit bias toward
protected demographic attributes such as race, age,and gender. Current bias
mitigation methods usually either achieve high level of fairness with the
degradation of accuracy, or only improve the model fairness on a single
attribute. Additionally usually most bias mitigation strategies are either pre
hoc through data processing or post hoc through fairness evaluation, instead of
being integrated into the model learning itself. To solve these existing
drawbacks, we propose a new Individual Typology Angle (ITA) Loss-based skin
tone normalization and data augmentation method that directly feeds into an
adaptable meta learning-based joint channel pruning framework. In skin tone
normalization, ITA is used to estimate skin tone type and adjust automatically
to target tones for dataset balancing. In the joint channel pruning framework,
two nested optimization loops are used to find critical channels.The inner
optimization loop finds and prunes the local critical channels by weighted soft
nearest neighbor loss, and the outer optimization loop updates the weight of
each attribute using group wise variance loss on meta-set. Experiments
conducted in the ISIC2019 dataset validate the effectiveness of our method in
simultaneously improving the fairness of the model on multiple sensitive
attributes without significant degradation of accuracy. Finally, although the
pruning mechanism adds some computational cost during training phase, usually
training is done off line. More importantly,

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PnP-CM, a plug-and-play framework that reinterprets consistency models as proximal operators for solving inverse problems, achieving high-quality reconstructions in just 2-4 neural function evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing consistency model-based inverse problem solvers either require task-specific training or use slow-converging data fidelity operations, making them unsuitable for large-scale problems.

Method: Reinterpret consistency models as proximal operators and integrate them into PnP-ADMM framework with conjugate gradient acceleration, noise injection, and momentum techniques.

Result: PnP-CM achieves high-quality reconstructions in 2-4 NFEs across various inverse problems (inpainting, super-resolution, deblurring, MRI), outperforming comparable CM-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed PnP-CM framework effectively solves real-world inverse problems with minimal computational cost while maintaining convergence properties.

Abstract: Diffusion models have found extensive use in solving numerous inverse
problems. Such diffusion inverse problem solvers aim to sample from the
posterior distribution of data given the measurements, using a combination of
the unconditional score function and an approximation of the posterior related
to the forward process. Recently, consistency models (CMs) have been proposed
to directly predict the final output from any point on the diffusion ODE
trajectory, enabling high-quality sampling in just a few NFEs. CMs have also
been utilized for inverse problems, but existing CM-based solvers either
require additional task-specific training or utilize data fidelity operations
with slow convergence, not amenable to large-scale problems. In this work, we
reinterpret CMs as proximal operators of a prior, enabling their integration
into plug-and-play (PnP) frameworks. We propose a solver based on PnP-ADMM,
which enables us to leverage the fast convergence of conjugate gradient method.
We further accelerate this with noise injection and momentum, dubbed PnP-CM,
and show it maintains the convergence properties of the baseline PnP-ADMM. We
evaluate our approach on a variety of inverse problems, including inpainting,
super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CM trained for
MRI datasets. Our results show that PnP-CM achieves high-quality
reconstructions in as few as 4 NFEs, and can produce meaningful results in 2
steps, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world inverse problems while
outperforming comparable CM-based approaches.

*Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui,Mohammed Imamul Hassan Bhuiyan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: S³F-Net is a dual-branch framework that combines spatial CNN with spectral analysis (SpectraNet) for medical image analysis, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets by learning from both spatial and frequency domains simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs focus only on spatial features, which is inefficient for capturing global patterns and fails to model frequency-domain characteristics. There's a need to leverage both spatial and spectral representations for better medical image analysis.

Method: Proposed S³F-Net with dual branches: deep spatial CNN and shallow spectral encoder (SpectraNet) featuring SpectralFilter layer that applies learnable filters to Fourier spectrum via element-wise multiplication, achieving global receptive field instantly. Uses fusion methods like Bilinear Fusion and Concatenation Fusion.

Result: Consistently outperforms spatial-only baseline across 4 medical imaging datasets with accuracy improvements up to 5.13%. Achieves 98.76% accuracy on BRISC2025 (SOTA competitive) and 93.11% on Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, surpassing deeper models. Explainability shows dynamic branch reliance based on input pathology.

Conclusion: The dual-domain approach combining spatial and spectral analysis is a powerful and generalizable paradigm for medical image analysis, with demonstrated effectiveness across different modalities and pathologies.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks have become a cornerstone of medical image
analysis due to their proficiency in learning hierarchical spatial features.
However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global,
holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domain
characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral
Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns
from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net
performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral
encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer,
which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters
directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient
element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a
global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a
lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical
imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and
generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its
strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to
5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive
accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs
better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11%
accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our
explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically
adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results
verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm
for medical image analysis.

Conclusion: UTMB adopted Zauron's Guardian Pro software system-wide to ensure accurate AI-enhanced peer review and coding, improving both patient care and financial outcomes.

Abstract: This case study details The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)'s
partnership with Zauron Labs, Inc. to enhance detection and coding of aortic
calcifications (ACs) using chest radiographs. ACs are often underreported
despite their significant prognostic value for cardiovascular disease, and UTMB

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multiparametric MRI has limitations including false positives/negatives and interobserver variability. TDD-MRI shows promise for better tissue characterization, and combining it with AI could provide more accurate, zone-specific risk prediction.

Method: Prospective evaluation of PROSTDAI (AI-enhanced TDD-MRI software) in routine diagnostic care, comparing it against standard PI-RADS v2.1 assessment, with validation using MRI-guided prostate biopsy results.

Result: Protocol paper - no results presented yet. The study aims to assess the added value of PROSTDAI over current standard methods.

Conclusion: This protocol outlines a systematic approach to validate whether AI-enhanced TDD-MRI can improve prostate cancer diagnosis accuracy and reduce dependence on reader training compared to current standard-of-care methods.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in men and
the eighth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)
has become central to the diagnostic pathway for men at intermediate risk,
improving de-tection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) while reducing
unnecessary biopsies and over-diagnosis. However, mpMRI remains limited by
false positives, false negatives, and moderate to substantial interobserver

*Jiaye Fu,Qiankun Gao,Chengxiang Wen,Yanmin Wu,Siwei Ma,Jiaqi Zhang,Jian Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ReCon-GS is a storage-aware framework for online free-viewpoint video reconstruction that uses multi-level Anchor Gaussians and dynamic hierarchy reconfiguration to achieve high fidelity with 50% less memory and 15% faster training than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in online FVV reconstruction including slow per-frame optimization, inconsistent motion estimation, and unsustainable storage demands.

Method: Dynamically allocate multi-level Anchor Gaussians in density-adaptive fashion, use dynamic hierarchy reconfiguration with anchor re-hierarchization, and implement storage-aware optimization that adjusts Gaussian density for memory-performance trade-off.

Result: Improves training efficiency by ~15%, achieves superior FVV synthesis quality with enhanced robustness and stability, and reduces memory requirements by over 50% at equivalent rendering quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ReCon-GS enables high-fidelity online dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time rendering with significantly reduced storage requirements while maintaining superior performance.

Abstract: Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) reconstruction is challenged by slow
per-frame optimization, inconsistent motion estimation, and unsustainable
storage demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Reconfigurable
Continuum Gaussian Stream, dubbed ReCon-GS, a novel storage-aware framework
that enables high fidelity online dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time
rendering. Specifically, we dynamically allocate multi-level Anchor Gaussians
in a density-adaptive fashion to capture inter-frame geometric deformations,
thereby decomposing scene motion into compact coarse-to-fine representations.
Then, we design a dynamic hierarchy reconfiguration strategy that preserves
localized motion expressiveness through on-demand anchor re-hierarchization,
while ensuring temporal consistency through intra-hierarchical deformation
inheritance that confines transformation priors to their respective hierarchy
levels. Furthermore, we introduce a storage-aware optimization mechanism that
flexibly adjusts the density of Anchor Gaussians at different hierarchy levels,
enabling a controllable trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and memory
usage. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that,
compared to state-of-the-art methods, ReCon-GS improves training efficiency by
approximately 15% and achieves superior FVV synthesis quality with enhanced
robustness and stability. Moreover, at equivalent rendering quality, ReCon-GS
slashes memory requirements by over 50% compared to leading state-of-the-art
methods.

*Wankun Chen,Feng Gao,Yanhai Gan,Jingchao Cao,Junyu Dong,Qian Du*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes WMSR, a Wavelet-assisted Mamba Super-Resolution framework for sea surface temperature data, achieving state-of-the-art performance by combining low-frequency state space modeling with high-frequency enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining high-resolution SST data is challenging due to physical imaging limitations, and existing deep learning approaches haven't fully explored Mamba-based State Space Models for SST super-resolution despite their potential for long-range dependency modeling.

Method: WMSR framework with two key components: Low-Frequency State Space Module (LFSSM) using 2D-SSM for global information capture, and High-Frequency Enhancement Module (HFEM) using pixel difference convolution for texture correction.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three SST datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed WMSR framework effectively addresses SST super-resolution challenges by leveraging Mamba-based SSMs and achieves excellent results, with code and datasets to be made publicly available.

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential indicator of global climate
change and one of the most intuitive factors reflecting ocean conditions.
Obtaining high-resolution SST data remains challenging due to limitations in
physical imaging, and super-resolution via deep neural networks is a promising
solution. Recently, Mamba-based approaches leveraging State Space Models (SSM)
have demonstrated significant potential for long-range dependency modeling with
linear complexity. However, their application to SST data super-resolution
remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the Wavelet-assisted Mamba
Super-Resolution (WMSR) framework for satellite-derived SST data. The WMSR
includes two key components: the Low-Frequency State Space Module (LFSSM) and
High-Frequency Enhancement Module (HFEM). The LFSSM uses 2D-SSM to capture
global information of the input data, and the robust global modeling
capabilities of SSM are exploited to preserve the critical temperature
information in the low-frequency component. The HFEM employs the pixel
difference convolution to match and correct the high-frequency feature,
achieving accurate and clear textures. Through comprehensive experiments on
three SST datasets, our WMSR demonstrated superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/oucailab/WMSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of diabetic retinopathy is crucial for timely intervention to prevent vision loss and effectively manage diabetic complications.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Preprocessing with fuzzy filtering, non-linear diffusion filtering, and novel AVDS filter using four distance methods; 2) Segmentation using Improved Mask R-CNN; 3) Feature extraction and classification using novel Self-Spatial Attention infused VGG-16 (SSA-VGG-16).

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates effectiveness for DR and DME detection and grading, validated on IDRiD and MESSIDOR datasets.

Abstract: Early detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is crucial as it allows for
timely intervention, preventing vision loss and enabling effective management
of diabetic complications. This research performs detection of DR and DME at an
early stage through the proposed framework which includes three stages:
preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. In the
preprocessing stage, noise filtering is performed by fuzzy filtering, artefact
removal is performed by non-linear diffusion filtering, and the contrast
improvement is performed by a novel filter called Adaptive Variable Distance
Speckle (AVDS) filter. The AVDS filter employs four distance calculation
methods such as Euclidean, Bhattacharya, Manhattan, and Hamming. The filter
adaptively chooses a distance method which produces the highest contrast value
amongst all 3 methods. From the analysis, hamming distance method was found to
achieve better results for contrast and Euclidean distance showing less error
value with high PSNR. The segmentation stage is performed using Improved
Mask-Regional Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask RCNN). In the final stage,
feature extraction and classification using novel Self-Spatial Attention
infused VGG-16 (SSA-VGG-16), which effectively captures both global contextual
relationships and critical spatial regions within retinal images, thereby
improving the accuracy and robustness of DR and DME detection and grading. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed using two distinct datasets:
IDRiD and MESSIDOR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building TTS systems for dialects is challenging due to scarce data, inconsistent orthographies, and complex phonetic variation, which limits accessibility to dialect speech technology.

Method: Uses IPA-based framework to standardize phonetic representations, dialect-aware Mixture-of-Experts for phonological modeling, and parameter-efficient adaptation with LoRA and Conditioning Adapters for rapid dialect transfer.

Result: Achieves natural and expressive speech generation with zero-shot performance on unseen dialects and specialized domains like Peking Opera using only a few hours of data.

Conclusion: DiaMoE-TTS enables scalable, open-data-driven dialect TTS synthesis that overcomes data scarcity and orthographic inconsistencies while supporting rapid adaptation to new dialects.

Abstract: Dialect speech embodies rich cultural and linguistic diversity, yet building
text-to-speech (TTS) systems for dialects remains challenging due to scarce
data, inconsistent orthographies, and complex phonetic variation. To address
these issues, we present DiaMoE-TTS, a unified IPA-based framework that
standardizes phonetic representations and resolves grapheme-to-phoneme
ambiguities. Built upon the F5-TTS architecture, the system introduces a
dialect-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to model phonological differences and
employs parameter-efficient adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptors (LoRA) and
Conditioning Adapters for rapid transfer to new dialects. Unlike approaches
dependent on large-scale or proprietary resources, DiaMoE-TTS enables scalable,
open-data-driven synthesis. Experiments demonstrate natural and expressive
speech generation, achieving zero-shot performance on unseen dialects and
specialized domains such as Peking Opera with only a few hours of data.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of cascaded pipelines that isolate speech synthesis, enabling efficient cross-modal interaction and low-latency streaming speech generation with stable timbre over extended durations.

Method: Uses a "brain-mouth" design with dual-track token-based architecture, unified training strategy with dual audio encoder for long-form audio perception, and chunk-based parallel decoding to accelerate inference and support streaming zero-shot voice cloning.

Conclusion: MGM-Omni establishes an efficient, end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalized long-horizon speech generation.

Abstract: We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and
expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that
isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a
dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal
reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient
cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For
understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder
design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions.
For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech
token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice
cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent
work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient
training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing
open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences,
producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form

*Kai Li,Kejun Gao,Xiaolin Hu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Dolphin is an efficient audio-visual speech separation method that achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational cost through lightweight visual encoding and global-local attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AVSS methods have large parameter counts and high computational costs, making them impractical for applications where speech separation is just a preprocessing step.

Method: Uses DP-LipCoder (dual-path lightweight video encoder) to convert lip-motion into discrete audio-aligned semantic tokens, and a lightweight encoder-decoder separator with global-local attention blocks for multi-scale dependency capture.

Result: Surpassed SOTA in separation quality while achieving over 50% fewer parameters, 2.4x reduction in MACs, and over 6x faster GPU inference speed on three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Dolphin provides a practical and deployable solution for high-performance AVSS in real-world scenarios with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: Audio-visual speech separation (AVSS) methods leverage visual cues to extract
target speech and have demonstrated strong separation quality in noisy acoustic
environments. However, these methods usually involve a large number of
parameters and require high computational cost, which is unacceptable in many
applications where speech separation serves as only a preprocessing step for
further speech processing. To address this issue, we propose an efficient AVSS
method, named Dolphin. For visual feature extraction, we develop DP-LipCoder, a
dual-path lightweight video encoder that transforms lip-motion into discrete
audio-aligned semantic tokens. For audio separation, we construct a lightweight
encoder-decoder separator, in which each layer incorporates a global-local
attention (GLA) block to efficiently capture multi-scale dependencies.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets showed that Dolphin not only surpassed
the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model in separation quality but also
achieved remarkable improvements in efficiency: over 50% fewer parameters, more
than 2.4x reduction in MACs, and over 6x faster GPU inference speed. These
results indicate that Dolphin offers a practical and deployable solution for
high-performance AVSS in real-world scenarios. Our code and demo page are
publicly available at http://cslikai.cn/Dolphin/.

TL;DR: An unsupervised ML algorithm discovers "music-words" (recurring patterns) from symbolic music data using a two-stage EM framework, achieving 0.61 IoU against human annotations and demonstrating that minimizing code length resolves semantic ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify fundamental musical patterns that reflect cognitive composition processes, addressing the challenge of semantic ambiguity in musical interpretation.

Method: Two-stage Expectation-Maximization framework: 1) Develop music-word dictionary, 2) Reconstruct music data, formulated as a statistical optimization problem.

Result: Achieved 0.61 Intersection over Union score against human expert annotations, showing that minimizing code length effectively addresses semantic ambiguity.

Conclusion: The approach enables computers to extract basic musical building blocks, supporting AI music applications (generation, classification, style transfer) and musicology analysis of compositional patterns and minimal encoding principles.

Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that
identifies recurring patterns -- referred to as ``music-words'' -- from
symbolic music data. These patterns are fundamental to musical structure and
reflect the cognitive processes involved in composition. However, extracting
these patterns remains challenging because of the inherent semantic ambiguity
in musical interpretation. We formulate the task of music-word discovery as a
statistical optimization problem and propose a two-stage
Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based learning framework: 1. Developing a
music-word dictionary; 2. Reconstructing the music data. When evaluated against
human expert annotations, the algorithm achieved an Intersection over Union
(IoU) score of 0.61. Our findings indicate that minimizing code length
effectively addresses semantic ambiguity, suggesting that human optimization of
encoding systems shapes musical semantics. This approach enables computers to
extract ``basic building blocks'' from music data, facilitating structural
analysis and sparse encoding. The method has two primary applications. First,
in AI music, it supports downstream tasks such as music generation,
classification, style transfer, and improvisation. Second, in musicology, it
provides a tool for analyzing compositional patterns and offers insights into
the principle of minimal encoding across diverse musical styles and composers.

*Weidan Xiong,Yongli Wu,Bochuan Zeng,Jianwei Guo,Dani Lischinski,Daniel Cohen-Or,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Automated method for generating realistic texture maps for architectural proxy models from unordered photographs using differentiable rendering optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proxy models lose fine geometric details during simplification, requiring textures to compensate, but preserving rich texture information from dense reconstructions is challenging with unordered RGB photos.

Method: Establishes texel-pixel correspondences on UV maps, computes texel colors as weighted blends of associated pixels, and optimizes blending parameters using differentiable rendering for photometric/perspective consistency and seamless texture coherence.

Result: Method effectively generates high-quality textures across diverse architectural models and varying photographic conditions, preserving visual fidelity and structural detail.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables robust creation of realistic texture maps for architectural proxy models directly from unordered photo collections.

Abstract: Simplified proxy models are commonly used to represent architectural
structures, reducing storage requirements and enabling real-time rendering.
However, the geometric simplifications inherent in proxies result in a loss of
fine color and geometric details, making it essential for textures to
compensate for the loss. Preserving the rich texture information from the
original dense architectural reconstructions remains a daunting task,
particularly when working with unordered RGB photographs. We propose an
automated method for generating realistic texture maps for architectural proxy
models at the texel level from an unordered collection of registered
photographs. Our approach establishes correspondences between texels on a UV
map and pixels in the input images, with each texel's color computed as a
weighted blend of associated pixel values. Using differentiable rendering, we
optimize blending parameters to ensure photometric and perspective consistency,
while maintaining seamless texture coherence. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse architectural
models and varying photographic conditions, enabling the creation of
high-quality textures that preserve visual fidelity and structural detail.

TL;DR: A method that jointly optimizes both continuous and discrete parameters in compound lens design using gradient-based optimization combined with tailored MCMC sampling, enabling automated exploration of expanded design space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods only optimize continuous parameters and require expert intervention for topology changes, limiting automated lens design capabilities.

Method: Combines gradient-based optimization with tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling using transdimensional mutation and paraxial projection operations.

Result: Effectively explores expanded design space, produces better designs than previous methods, and pushes speed-sharpness tradeoffs in automated lens design.

Conclusion: The method enables fully automated optimization of both continuous and discrete lens parameters, advancing the state of automated compound lens design.

Abstract: We introduce a method that automatically and jointly updates both continuous
and discrete parameters of a compound lens design, to improve its performance
in terms of sharpness, speed, or both. Previous methods for compound lens
design use gradient-based optimization to update continuous parameters (e.g.,
curvature of individual lens elements) of a given lens topology, requiring
extensive expert intervention to realize topology changes. By contrast, our
method can additionally optimize discrete parameters such as number and type
(e.g., singlet or doublet) of lens elements. Our method achieves this
capability by combining gradient-based optimization with a tailored Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm, using transdimensional mutation and
paraxial projection operations for efficient global exploration. We show
experimentally on a variety of lens design tasks that our method effectively
explores an expanded design space of compound lenses, producing better designs
than previous methods and pushing the envelope of speed-sharpness tradeoffs
achievable by automated lens design.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ZeroScene is a zero-shot system for 3D scene reconstruction and texture editing that uses large vision models to extract object-level information and jointly optimizes 3D/2D losses for coherent scene generation with multi-view consistent texture editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single image scene reconstruction methods struggle with balancing individual asset quality and overall scene coherence, while texture editing techniques often fail to maintain both local continuity and multi-view consistency in complex environments.

Method: Extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information to infer spatial relationships, jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of point clouds to update object poses for scene alignment, and uses mask-guided progressive image generation with diffusion model constraints for texture editing with PBR material estimation.

Result: Experimental results show the framework ensures geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, faithfully reconstructs scene layouts, and produces highly detailed textures that closely align with text prompts.

Conclusion: ZeroScene successfully addresses the challenges in 3D content generation by providing a unified approach for both scene reconstruction and texture editing while maintaining quality, coherence, and multi-view consistency.

Abstract: In the field of 3D content generation, single image scene reconstruction
methods still struggle to simultaneously ensure the quality of individual
assets and the coherence of the overall scene in complex environments, while
texture editing techniques often fail to maintain both local continuity and
multi-view consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene,
which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both
single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot
manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information
from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then
jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update
object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent
and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background.
Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By
imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided
progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture
consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of
rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the
geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully
reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely
align with text prompts.

Motivation: Traditional point cloud completion methods use fixed local region partitioning (like k-nearest neighbors) which fails to handle uneven geometric complexity distribution, leading to inefficient representation and poor reconstruction in detailed areas.

Method: Proposes Degree-Flexible Point Graph Completion Network (DFG-PCN) with adaptive node degree assignment using feature variation and curvature metrics, plus a geometry-aware graph integration module using Manhattan distance for edge aggregation and detail-guided feature fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show the method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed DFG-PCN framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional methods by adaptively handling varying geometric complexity, achieving superior point cloud completion performance.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a vital task focused on reconstructing complete
point clouds and addressing the incompleteness caused by occlusion and limited
sensor resolution. Traditional methods relying on fixed local region
partitioning, such as k-nearest neighbors, which fail to account for the highly
uneven distribution of geometric complexity across different regions of a
shape. This limitation leads to inefficient representation and suboptimal
reconstruction, especially in areas with fine-grained details or structural
discontinuities. This paper proposes a point cloud completion framework called
Degree-Flexible Point Graph Completion Network (DFG-PCN). It adaptively assigns
node degrees using a detail-aware metric that combines feature variation and
curvature, focusing on structurally important regions. We further introduce a
geometry-aware graph integration module that uses Manhattan distance for edge
aggregation and detail-guided fusion of local and global features to enhance
representation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches.

Motivation: Most existing 3D generative models struggle to generate controllable point cloud shapes that meet user-specific requirements, which hinders large-scale application of 3D point cloud generation.

Method: The approach involves: 1) manually annotating adjacency relationships to construct StructureGraph representation, 2) StructureGraphNet module for structure-aware latent features, 3) cCNF Prior module to learn latent feature distribution controlled by part adjacency, and 4) Diffusion Transformer module conditioned on latent features and part adjacency to generate structure-consistent point clouds.

Result: Experimental results show the method produces high-quality and diverse point cloud shapes, enabling generation of controllable point clouds based on user-specified shape structures and achieving state-of-the-art performance on ShapeNet dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed structure-controllable 3D point cloud generation method successfully addresses the control challenge and demonstrates effective generation of controllable point clouds with specified shape structures.

Abstract: In the field of 3D point cloud generation, numerous 3D generative models have
demonstrated the ability to generate diverse and realistic 3D shapes. However,
the majority of these approaches struggle to generate controllable 3D point
cloud shapes that meet user-specific requirements, hindering the large-scale
application of 3D point cloud generation. To address the challenge of lacking
control in 3D point cloud generation, we are the first to propose controlling
the generation of point clouds by shape structures that comprise part
existences and part adjacency relationships. We manually annotate the adjacency
relationships between the segmented parts of point cloud shapes, thereby
constructing a StructureGraph representation. Based on this StructureGraph
representation, we introduce StrucADT, a novel structure-controllable point
cloud generation model, which consists of StructureGraphNet module to extract
structure-aware latent features, cCNF Prior module to learn the distribution of
the latent features controlled by the part adjacency, and Diffusion Transformer
module conditioned on the latent features and part adjacency to generate

TL;DR: Diff-3DCap is a 3D shape captioning method that uses projected views and continuous diffusion models to generate captions, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring additional classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D shape captioning methods rely on expensive voxel representations or object detection techniques but often deliver unsatisfactory results, creating a need for more effective approaches.

Method: The method uses projected views to represent 3D objects and employs a continuous diffusion model that perturbs embedded captions with Gaussian noise during forward phase, then predicts reconstructed annotations during reverse phase. It leverages visual embeddings from pre-trained visual-language models as guiding signals.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Diff-3DCap achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods in 3D shape captioning.

Conclusion: Diff-3DCap provides an effective solution for 3D shape captioning by combining projected view representations with diffusion models, eliminating the need for additional classifiers while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: The task of 3D shape captioning occupies a significant place within the
domain of computer graphics and has garnered considerable interest in recent
years. Traditional approaches to this challenge frequently depend on the
utilization of costly voxel representations or object detection techniques, yet
often fail to deliver satisfactory outcomes. To address the above challenges,
in this paper, we introduce Diff-3DCap, which employs a sequence of projected
views to represent a 3D object and a continuous diffusion model to facilitate
the captioning process. More precisely, our approach utilizes the continuous
diffusion model to perturb the embedded captions during the forward phase by
introducing Gaussian noise and then predicts the reconstructed annotation
during the reverse phase. Embedded within the diffusion framework is a
commitment to leveraging a visual embedding obtained from a pre-trained
visual-language model, which naturally allows the embedding to serve as a
guiding signal, eliminating the need for an additional classifier. Extensive
results of our experiments indicate that Diff-3DCap can achieve performance
comparable to that of the current state-of-the-art methods.

Models, physics-based renderers); and (2) a fine-tuned stable video diffusion
(SVD) model seamlessly propagates this target illumination throughout the
sequence. To ensure temporal coherence and prevent artifacts, we introduce a
gated cross-attention mechanism for smooth feature blending and a temporal
bootstrapping strategy that harnesses SVD's powerful motion priors. Although
trained on synthetic data, ReLumix shows competitive generalization to
real-world videos. The method demonstrates significant improvements in visual
fidelity, offering a scalable and versatile solution for dynamic lighting
control.

*Jun-Hao Wang,Yi-Yang Tian,Baoquan Chen,Peng-Shuai Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A neural network approach for point cloud visibility determination using 3D U-Net and MLP, achieving significant speedup and accuracy improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visibility determination methods like HPR have limitations in computational efficiency, robustness to noise, and handling concave regions or low-density point clouds.

Method: Formulates visibility as binary classification using 3D U-Net for view-independent features and MLP with view direction input, trained end-to-end with ground-truth labels from rendered 3D models.

Result: Outperforms HPR with up to 126x speedup on large point clouds, robust to noise and varying densities, generalizes well to unseen shapes, validated on ShapeNet, ABC Dataset and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The method provides substantial improvements in visibility accuracy and demonstrates versatility in applications like visualization, surface reconstruction, normal estimation, shadow rendering, and viewpoint optimization.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used representations of 3D data, but determining the
visibility of points from a given viewpoint remains a challenging problem due
to their sparse nature and lack of explicit connectivity. Traditional methods,
such as Hidden Point Removal (HPR), face limitations in computational
efficiency, robustness to noise, and handling concave regions or low-density
point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visibility
determination in point clouds by formulating it as a binary classification
task. The core of our network consists of a 3D U-Net that extracts
view-independent point-wise features and a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
that predicts point visibility using the extracted features and view direction
as inputs. The network is trained end-to-end with ground-truth visibility
labels generated from rendered 3D models. Our method significantly outperforms
HPR in both accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving up to 126 times
speedup on large point clouds. Additionally, our network demonstrates
robustness to noise and varying point cloud densities and generalizes well to
unseen shapes. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive
experiments on the ShapeNet, ABC Dataset and real-world datasets, showing
substantial improvements in visibility accuracy. We also demonstrate the
versatility of our method in various applications, including point cloud
visualization, surface reconstruction, normal estimation, shadow rendering, and
viewpoint optimization. Our code and models are available at

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Light-SQ is a superquadric-based optimization framework for structure-aware 3D shape abstraction that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and editable representations for user-generated content applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for compact, editable 3D representations in user-generated content applications where non-expert users create 3D assets using image-to-3D generative models.

Method: Uses a superquadric-based optimization framework with three key components: SDF carving to reduce primitive overlap, block-regrow-fill strategy guided by volumetric decomposition for structural partitioning, and adaptive residual pruning to prevent over-segmentation. Also supports multiscale fitting for detail preservation.

Result: Extensive experiments show Light-SQ enables efficient, high-fidelity, and editable shape abstraction with superquadrics for complex generated geometry, advancing 3D UGC creation feasibility.

Conclusion: Light-SQ provides a structure-aware solution for primitive-based shape abstraction that effectively compresses high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations suitable for user-generated content scenarios.

Abstract: In user-generated-content (UGC) applications, non-expert users often rely on
image-to-3D generative models to create 3D assets. In this context,
primitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios
by compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations.
Towards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be
structure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware
alignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel
superquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes
structure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to
iteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap
between primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by
structure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to
drive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on
SDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In
addition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement
to preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce
3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both
reconstruction quality and primitive-level editability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Light-SQ enables efficient, high-fidelity, and editable shape
abstraction with superquadrics for complex generated geometry, advancing the
feasibility of 3D UGC creation.

TL;DR: CharGen is a character image editor that combines Concept Sliders for precise attribute control with StreamDiffusion for fast sampling, plus a Repair Step to maintain detail quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interactive character image editing faces challenges in balancing fine-grained control, generation speed, and visual fidelity.

Method: Combines attribute-specific Concept Sliders trained to isolate attributes like facial features and expression with StreamDiffusion sampling pipeline, plus a lightweight Repair Step to restore fine textures.

Result: Achieves 2-4x faster edit turnaround compared to InstructPix2Pix and Google Gemini, with precise editing control and identity-consistent results.

Conclusion: CharGen successfully addresses the trade-off between control, speed, and fidelity in character image editing through its integrated approach.

Abstract: Interactive editing of character images with diffusion models remains
challenging due to the inherent trade-off between fine-grained control,
generation speed, and visual fidelity. We introduce CharGen, a
character-focused editor that combines attribute-specific Concept Sliders,
trained to isolate and manipulate attributes such as facial feature size,
expression, and decoration with the StreamDiffusion sampling pipeline for more
interactive performance. To counteract the loss of detail that often
accompanies accelerated sampling, we propose a lightweight Repair Step that
reinstates fine textures without compromising structural consistency.
Throughout extensive ablation studies and in comparison to open-source
InstructPix2Pix and closed-source Google Gemini, and a comprehensive user
study, CharGen achieves two-to-four-fold faster edit turnaround with precise
editing control and identity-consistent results. Project page:

### [580] [Unsupervised Representation Learning for 3D Mesh Parameterization with Semantic and Visibility Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25094)
*AmirHossein Zamani,Bruno Roy,Arianna Rampini*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: An unsupervised differentiable framework for automatic UV mapping that addresses semantic and visibility awareness to improve texture generation quality and reduce seam artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual UV mapping is a major bottleneck in 3D content creation, and existing automatic methods lack semantic awareness (aligning similar parts across shapes) and visibility awareness (placing seams in occluded regions).

Method: Uses an unsupervised pipeline that segments meshes into semantic parts, applies per-part UV parameterization, aggregates charts into unified UV atlas, and incorporates ambient occlusion-weighted seam objectives to steer cuts toward occluded regions.

Result: Produces UV atlases that better support texture generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully automates mesh parameterization while addressing key perceptual criteria, offering a practical solution to the UV mapping bottleneck in 3D content creation.

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models produce high-quality textures for 3D mesh
objects. However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D
meshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual
task that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry
surveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset
creation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover,
existing automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria:
(1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts
across shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in
regions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate
the mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable
framework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic-
and visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i)
segments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned
per-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts
into a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion
(AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted
seam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting
qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we
show that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture
generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines.

TL;DR: LayerD is a method that decomposes raster graphic designs into editable layers, enabling re-editing of composited images by iteratively extracting unoccluded foreground layers with appearance-based refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Layer-based editing becomes impossible once graphic designs are composited into raster images, limiting creative workflows that require modification of existing designs.

Method: Iteratively extracts unoccluded foreground layers and uses a refinement approach that leverages the uniform appearance assumption of layers in graphic designs.

Result: LayerD achieves high-quality decomposition and outperforms baseline methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The method enables re-editable creative workflows and can be used with modern image generators and layer-based editing tools.

Abstract: Designers craft and edit graphic designs in a layer representation, but
layer-based editing becomes impossible once composited into a raster image. In
this work, we propose LayerD, a method to decompose raster graphic designs into
layers for re-editable creative workflow. LayerD addresses the decomposition
task by iteratively extracting unoccluded foreground layers. We propose a
simple yet effective refinement approach taking advantage of the assumption
that layers often exhibit uniform appearance in graphic designs. As
decomposition is ill-posed and the ground-truth layer structure may not be
reliable, we develop a quality metric that addresses the difficulty. In
experiments, we show that LayerD successfully achieves high-quality
decomposition and outperforms baselines. We also demonstrate the use of LayerD
with state-of-the-art image generators and layer-based editing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis shows RL helps LLMs in planning tasks through exploration, but policy gradient suffers from diversity collapse while Q-learning preserves diversity and enables off-policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical basis for why RL methods enhance LLM planning capabilities, given that their effectiveness remains poorly understood despite practical success.

Method: Using a tractable graph-based abstraction to analyze policy gradient and Q-learning methods, examining exploration, diversity preservation, and reward design issues.

Result: SFT introduces spurious solutions based on co-occurrence, while RL achieves correct planning through exploration. Policy gradient suffers from diversity collapse, but Q-learning preserves diversity and enables off-policy learning.

Conclusion: RL's exploration enables better generalization in planning, Q-learning outperforms policy gradient by preserving diversity, and careful reward design is crucial to prevent reward hacking in practical applications.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of generalizing mechanistic findings across different LLMs by proposing five axes of correspondence and empirically validating them through analysis of 1-back attention heads in Pythia models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks clear principles for determining when mechanistic findings from one LLM generalize to others, creating a fundamental epistemological challenge in mechanistic interpretability research.

Method: Proposed five axes of correspondence (functional, developmental, positional, relational, configurational) and empirically analyzed 1-back attention heads across different pretraining seeds and model sizes of Pythia models (14M to 410M parameters).

Result: Found striking consistency in developmental trajectories of 1-back attention across models, limited positional consistency, and systematic patterns where larger models show earlier onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention.

Conclusion: Progress in mechanistic interpretability requires mapping constitutive design properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms to establish generalizability principles.

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

TL;DR: JE-IRT is a geometric item-response framework that embeds LLMs and questions in a shared space, replacing global rankings with topical specialization and enabling interpretable model evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single scores, obscuring their multidimensional nature and lacking interpretability.

Method: A geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a shared space, where question direction encodes semantics and norm encodes difficulty, with correctness determined by geometric interactions.

Result: Reveals that out-of-distribution behavior can be explained through directional alignment, larger norms indicate harder questions, and the framework naturally supports generalization by adding new LLMs with single embeddings.

Conclusion: JE-IRT establishes a unified and interpretable geometric lens connecting LLM abilities with question structure, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and generalization.

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

*Yu Wu,Shuo Wu,Ye Tao,Yansong Li,Anand D. Sarwate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade is an online, interactive LLM cascade system where strong models teach weak models by distilling solutions into reusable strategies, improving efficiency and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM cascades are non-adaptive and repeatedly consult expensive models for similar queries, leading to high costs. There's a need for more efficient cascading that learns from past interactions.

Method: Extends strong models from backup helpers to teachers that distill solutions into generalized problem-solving strategies. These strategies are added to subsequent queries to boost weak model performance dynamically without fine-tuning.

Result: Significantly improves weak model accuracy (up to 33.06% points) and overall system accuracy (up to 5.53% points), while reducing strong model calls (up to 48.05%) and costs (up to 49.63%) across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade enables effective in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs and provides a scalable framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

TL;DR: Agentless training provides structured skill priors that enable efficient adaptation to SWE-Agent frameworks, bridging workflow and agentic approaches for transferable coding agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that workflow-based Agentless methods and multi-turn SWE-Agent frameworks are not mutually exclusive, and that skill priors from Agentless training can enable effective SWE-Agent adaptation.

Method: Curated Agentless training recipe to develop Kimi-Dev (open-source SWE LLM), then applied additional SFT adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories to power SWE-Agents.

Result: Kimi-Dev achieved 60.4% on SWE-bench Verified (best among workflow approaches) and powered SWE-Agents to 48.6% pass@1, on par with Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Conclusion: Structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge workflow and agentic frameworks, enabling transferable coding agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge

TL;DR: MNPO extends Nash learning from human feedback from 2-player to multiplayer games, addressing limitations of existing methods in capturing complex, non-transitive human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF methods struggle with non-transitive and heterogeneous real-world preferences, and current Nash learning approaches are limited to two-player interactions, creating single-opponent bias.

Method: Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO) formulates alignment as an n-player game where each policy competes against a population of opponents while being regularized toward a reference model.

Result: MNPO consistently outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks, achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: MNPO provides a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex, non-transitive human preferences, establishing well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces p-less sampling, a hyperparameter-free decoding strategy that dynamically sets truncation thresholds based on token probability distributions, outperforming existing methods across various tasks while maintaining quality at higher temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling methods for LLMs are sensitive to hyperparameter choices and their performance varies across different tasks and temperature settings, requiring manual tuning.

Method: Proposes p-less sampling - an information-theoretic approach that dynamically sets truncation thresholds at each decoding step using the entire token probability distribution, eliminating the need for hyperparameters.

Result: P-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches across math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks, with less degradation at higher temperatures and greater inference-time efficiency through lower sampling times and shorter generation lengths.

Conclusion: P-less sampling provides a robust, hyperparameter-free alternative to existing decoding strategies that maintains high-quality outputs across temperature variations while improving efficiency.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Motivation: Prior work on tool-integrated reasoning has mainly focused on when to invoke tools, overlooking how tools are applied. The authors identify that misaligned choices in tool application patterns often cause failures even when reasoning is sound.

Method: A two-stage framework that first builds code competence from two identified patterns (calculator pattern for direct computation and algorithmic pattern for encoding problems as programs), then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences.

Result: Substantial improvements in both code usage and accuracy across challenging math datasets: Code@1 on MATH500 increased from 64.0% to 70.5%, and on AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%.

Conclusion: The pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning is highly effective, as demonstrated by significant performance gains on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a

TL;DR: JET trains Large Reasoning Models to proactively terminate unnecessary reasoning steps, significantly improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy by using trajectory truncation and quality-controlled length rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models incur substantial computational costs due to deep reasoning, and existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to construct short reasoning paths during rollout, limiting effective learning.

Method: Proposes Just-Enough Thinking (JET) which performs trajectory truncation during rollout to expose models to short, distributionally consistent reasoning paths, and uses a quality-controlled length reward to encourage concise reasoning while maintaining correctness.

Result: JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieved 4.6% accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

Conclusion: JET effectively trains models to terminate unnecessary reasoning early, demonstrating that LRMs accumulate sufficient information early in reasoning, making further steps redundant.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

*Siyang Wu,Honglin Bao,Sida Li,Ari Holtzman,James A. Evans*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces benchmark signatures - sets of salient tokens from natural corpora where LLM perplexity predicts benchmark performance, revealing meaningful overlaps and divergences in LLM capabilities across different domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better characterize LLM benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps by developing capacity familiarity signatures that probe the actual capacity required for benchmark performance, addressing limitations in current benchmark agreement studies.

Method: Extracted benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse domains (knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, world modeling), using token perplexity from naturally authored corpora.

Result: Found high overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, while multilingual and cultural benchmarks showed less similarity. Performance overlaps were universally high but influenced by benchmark-orthogonal factors like question format. Coding emerged as the least overlapping domain.

Conclusion: Benchmark signatures provide robust insights into benchmark validity and LLM sensitivities, revealing cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following, and world modeling, while offering mechanistic understanding of interconnected LLM capabilities.

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

TL;DR: PrefCleanBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in LLM alignment, providing standardized assessment of cleaning strategies across diverse datasets, models, and algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback for LLM alignment is often noisy and inconsistent, degrading reward model quality. Current automated data cleaning methods lack systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability.

Method: Introduced PrefCleanBench with standardized protocol to assess 13 cleaning methods across diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms in LLM alignment context.

Result: The benchmark enables rigorous comparison of disparate methods and uncovers key factors determining data cleaning success in alignment tasks.

Conclusion: PrefCleanBench establishes groundwork for principled approaches to improve LLM alignment through better data quality, highlighting the crucial role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development.

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how reasoning traces influence answer generation in Large Reasoning Models, showing that reasoning tokens functionally guide answer generation through attention mechanisms and activation patching experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unclear relationship between explicit reasoning traces and final answer generation in Large Reasoning Models, and determine whether reasoning tokens actually influence the answers produced.

Method: Three-stage investigation: 1) Empirical evaluation of reasoning inclusion effects, 2) Attention analysis identifying Reasoning-Focus Heads, 3) Mechanistic interventions using activation patching to test reasoning-answer dependence.

Result: Including reasoning improves answer quality; answer tokens attend heavily to reasoning tokens; perturbations to key reasoning tokens reliably alter final answers, confirming directional information flow from reasoning to answer.

Conclusion: Reasoning tokens play a functional role in shaping model outputs, with a clear directional flow of information from reasoning to answer generation in Large Reasoning Models.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Search agents connecting LLMs to the Internet face safety threats from unreliable search results. The paper introduces SafeSearch benchmark and automated red-teaming framework to assess vulnerabilities, revealing up to 90.5% attack success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unreliable search results pose safety threats to LLM-based search agents, creating a new threat surface that needs systematic assessment.

Method: Developed automated red-teaming framework and SafeSearch benchmark with 300 test cases covering 5 risk categories. Evaluated 3 search agent scaffolds across 15 LLMs (7 proprietary, 8 open-source).

Result: Found substantial vulnerabilities - highest attack success rate reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini. Common defenses like reminder prompting showed limited effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework provides systematic safety assessment for search agents, highlighting the need for transparency in safer agent development.

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases

*Cheng Yang,Jiaxuan Lu,Haiyuan Wan,Junchi Yu,Feiwei Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemMAS is a multi-agent system that provides explainable reaction condition recommendations through evidence-based reasoning, outperforming existing methods while offering interpretable justifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods for chemical reaction condition recommendation lack explanation of their rationale, limiting their utility in scientific workflows where trust and interpretability are crucial.

Method: ChemMAS decomposes condition prediction into four stages: mechanistic grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale aggregation, with each decision backed by chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents.

Result: ChemMAS achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy.

Conclusion: ChemMAS establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI in scientific discovery by providing falsifiable, human-trustable rationales for reaction condition recommendations.

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

*Guanxu Chen,Yafu Li,Yuxian Jiang,Chen Qian,Qihan Ren,Jingyi Yang,Yu Cheng,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CANON is a new reinforcement learning method that amplifies target metrics without assuming direction, outperforming prior methods on math reasoning and logic tasks while improving token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RL methods for LLMs use directional priors through reward shaping, which can be overly biased and lead to failure without careful hyperparameter tuning.

Method: CANON regroups sampled responses into two groups based on target metric values, measures which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group comparison, and identifies better responses within groups.

Result: CANON consistently outperforms prior methods across three LLMs on math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks, and improves token efficiency when applied to response length.

Conclusion: CANON effectively amplifies target metrics without directional assumptions, achieving better performance and more favorable performance-cost trade-offs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Single-run LLM evaluations are unreliable - using 2-3 independent runs significantly improves ranking stability while remaining practical for most teams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM leaderboards rely on single stochastic runs, but the reliability of such evaluations and how many repetitions are needed for robust conclusions is unclear.

Method: Re-evaluated 8 state-of-the-art models on AI4Math Benchmark with 3 independent runs per setting, using mixed-effects logistic regression, domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run reliability assessment.

Result: Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 83% of slices invert at least one pairwise rank compared to three-run majority. Two runs remove ~83% of single-run inversions. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage (~5%) but large ranking gains.

Conclusion: Practitioners should treat evaluation as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use ≥2 repetitions under stochastic decoding to improve robustness while remaining feasible for small teams.

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

*Yuhui Wang,Changjiang Li,Guangke Chen,Jiacheng Liang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large reasoning models exhibit inconsistency between their reasoning traces and final answers due to competing mechanisms of CoT reasoning and memory retrieval, which can be exploited as shortcuts during fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LRMs' final answers often contradict their own reasoning traces and address the limitation in current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms where models exploit retrieval mechanisms as shortcuts.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments with misleading cues during reasoning and corrupted answers during retrieval, then developed FARL - a fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning to suppress retrieval shortcuts.

Result: Confirmed both CoT reasoning and memory retrieval mechanisms operate simultaneously, with their dominance influenced by problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches. FARL successfully promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The study reveals a critical limitation in current reasoning fine-tuning and proposes FARL as an effective solution to suppress retrieval shortcuts and promote genuine reasoning development in large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

*Yixin He,Lumingyuan Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FR-Ponder is a framework that adaptively allocates reasoning compute for LLMs by using a small controller to decide when to halt or apply ponder steps via latent steering vectors, achieving better compute-accuracy trade-offs without modifying backbone weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting use uniform compute depth across all inputs, which wastes computation on simple queries and under-thinks complex ones, highlighting the need for instance-adaptive reasoning compute.

Method: A <1M-parameter controller observes hidden states to decide whether to halt or apply ponder steps by adding pre-computed steering vectors to frozen representations. Uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adaptively regulate reasoning depth and curriculum learning for calibrated compute allocation.

Result: On GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks, FR-Ponder improves the compute-accuracy frontier, achieving lower FLOPs with comparable or better accuracy than early-exit baselines, while learned compute allocation correlates with problem difficulty.

Conclusion: FR-Ponder enables instance-adaptive reasoning compute through latent steering, providing an effective approach to balance performance and computational cost without modifying backbone LLM weights, with interpretable steering directions and difficulty-correlated compute allocation.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

TL;DR: SpecExit is a novel framework that uses hidden states from a lightweight draft model to predict both future tokens and early-exit signals, reducing generation length by 66% and achieving 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs with high latency, limiting real-world deployment. Existing early-exit mechanisms have detection overhead that limits latency gains and generalizability.

Method: Proposes SpecExit framework that uses hidden states from a lightweight draft model to predict future tokens and early-exit signals simultaneously, eliminating probing overhead.

Result: Reduces average generation length by 66%, achieves 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to speculative decoding baseline, without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Hidden states provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of hidden states for efficient reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

Motivation: Traditional mobile message design has limitations in exploring high-dimensional design spaces for healthcare communication, which is critical for improving medication adherence and healthy behaviors.

Method: PAME-AI uses a system of specialized computational agents based on the DIKW hierarchy to transform raw experimental data into actionable message design strategies through parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous learning.

Conclusion: The agentic architecture enables effective large-scale healthcare communication optimization, making it suitable for improving patient engagement through data-driven messaging design.

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental

TL;DR: AdvChain is an alignment method that addresses the snowball effect in Chain-of-Thought reasoning by teaching models dynamic self-correction through adversarial tuning, improving safety without compromising reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety CoT tuning methods suffer from the snowball effect where minor reasoning deviations amplify throughout the thought process, leading to harmful compliance or excessive refusal.

Method: AdvChain uses adversarial CoT tuning with Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples to teach models dynamic self-correction and recovery from harmful reasoning drifts.

Result: AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while reducing over-refusal on benign prompts, achieving superior safety-utility balance.

Conclusion: The work establishes a new direction for building more robust and reliable reasoning models through dynamic self-correction mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in verifying LLM-generated scientific answers by creating SCI-VerifyBench benchmark and SCI-Verifier model, focusing on cross-disciplinary coverage and reasoning-based verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verification methods for scientific LLM outputs lack systematic standards, have limited disciplinary coverage, and rely on inefficient rule-based approaches that don't generalize well across domains.

Method: Two-pronged approach: (1) Build SCI-VerifyBench benchmark from real LLM responses with domain-specific equivalence transformations and expert annotations; (2) Develop SCI-Verifier, a reasoning-augmented verifier trained to handle logical reasoning and equivalence judgments.

Result: The proposed framework provides systematic evaluation standards and practical verification capabilities, demonstrating strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment while maintaining stable outputs.

Conclusion: SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier together offer a principled framework to enhance LLM reliability in scientific domains through comprehensive evaluation and reasoning-based verification.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

Motivation: Existing methods overlook the safety of chain-of-thought reasoning itself, allowing harmful content to persist even when final responses appear safe, which undermines trustworthiness and poses risks if exploited by malicious users.

Method: Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO) - an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs for preference learning with strong signals.

Result: IPO remarkably improves overall safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning safety and provide a practical path to safer Large Reasoning Models through process supervision and intervention-based preference optimization.

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

*Yihong Liu,Junyi Li,Wayne Xin Zhao,Hongyu Lu,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoPH is a novel framework that co-evolves prompts and heuristic algorithms using LLMs, integrating island migration and elite selection to avoid local optima in automatic algorithm design for combinatorial optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic algorithms require extensive domain expertise and implementation effort, while existing LLM-based approaches risk stagnating in local optima during automatic heuristics design.

Method: EvoPH integrates island migration model with elite selection algorithm to simulate diverse heuristics populations, co-evolving prompts and heuristic algorithms guided by performance feedback.

Result: EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error against optimal solutions on Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem datasets.

Conclusion: EvoPH advances the field of automatic algorithm design with LLMs by effectively avoiding local optima through co-evolution of prompts and heuristics.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

### [606] [On the Self-awareness of Large Reasoning Models' Capability Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24711)
*Qingjie Zhang,Yujia Fu,Yang Wang,Liu Yan,Tao Wei,Ke Xu,Minlie Huang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRMs often waste computation on unsolvable problems. The paper shows LRMs have self-awareness of capability boundaries through confidence patterns and hidden states, enabling optimization strategies that reduce token usage by 62.7-93.6% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs engage in unproductive reasoning on hard questions until context limits, wasting computation and producing wrong answers. The paper investigates whether LRMs have self-awareness of their capability boundaries to address this fundamental issue.

Method: For black-box models: analyze reasoning confidence trajectories. For white-box models: examine hidden states of last input token. Propose two monitoring strategies: reasoning expression monitoring and hidden states monitoring.

Result: Found that solvable problems show accelerated growing confidence trajectory while unsolvable ones show convergent uncertainty. Hidden states encode boundary information, making solvable/unsolvable problems linearly separable before reasoning begins. Boundary-aware strategies cut token usage by 62.7-93.6% without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries through both reasoning expressions and hidden states. Simple monitoring strategies can significantly improve reliability and efficiency by avoiding unproductive reasoning on unsolvable problems.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI) to measure logical reasoning complexity in training data and proposes a re-cognizing optimization strategy to enhance LLM reasoning performance by aligning data complexity with model capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches focus on data format transformation but neglect internal reasoning complexity, leaving reasoning potential underutilized. LLM reasoning is constrained by both data potential and model cognitive capacity.

Method: Introduces Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI) metric to quantify logical reasoning complexity by decomposing logical structures. Proposes re-cognizing optimization strategy to enhance reasoning intensity of training data by aligning with LLM's reasoning boundary.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant performance and generalization improvements over data-centric strategies. Method validated under reinforcement learning framework.

Conclusion: Prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than scale or format is essential for realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

TL;DR: SQuID enables neural embeddings to recover latent psychometric dimensions from survey items, achieving 55% variance explanation compared to human data without domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a cost-effective, scalable method that can replicate psychometric structures traditionally obtained through extensive human surveys, addressing the challenge of negative correlations between dimensions.

Method: Uses SQuID (Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings Differentials) with large language model embeddings to recover human values structure from PVQ-RR, comparing multiple embedding models across various evaluation metrics.

Result: Explains 55% of variance in dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data, shows fair factor congruence coefficients, and successfully recovers theoretical structure without requiring negative correlation constraints.

Conclusion: Semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric structures with comparable quality to traditional methods, offering advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility for psychometrics and social science research.

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

TL;DR: MASLegalBench is a legal benchmark for multi-agent systems using GDPR scenarios, designed to evaluate task decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training in legal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous legal benchmarks for LLM agents don't leverage MAS advantages like task decomposition and agent specialization, limiting MAS potential in legal domain.

Method: Proposed MASLegalBench with GDPR scenarios, manually designed role-based MAS, and conducted experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Results reveal strengths, limitations, and improvement areas for existing models and MAS architectures in legal reasoning.

Conclusion: MASLegalBench enables better evaluation of multi-agent systems in legal domain, highlighting their potential for complex legal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

### [610] [From $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to $f(g(x))$: LLMs Learn New Skills in RL by Composing Old Ones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25123)
*Lifan Yuan,Weize Chen,Yuchen Zhang,Ganqu Cui,Hanbin Wang,Ziming You,Ning Ding,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun,Hao Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL enables LLMs to acquire genuinely new compositional skills by combining existing atomic skills, rather than just reweighting existing knowledge. This compositional learning transfers across tasks and fundamentally changes model reasoning behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the debate about whether RL teaches LLMs genuinely new skills or merely activates existing ones, and to understand if LLMs can acquire compositional cognitive skills similar to humans.

Method: Developed a synthetic framework using string transformation functions, where skills are defined as ability to infer outputs. Tested RL's ability to teach unseen compositions h(x)=g(f(x)) when models already know atomic functions f and g.

Result: RL enabled LLMs to learn unseen function compositions and generalize to compositions of >2 functions. Compositional skills transferred to different target tasks without compositional training on target. RL fundamentally changed reasoning behaviors, while next-token training with same data showed none of these effects.

Conclusion: RL can teach LLMs genuinely new compositional skills that transfer across tasks, suggesting value in building base models with basic skills then using RL to develop advanced, generalizable skills for complex problems.

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

TL;DR: RLHI learns from natural human conversations using two methods: User-Guided Rewrites that revise model outputs based on follow-up responses, and User-Based Rewards that personalize learning using long-term interaction history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational models rely on pre-annotated expert feedback, but future models need to learn from natural human interaction for continual improvement and multifaceted alignment.

Method: Two complementary RLHI methods: (1) User-Guided Rewrites that revise unsatisfactory outputs based on users' natural-language follow-up responses, (2) User-Based Rewards that learn via persona-conditioned reward models using long-term interaction history.

Result: Both RLHI variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and instruction-following on WildChat conversations, with similar feedback improving reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Organic human interaction provides scalable and effective supervision for personalized alignment of conversational models.

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

TL;DR: ReasoningBank is a memory framework that enables LLM agents to learn from past experiences by distilling reasoning strategies from both successful and failed interactions, allowing continuous improvement over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents fail to learn from accumulated interaction history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors, limiting their effectiveness in persistent real-world roles.

Method: Proposes ReasoningBank memory framework that distills generalizable reasoning strategies from self-judged experiences, and introduces memory-aware test-time scaling (MaTTS) to accelerate learning by scaling interaction experience and generating diverse experiences for better memory synthesis.

Result: ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks, improving both effectiveness and efficiency. MaTTS further amplifies these gains.

Conclusion: Memory-driven experience scaling establishes a new scaling dimension that enables agents to self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arising from continuous learning.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual reasoning methods focus on specific reasoning modes and struggle with general reasoning capabilities, limiting their adaptability across different domains.

Method: Two-stage AdaVaR framework: supervised cold-start stage for unifying different reasoning modes, followed by RL process with AdaGRPO algorithm for inducing mode selection capability based on context.

Result: Extensive experiments show effective learning and differentiation of multiple reasoning modes, context-adaptive mode selection, and consistent improvement across various scenarios.

Conclusion: MoVT is an effective solution for building general visual reasoning models that can adaptively select appropriate reasoning modes based on context.

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

*Junyang Zhang,Tianyi Zhu,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Attention Anchor is a parameter-free framework that improves cross-modal alignment in vision-language models by grouping semantically similar tokens across modalities, reducing hallucinations and improving performance on various benchmarks with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs underperform and hallucinate due to direct concatenation of image and text tokens with modality-blinded positional encoding, which creates unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related cross-modal tokens.

Method: Proposes Attention Anchor framework that inserts text tokens near relevant visual patches to create semantic signposts, enabling better cross-modal attention by grouping semantically similar tokens across modalities.

Result: Achieves improvements across 13 out of 15 metrics, with up to 32% gains on reasoning tasks and 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks. Enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform larger models like LLaVA 7B with only 0.1% inference time overhead.

Conclusion: Attention Anchor efficiently enhances cross-modal locality and alignment without disrupting semantic flow, representing one of the first investigations into mixed-modal token grouping where text and image tokens are clustered jointly.

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores Vision-Language Process Reward Models (VL-PRMs) for improving reasoning in Vision Language Models, introducing hybrid data synthesis, perception-focused supervision, and systematic test-time scaling strategies across multiple multimodal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language PRMs rely on noisy Monte Carlo Tree Search for data construction and have limited generalization across tasks, motivating the need for better VL-PRM design and evaluation.

Method: Proposes hybrid data synthesis combining MCTS with strong VLM judgments, perception-focused supervision for visual grounding error detection, and systematic evaluation of test-time scaling strategies.

Result: VL-PRMs outperform process step selection when used as Outcome Reward Models, smaller VL-PRMs can match larger ones in error detection, perception supervision improves test-time scaling, and TTS performance improves on advanced math reasoning without specific training.

Conclusion: The work provides key insights for VL-PRM design and motivates further research to advance Vision Language Models through improved reasoning reliability.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based planners struggle with effective guidance in reactive, closed-loop environments, and current anchor-based approaches rely on truncated schedules that introduce theoretical inconsistencies and performance compromises.

Method: Introduces a principled diffusion framework that translates expert driving anchors into trajectory plans, compatible with efficient ODE solvers for real-time deployment, and appropriately responds to varying traffic conditions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Bench2Drive benchmark with 5% improvement in success rate over prior methods.

Conclusion: BridgeDrive provides an effective solution for guiding diffusion models in complex driving scenarios while maintaining theoretical soundness and real-time efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

Motivation: To address the challenge of producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts in visual AI, particularly for interpretable decision-making.

Method: Uses object-centric representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process with game-theoretic negotiation to generate coherent and discriminative evidence.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art black-box models on two diagnostic multi-object datasets, with user studies showing OCEAN's explanations are rated more intuitive and trustworthy than GradCAM and LIME.

Conclusion: OCEAN provides a faithful and interpretable decision-making framework that bridges the gap between performance and explainability in visual AI systems.

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is
producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle
this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric

game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and
discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable
decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against

*Yue Zhang,Tianyi Ma,Zun Wang,Yanyuan Qiao,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using multi-perspective textual descriptions to enhance LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation agents through analogical reasoning, improving scene understanding and navigation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot LLM-based VLN agents either oversimplify visual details by encoding images as text or fail to capture abstract semantics needed for high-level reasoning when processing raw images.

Method: Incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives to facilitate analogical reasoning across images, enhancing global scene understanding and spatial reasoning.

Result: Experiments on the R2R dataset demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Multi-perspective textual descriptions with analogical reasoning effectively improve LLM-based navigation agents' contextual understanding and action decision accuracy.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

### [619] [PARROT: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs in Cross-System SQL Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23338)
*Wei Zhou,Guoliang Li,Haoyu Wang,Yuxing Han,Xufei Wu,Fan Wu,Xuanhe Zhou*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: PARROT is a benchmark for cross-system SQL translation covering 22 database systems with 598 challenging translation pairs, addressing limitations of existing SQL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SQL benchmarks are inadequate for SQL-to-SQL evaluation as they focus on limited database systems (often just SQLite) and cannot capture system-specific SQL dialects like customized functions, data types, and syntax rules.

Method: Created PARROT benchmark comprising 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world business services, with additional variants PARROT-Diverse (28,003 translations) and PARROT-Simple (5,306 samples).

Result: Current LLMs achieve low accuracy (below 38.53% on average) on PARROT, demonstrating the benchmark's challenging nature for system-specific SQL understanding.

Conclusion: PARROT provides a practical and realistic benchmark for cross-system SQL translation research, with public leaderboard and source code available to promote future work in this underexplored area.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMS) have shown increasing effectiveness in
Text-to-SQL tasks. However, another closely related problem, Cross-System SQL
Translation (a.k.a., SQL-to-SQL), which adapts a query written for one database
system (e.g., MySQL) into its equivalent one for another system (e.g.,
ClickHouse), is of great practical importance but remains underexplored.
Existing SQL benchmarks are not well-suited for SQL-to-SQL evaluation, which
(1) focus on a limited set of database systems (often just SQLite) and (2)
cannot capture many system-specific SQL dialects (e.g., customized functions,
data types, and syntax rules). Thus, in this paper, we introduce PARROT, a
Practical And Realistic BenchmaRk for CrOss-System SQL Translation. PARROT
comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world
business services, specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL
understanding (e.g., LLMS achieve lower than 38.53% accuracy on average). We
also provide multiple benchmark variants, including PARROT-Diverse with 28,003
translations (for extensive syntax testing) and PARROT-Simple with 5,306
representative samples (for focused stress testing), covering 22
production-grade database systems. To promote future research, we release a
public leaderboard and source code at: https://code4db.github.io/parrot-bench/.

### [620] [Virus Infection Attack on LLMs: Your Poisoning Can Spread "VIA" Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23041)
*Zi Liang,Qingqing Ye,Xuan Liu,Yanyun Wang,Jianliang Xu,Haibo Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates security risks in synthetic data training for LLMs, revealing strong resistance to existing attacks but introducing VIA - a novel virus-inspired attack that successfully propagates poisoning through synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate the security risks of synthetic-data-integrated training for LLMs, as synthetic data is widely adopted but its potential security vulnerabilities remain uninvestigated.

Method: Introduces Virus Infection Attack (VIA), a novel attack framework that conceals poisoning payloads within protective shells and strategically searches for optimal hijacking points in benign samples to maximize malicious content generation.

Result: VIA significantly increases poisoning content in synthetic data and raises attack success rates to levels comparable to poisoned upstream models, demonstrating that synthetic data training is vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.

Conclusion: The synthetic-data-integrated training paradigm exhibits strong resistance to existing attacks but is vulnerable to the proposed VIA framework, highlighting significant security risks that need to be addressed in LLM development.

Abstract: Synthetic data refers to artificial samples generated by models. While it has
been validated to significantly enhance the performance of large language
models (LLMs) during training and has been widely adopted in LLM development,
potential security risks it may introduce remain uninvestigated. This paper
systematically evaluates the resilience of synthetic-data-integrated training
paradigm for LLMs against mainstream poisoning and backdoor attacks. We reveal
that such a paradigm exhibits strong resistance to existing attacks, primarily
thanks to the different distribution patterns between poisoning data and
queries used to generate synthetic samples. To enhance the effectiveness of
these attacks and further investigate the security risks introduced by
synthetic data, we introduce a novel and universal attack framework, namely,
Virus Infection Attack (VIA), which enables the propagation of current attacks
through synthetic data even under purely clean queries. Inspired by the
principles of virus design in cybersecurity, VIA conceals the poisoning payload
within a protective "shell" and strategically searches for optimal hijacking
points in benign samples to maximize the likelihood of generating malicious
content. Extensive experiments on both data poisoning and backdoor attacks show
that VIA significantly increases the presence of poisoning content in synthetic
data and correspondingly raises the attack success rate (ASR) on downstream
models to levels comparable to those observed in the poisoned upstream models.

### [621] [MaskSQL: Safeguarding Privacy for LLM-Based Text-to-SQL via Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23459)
*Sepideh Abedini,Shubhankar Mohapatra,D. B. Emerson,Masoumeh Shafieinejad,Jesse C. Cresswell,Xi He*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MaskSQL is a privacy-preserving text-to-SQL framework that uses abstraction to mask sensitive information in LLM prompts, achieving performance close to state-of-the-art LLM models while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns and regulatory compliance issues when using proprietary LLMs for text-to-SQL tasks, as current approaches either require sharing sensitive data with third parties or use SLMs that underperform on complex tasks.

Method: Uses abstraction as a privacy protection mechanism to mask sensitive information in LLM prompts, retaining essential information while discarding unnecessary details, unlike redaction or generalization approaches.

Result: Outperforms leading SLM-based text-to-SQL models and achieves performance approaching state-of-the-art LLM-based models while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: MaskSQL provides an effective privacy-utility balance for text-to-SQL tasks and enables broader adoption across use cases by controlling the privacy-utility tradeoff.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on tasks that
require reasoning, such as text-to-SQL, code generation, and debugging.
However, regulatory frameworks with strict privacy requirements constrain their
integration into sensitive systems. State-of-the-art LLMs are also proprietary,
costly, and resource-intensive, making local deployment impractical.
Consequently, utilizing such LLMs often requires sharing data with third-party
providers, raising privacy concerns and risking noncompliance with regulations.
Although fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) can outperform LLMs on certain
tasks and be deployed locally to mitigate privacy concerns, they underperform
on more complex tasks such as text-to-SQL translation. In this work, we
introduce MaskSQL, a text-to-SQL framework that utilizes abstraction as a
privacy protection mechanism to mask sensitive information in LLM prompts.
Unlike redaction, which removes content entirely, or generalization, which
broadens tokens, abstraction retains essential information while discarding
unnecessary details, striking an effective privacy-utility balance for the
text-to-SQL task. Moreover, by providing mechanisms to control the
privacy-utility tradeoff, MaskSQL facilitates adoption across a broader range
of use cases. Our experimental results show that MaskSQL outperforms leading
SLM-based text-to-SQL models and achieves performance approaching
state-of-the-art LLM-based models, while preserving privacy.

*Yixu Wang,Yan Teng,Yingchun Wang,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces LoRA extraction attacks on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuned models and proposes StolenLoRA, a method that uses synthetic data and disagreement-based learning to extract LoRA-adapted models with high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The compactness of LoRA adaptations in vision models creates new security vulnerabilities, particularly model extraction attacks, which haven't been adequately addressed for PEFT methods.

Method: StolenLoRA trains a substitute model using synthetic data generated via LLM prompts and employs Disagreement-based Semi-supervised Learning (DSL) to maximize information from limited queries, even in cross-backbone scenarios.

Result: StolenLoRA achieves up to 96.60% attack success rate with only 10k queries, demonstrating high effectiveness in extracting LoRA-adapted models across different pre-trained backbones.

Conclusion: LoRA-adapted models are specifically vulnerable to extraction attacks, highlighting the urgent need for tailored defense mechanisms, with preliminary defense strategies based on diversified LoRA deployments showing potential.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA have transformed
vision model adaptation, enabling the rapid deployment of customized models.
However, the compactness of LoRA adaptations introduces new safety concerns,
particularly their vulnerability to model extraction attacks. This paper
introduces a new focus of model extraction attacks named LoRA extraction that
extracts LoRA-adaptive models based on a public pre-trained model. We then
propose a novel extraction method called StolenLoRA which trains a substitute
model to extract the functionality of a LoRA-adapted model using synthetic
data. StolenLoRA leverages a Large Language Model to craft effective prompts
for data generation, and it incorporates a Disagreement-based Semi-supervised
Learning (DSL) strategy to maximize information gain from limited queries. Our
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of StolenLoRA, achieving up to a
96.60% attack success rate with only 10k queries, even in cross-backbone
scenarios where the attacker and victim models utilize different pre-trained
backbones. These findings reveal the specific vulnerability of LoRA-adapted
models to this type of extraction and underscore the urgent need for robust
defense mechanisms tailored to PEFT methods. We also explore a preliminary
defense strategy based on diversified LoRA deployments, highlighting its
potential to mitigate such attacks.

### [624] [Taught Well Learned Ill: Towards Distillation-conditional Backdoor Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23871)
*Yukun Chen,Boheng Li,Yu Yuan,Leyi Qi,Yiming Li,Tianwei Zhang,Zhan Qin,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces distillation-conditional backdoor attacks (DCBAs), a novel threat where dormant backdoors in teacher models become activated in student models during knowledge distillation, even with clean datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose a critical vulnerability in knowledge distillation where third-party teacher models with verified security can still contain undetectable backdoors that activate in student models during the distillation process.

Method: Proposes SCAR method that formulates DCBA as a bilevel optimization problem: inner optimization simulates KD process with surrogate student, outer optimization uses surrogate outputs to implant conditional backdoors in teacher model using implicit differentiation with pre-optimized trigger injection.

Result: Extensive experiments show SCAR is effective across diverse datasets, model architectures, and KD techniques, and resists existing backdoor detection methods.

Conclusion: Reveals a significant and previously overlooked vulnerability in knowledge distillation process that enables stealthy backdoor attacks through the teacher-student transfer mechanism.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a vital technique for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices by transferring knowledge from
large teacher models to lightweight student models. While teacher models from
third-party platforms may undergo security verification (\eg, backdoor
detection), we uncover a novel and critical threat: distillation-conditional
backdoor attacks (DCBAs). DCBA injects dormant and undetectable backdoors into
teacher models, which become activated in student models via the KD process,
even with clean distillation datasets. While the direct extension of existing
methods is ineffective for DCBA, we implement this attack by formulating it as
a bilevel optimization problem and proposing a simple yet effective method
(\ie, SCAR). Specifically, the inner optimization simulates the KD process by
optimizing a surrogate student model, while the outer optimization leverages
outputs from this surrogate to optimize the teacher model for implanting the
conditional backdoor. Our SCAR addresses this complex optimization utilizing an
implicit differentiation algorithm with a pre-optimized trigger injection
function. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model architectures,
and KD techniques validate the effectiveness of our SCAR and its resistance
against existing backdoor detection, highlighting a significant yet previously
overlooked vulnerability in the KD process. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A high-payload image watermarking method that embeds semantic text descriptions into images using orthogonal/turbo codes, frequency-domain embedding, and perceptual masking for robustness and imperceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To embed semantic descriptions of images (including text prompts) as watermarks in AI-generated images, enabling detection of semantic modifications through text-image mismatch analysis.

Method: Builds on traditional watermarking with orthogonal and turbo codes for robustness, combined with frequency-domain embedding and perceptual masking techniques for imperceptibility in large-scale images.

Result: Extremely robust against various image processing operations, including traditional and AI inpainting, allowing retrieval of embedded text even after modifications.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables semantic watermarking that can detect image modifications through text-image mismatch analysis, providing a reliable way to track semantic changes in AI-generated images.

Abstract: We propose a high-payload image watermarking method for textual embedding,
where a semantic description of the image - which may also correspond to the
input text prompt-, is embedded inside the image. In order to be able to
robustly embed high payloads in large-scale images - such as those produced by
modern AI generators - the proposed approach builds upon a traditional
watermarking scheme that exploits orthogonal and turbo codes for improved
robustness, and integrates frequency-domain embedding and perceptual masking
techniques to enhance watermark imperceptibility. Experiments show that the
proposed method is extremely robust against a wide variety of image processing,
and the embedded text can be retrieved also after traditional and AI
inpainting, permitting to unveil the semantic modification the image has
undergone via image-text mismatch analysis.

Motivation: To examine how textual content in earnings press releases can predict stock returns and compare traditional bag-of-words approaches with modern BERT-based embeddings.

Method: Analyzed over 138,000 press releases from 2005-2023 using bag-of-words and BERT-based embeddings (FinBERT), combining models for enhanced performance, and conducting topic analysis.

Result: Press release content is as informative as earnings surprise, with FinBERT having highest predictive power. Stock prices fully reflect press release content at market open. Leaked releases offer predictive advantage. Topic analysis reveals managerial self-serving bias.

Conclusion: The framework supports real-time return prediction through online learning integration, provides interpretability, and reveals language's nuanced role in price formation.

Abstract: We examine how textual features in earnings press releases predict stock
returns on earnings announcement days. Using over 138,000 press releases from
2005 to 2023, we compare traditional bag-of-words and BERT-based embeddings. We
find that press release content (soft information) is as informative as
earnings surprise (hard information), with FinBERT yielding the highest
predictive power. Combining models enhances explanatory strength and
interpretability of the content of press releases. Stock prices fully reflect
the content of press releases at market open. If press releases are leaked, it
offers predictive advantage. Topic analysis reveals self-serving bias in
managerial narratives. Our framework supports real-time return prediction

TL;DR: ReSeFlow combines SE(3)-equivariant diffusion models with rectified flows to enable fast, geodesic-consistent policy generation for robotic manipulation with only one inference step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires robust long-horizon trajectory policies that are data-efficient and generalize well under rigid-body motions, but existing SE(3)-equivariant diffusion models suffer from slow inference times.

Method: Proposed ReSeFlow (Rectifying SE(3)-Equivariant Policy Learning Flows) that applies rectification to SE(3)-diffusion models using SE(3)-equivariant networks to preserve rotational and translational symmetry.

Result: ReSeFlow with only one inference step achieves better performance than baseline methods with 100-step inference, reducing error by 48.5% on painting task and 21.9% on rotating triangle task, with lower geodesic distance.

Conclusion: The method successfully combines SE(3) equivariance and rectified flow advantages, enabling data-efficient and inference-efficient generative policy learning suitable for real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires the generation of
robust and long-horizon trajectory-level policy with conditions of perceptual
observations and benefits from the advantages of SE(3)-equivariant diffusion
models that are data-efficient. However, these models suffer from the inference
time costs. Inspired by the inference efficiency of rectified flows, we
introduce the rectification to the SE(3)-diffusion models and propose the
ReSeFlow, i.e., Rectifying SE(3)-Equivariant Policy Learning Flows, providing
fast, geodesic-consistent, least-computational policy generation. Crucially,
both components employ SE(3)-equivariant networks to preserve rotational and
translational symmetry, enabling robust generalization under rigid-body
motions. With the verification on the simulated benchmarks, we find that the
proposed ReSeFlow with only one inference step can achieve better performance
with lower geodesic distance than the baseline methods, achieving up to a 48.5%
error reduction on the painting task and a 21.9% reduction on the rotating
triangle task compared to the baseline's 100-step inference. This method takes
advantages of both SE(3) equivariance and rectified flow and puts it forward
for the real-world application of generative policy learning models with the
data and inference efficiency.

Motivation: Data scarcity in robot learning compared to abundant human motion capture data and internet resources.

Method: Compositional prototype discovery with soft assignments and adaptive prototype selection strategy.

Conclusion: UniPrototype bridges the gap between human and robot manipulation capabilities through effective knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Data scarcity remains a fundamental challenge in robot learning. While human
demonstrations benefit from abundant motion capture data and vast internet
resources, robotic manipulation suffers from limited training examples. To
bridge this gap between human and robot manipulation capabilities, we propose
UniPrototype, a novel framework that enables effective knowledge transfer from
human to robot domains via shared motion primitives. ur approach makes three
key contributions: (1) We introduce a compositional prototype discovery
mechanism with soft assignments, enabling multiple primitives to co-activate
and thus capture blended and hierarchical skills; (2) We propose an adaptive
prototype selection strategy that automatically adjusts the number of
prototypes to match task complexity, ensuring scalable and efficient
representation; (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through
extensive experiments in both simulation environments and real-world robotic
systems. Our results show that UniPrototype successfully transfers human
manipulation knowledge to robots, significantly improving learning efficiency
and task performance compared to existing approaches.The code and dataset will

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A2C2 is a lightweight real-time correction module that improves reactivity of Vision-Language-Action models by adding time-aware corrections to action chunks without retraining the base policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models use action chunking for efficiency but this harms reactivity under inference delay and long horizons, limiting real-time deployment.

Method: Adds a lightweight correction head that runs every control step, combining latest observation, predicted action, positional features, and base policy features to output per-step corrections.

Result: Consistent success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23% and +7% respectively vs RTC), improves robustness for long horizons even with zero delay.

Conclusion: A2C2 is an effective plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in real-time control with minimal overhead.

Abstract: To improve efficiency and temporal coherence, Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models often predict action chunks; however, this action chunking harms
reactivity under inference delay and long horizons. We introduce Asynchronous
Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk
correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction
to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest
observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature
that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features
from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the
base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The
approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to
asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic
Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent
success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23%
point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves
robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the
correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the
inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an
effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in
real-time control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAVEN is a 3D memory-based behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor environments, combining semantic voxel-ray mapping, long-horizon planning, and vision-language model cues to overcome limitations of reactive policies and offline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic navigation methods are limited to indoor settings with constrained spatial ranges and structured layouts, while outdoor approaches either use reactive policies that produce short-sighted behaviors or rely on precomputed scene graphs that lack adaptability for online deployment.

Method: RAVEN uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as persistent memory, combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search for scalability, leverages a large vision-language model for auxiliary cues, and coordinates these components through a behavior tree that adaptively switches behaviors.

Result: RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation across 10 photorealistic outdoor environments over 100 semantic tasks, and demonstrates real-world applicability through successful deployment on an aerial robot in outdoor field tests.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of long-range outdoor semantic navigation by combining persistent 3D memory, scalable search strategies, and adaptive behavior coordination, enabling robust performance in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Aerial outdoor semantic navigation requires robots to explore large,
unstructured environments to locate target objects. Recent advances in semantic
navigation have demonstrated open-set object-goal navigation in indoor
settings, but these methods remain limited by constrained spatial ranges and
structured layouts, making them unsuitable for long-range outdoor search. While
outdoor semantic navigation approaches exist, they either rely on reactive
policies based on current observations, which tend to produce short-sighted
behaviors, or precompute scene graphs offline for navigation, limiting
adaptability to online deployment. We present RAVEN, a 3D memory-based,
behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor
environments. It (1) uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as
persistent memory, enabling long-horizon planning and avoiding purely reactive
behaviors, (2) combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search to
scale to large environments, (3) leverages a large vision-language model to
suggest auxiliary cues, mitigating sparsity of outdoor targets. These
components are coordinated by a behavior tree, which adaptively switches
behaviors for robust operation. We evaluate RAVEN in 10 photorealistic outdoor
simulation environments over 100 semantic tasks, encompassing single-object
search, multi-class, multi-instance navigation and sequential task changes.
Results show RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and
demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on an aerial robot
in outdoor field tests.

*Rokas Bendikas,Daniel Dijkman,Markus Peschl,Sanjay Haresh,Pietro Mazzaglia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Oat-VLA introduces object-agent-centric tokenization to reduce computational costs in Vision-Language-Action models by minimizing visual tokens without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models have high computational costs due to inefficient visual tokenization schemes when adapting Vision-Language-Models for robotics.

Method: Proposes Object-Agent-centric Tokenization (Oat-VLA) that introduces inductive bias towards scene objects and agent's visual information, reducing visual tokens to just a few.

Result: Oat-VLA converges at least twice as fast as OpenVLA on LIBERO suite and outperforms OpenVLA in real-world pick and place tasks.

Conclusion: Object-agent-centric tokenization enables efficient VLA training with significantly reduced computational costs while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a pivotal approach to learning
robotic manipulation at scale by repurposing large pre-trained
Vision-Language-Models (VLM) to output robotic actions. However, adapting VLMs
for robotic domains comes with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which
we attribute to the tokenization scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim
to enable efficient VLA training by proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric
Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the insights of object-centric
representation learning, our method introduces an inductive bias towards scene
objects and the agent's own visual information. As a result, we find that
Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens to just a few tokens
without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least
twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in
diverse real-world pick and place tasks.

*Priyanka Mandikal,Jiaheng Hu,Shivin Dass,Sagnik Majumder,Roberto Martín-Martín,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARTA is a unified framework for object state change manipulation tasks like mashing, spreading, and slicing, using spatially-progressing object change segmentation to create structured policy observations and dense rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most robot manipulation focuses on kinematic state changes (picking, placing), but many real-world tasks involve progressive physical and visual state changes without position changes, requiring a different approach.

Method: SPARTA uses spatially-progressing object change segmentation maps to perceive actionable vs. transformed regions, generating structured policy observations and dense rewards. It offers two policy variants: reinforcement learning for fine-grained control and greedy control for fast deployment.

Result: SPARTA was validated on three challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual goal-conditioned baselines.

Conclusion: Progress-aware visual representations serve as a versatile foundation for object state manipulation tasks, enabling effective handling of spatially-progressing object changes.

Abstract: Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects:
picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of
real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state
change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and
visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We
present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state
change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common
structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes
that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a
transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially
progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive
actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to
generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance
variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time.
These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for
fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control
for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three
challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant
improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual
goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual
representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object
state manipulation tasks. Project website:

TL;DR: A hybrid RGB-D SLAM system combining learning-based pose initialization with optimization-based refinement to achieve robust real-time dense reconstruction under unstable camera motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RGB-D SLAM systems fail with large viewpoint changes, fast motions, or sudden shaking. Classical optimization methods struggle with poor initialization during large motions, while learning-based approaches lack sufficient accuracy for dense reconstruction.

Method: Uses camera pose regression network to predict metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames, then applies randomized optimization algorithm to further align depth images with scene geometry.

Result: Outperforms best competitors on challenging benchmarks while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable motion sequences. Operates in real-time.

Conclusion: Combining simple and principled techniques achieves both robustness for unstable motions and accuracy for dense reconstruction.

Abstract: Real-time dense scene reconstruction during unstable camera motions is
crucial for robotics, yet current RGB-D SLAM systems fail when cameras
experience large viewpoint changes, fast motions, or sudden shaking. Classical
optimization-based methods deliver high accuracy but fail with poor
initialization during large motions, while learning-based approaches provide
robustness but lack sufficient accuracy for dense reconstruction. We address
this challenge through a combination of learning-based initialization with
optimization-based refinement. Our method employs a camera pose regression
network to predict metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames,
which serve as reliable starting points for a randomized optimization algorithm
that further aligns depth images with the scene geometry. Extensive experiments
demonstrate promising results: our approach outperforms the best competitor on
challenging benchmarks, while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable motion
sequences. The system operates in real-time, showcasing that combining simple
and principled techniques can achieve both robustness for unstable motions and
accuracy for dense reconstruction. Project page:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CEDex is a cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis method that bridges human grasping kinematics with robot kinematics by aligning robot models with human-like contact representations, enabling large-scale grasp generation for diverse robotic hands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing grasp synthesis methods either lack human-like kinematic understanding or require extensive manual data collection limited to anthropomorphic structures, creating a need for scalable cross-embodiment grasp generation.

Method: CEDex uses a Conditional Variational Auto-encoder pretrained on human contact data to generate human-like contact representations, performs kinematic human contact alignment through topological merging, and conducts signed distance field-based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints.

Result: The method created the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset with 500K objects across four gripper types and 20M total grasps, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in experiments.

Conclusion: CEDex enables effective cross-embodiment grasp learning with high-quality diverse grasps, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and providing a valuable dataset for robotic manipulation research.

Abstract: Cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis refers to adaptively generating
and optimizing grasps for various robotic hands with different morphologies.
This capability is crucial for achieving versatile robotic manipulation in
diverse environments and requires substantial amounts of reliable and diverse
grasp data for effective model training and robust generalization. However,
existing approaches either rely on physics-based optimization that lacks
human-like kinematic understanding or require extensive manual data collection
processes that are limited to anthropomorphic structures. In this paper, we
propose CEDex, a novel cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis method at
scale that bridges human grasping kinematics and robot kinematics by aligning
robot kinematic models with generated human-like contact representations. Given
an object's point cloud and an arbitrary robotic hand model, CEDex first
generates human-like contact representations using a Conditional Variational
Auto-encoder pretrained on human contact data. It then performs kinematic human
contact alignment through topological merging to consolidate multiple human
hand parts into unified robot components, followed by a signed distance
field-based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints. Using CEDex, we
construct the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset to date, comprising 500K
objects across four gripper types with 20M total grasps. Extensive experiments
show that CEDex outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and our dataset
benefits cross-embodiment grasp learning with high-quality diverse grasps.

TL;DR: DRCP is a real-time cooperative perception framework that uses cross-modal fusion and diffusion-based refinement to improve detection accuracy in challenging driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cooperative perception systems struggle with hard detection cases like partial detections and noise accumulation, limiting real-world deployment effectiveness.

Method: Combines Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent module for cross-modal fusion using camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning, and Mask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation module for diffusion-based feature refinement.

Result: Achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly improving robustness under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: DRCP provides an effective solution for robust cooperative perception in dynamic driving environments, with planned code release in late 2025.

Abstract: Cooperative perception enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything communication has
shown great promise in enhancing situational awareness for autonomous vehicles
and other mobile robotic platforms. Despite recent advances in perception
backbones and multi-agent fusion, real-world deployments remain challenged by
hard detection cases, exemplified by partial detections and noise accumulation
which limit downstream detection accuracy. This work presents Diffusion on
Reinforced Cooperative Perception (DRCP), a real-time deployable framework
designed to address aforementioned issues in dynamic driving environments. DRCP
integrates two key components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent,
a cross-modal cooperative perception module that leverages
camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning for attention-based fusion and
adaptive convolution to better exploit external features; and (2)
Mask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation, a novel lightweight diffusion-based refinement
module that encourages robustness against feature perturbations and aligns
bird's-eye-view features closer to the task-optimal manifold. The proposed
system achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly
improving robustness under challenging conditions. Code will be released in
late 2025.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to transition to unstructured human environments and follow natural language instructions, but existing datasets lack synchronized force-torque sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases for robust mobile manipulation.

Method: Created a dataset with 25,469 episodes (94 hours) collected using Human Support Robot (HSR), featuring synchronized RGB images, joint states, six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states with a two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions.

Result: The dataset provides a comprehensive benchmark for contact-rich and long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks, standardized in LeRobot v2.1 format and publicly available.

Conclusion: AIRoA MoMa Dataset addresses critical gaps in multimodal robotics datasets and serves as a foundation for advancing the next generation of Vision-Language-Action models in mobile manipulation.

Abstract: As robots transition from controlled settings to unstructured human
environments, building generalist agents that can reliably follow natural
language instructions remains a central challenge. Progress in robust mobile
manipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich
and long-horizon tasks, yet existing resources lack synchronized force-torque
sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this
gap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset
for mobile manipulation. It includes synchronized RGB images, joint states,
six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states, together with a
novel two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions for
hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial dataset comprises 25,469
episodes (approx. 94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot (HSR) and is
fully standardized in the LeRobot v2.1 format. By uniquely integrating mobile
manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure, AIRoA MoMa
provides a critical benchmark for advancing the next generation of
Vision-Language-Action models. The first version of our dataset is now

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MAS² introduces a recursive self-generation paradigm where multi-agent systems autonomously architect bespoke agent systems for diverse problems, achieving significant performance gains without excessive token costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems follow a rigid 'generate-once-and-deploy' paradigm, making them brittle and ill-prepared for real-world dynamism and uncertainty. There's a need for systems that can adaptively compose and rectify themselves in response to real-time task demands.

Method: A 'generator-implementer-rectifier' tri-agent team that dynamically composes and adaptively rectifies target agent systems. Uses Collaborative Tree Optimization to train and specialize meta-agents for recursive self-generation.

Result: Achieves performance gains up to 19.6% over state-of-the-art MAS in complex scenarios like deep research and code generation. Shows superior cross-backbone generalization with improvements up to 15.1% using previously unseen LLMs, while maintaining optimal cost-performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: MAS² successfully transcends the limitations of current multi-agent systems by enabling autonomous, adaptive system architecture through recursive self-generation, demonstrating significant performance improvements across diverse benchmarks without excessive computational costs.

Abstract: The past two years have witnessed the meteoric rise of Large Language Model
(LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS), which harness collective intelligence
and exhibit a remarkable trajectory toward self-evolution. This paradigm has
rapidly progressed from manually engineered systems that require bespoke
configuration of prompts, tools, roles, and communication protocols toward
frameworks capable of automated orchestration. Yet, dominant automatic
multi-agent systems, whether generated by external modules or a single LLM
agent, largely adhere to a rigid ``\textit{generate-once-and-deploy}''
paradigm, rendering the resulting systems brittle and ill-prepared for the
dynamism and uncertainty of real-world environments. To transcend this
limitation, we introduce MAS$^2$, a paradigm predicated on the principle of
recursive self-generation: a multi-agent system that autonomously architects
bespoke multi-agent systems for diverse problems. Technically, we devise a
``\textit{generator-implementer-rectifier}'' tri-agent team capable of
dynamically composing and adaptively rectifying a target agent system in
response to real-time task demands. Collaborative Tree Optimization is proposed
to train and specialize these meta-agents. Extensive evaluation across seven
benchmarks reveals that MAS$^2$ achieves performance gains of up to $19.6\%$
over state-of-the-art MAS in complex scenarios such as deep research and code
generation. Moreover, MAS$^2$ exhibits superior cross-backbone generalization,
effectively leveraging previously unseen LLMs to yield improvements of up to
$15.1\%$. Crucially, these gains are attained without incurring excessive token
costs, as MAS$^2$ consistently resides on the Pareto frontier of
cost-performance trade-offs. The source codes are available at

*Tobias Holtdirk,Dennis Assenmacher,Arnim Bleier,Claudia Wagner*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs on partial survey data effectively imputes missing vote choices, outperforming zero-shot methods and often matching or beating tabular classifiers, especially with biased convenience samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address rising survey costs and missing data issues by leveraging LLMs to simulate respondents, particularly when only partial responses or biased convenience samples are available.

Method: Fine-tune small (3B to 8B) open-source LLMs on available survey data from the German Longitudinal Election Study, comparing against zero-shot prompting and tabular classifiers like CatBoost under different missing data scenarios.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs match tabular classifiers when data are missing completely at random, and outperform both zero-shot and tabular methods when only biased convenience samples are available for both individual predictions and population distributions.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs offer a promising approach for handling non-probability samples and systematic missingness, potentially enabling new survey designs that only require easily accessible subpopulations.

Abstract: Survey researchers face two key challenges: the rising costs of probability
samples and missing data (e.g., non-response or attrition), which can undermine
inference and increase the use of convenience samples. Recent work explores
using large language models (LLMs) to simulate respondents via persona-based
prompts, often without labeled data. We study a more practical setting where
partial survey responses exist: we fine-tune LLMs on available data to impute
self-reported vote choice under both random and systematic nonresponse, using
the German Longitudinal Election Study. We compare zero-shot prompting and
supervised fine-tuning against tabular classifiers (e.g., CatBoost) and test
how different convenience samples (e.g., students) used for fine-tuning affect
generalization.
  Our results show that when data are missing completely at random, fine-tuned
LLMs match tabular classifiers but outperform zero-shot approaches. When only
biased convenience samples are available, fine-tuning small (3B to 8B)
open-source LLMs can recover both individual-level predictions and
population-level distributions more accurately than zero-shot and often better
than tabular methods. This suggests fine-tuned LLMs offer a promising strategy
for researchers working with non-probability samples or systematic missingness,
and may enable new survey designs requiring only easily accessible
subpopulations.

*Raghavv Goel,Junyoung Park,Mukul Gagrani,Dalton Jones,Matthew Morse,Harper Langston,Mingu Lee,Chris Lott*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAOTE is a token eviction method that uses attention output contributions instead of just attention scores, improving accuracy when combined with existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token eviction methods use attention scores as importance metrics, but they lack information about tokens' actual contributions to attention outputs, creating limitations in resource-constrained devices.

Method: Proposes CAOTE, which integrates attention scores and value vectors to optimize eviction error by considering tokens' contributions to attention outputs in closed-form.

Result: CAOTE consistently improves downstream task accuracies when combined with state-of-the-art attention score-based methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging value token information during token eviction is crucial for better performance, and CAOTE serves as an effective meta-heuristic that enhances existing methods.

Abstract: While long context support of large language models has extended their
abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes
crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely
adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by
evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores
as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of
attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the
information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this
paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of
cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction
error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and
value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of
attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as
a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We
show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based
methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the
importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between interpretability and predictive performance in machine learning for high-stakes fields like healthcare, where GAMs sacrifice interactions for interpretability and CESR includes interactions but performs poorly.

Method: Introduces Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs) that augment CESR with an additive part to disentangle coefficients, broadening the hypothesis space while maintaining visualizable shape functions.

Result: Neural network-based MACMs significantly outperform both CESR and state-of-the-art GAMs in predictive performance while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: MACMs successfully bridge the gap between interpretability and performance by combining multiplicative and additive components, offering improved predictive power while preserving model interpretability.

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPO-PoP extends Direct Preference Optimization by using preference-over-preference annotations to infer adaptive margins, improving performance over fixed-margin approaches and showing a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing margin-based optimization methods in RLHF use fixed or simplistic margins that don't account for varying preference strengths, and many assume access to accurate preference scores which are difficult for humans to provide reliably.

Method: Proposed DPO-PoP extension that leverages preference-over-preference annotations (ordinal signals indicating which of two preferences reflects stronger distinction) to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis.

Result: Outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on UltraFeedback dataset. Shows tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance - improving test classification accuracy can lead to decline in generative quality.

Conclusion: Modeling preference strength through adaptive margins improves alignment and generalization. Two sampling strategies are proposed to navigate the discriminative-generative tradeoff: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance.

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

TL;DR: The paper investigates representation geometry in LLMs using spectral analysis, revealing three distinct geometric phases during pretraining and showing how post-training methods differently affect model geometry and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard training metrics fail to explain the emergence of complex capabilities in large language models, motivating a spectral approach to understand representation geometry.

Method: Spectral analysis using effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay (α-ReQ) on OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models across pretraining and post-training phases.

Result: Uncovered three consistent geometric phases: initial representational collapse, followed by dimensionality expansion coinciding with peak n-gram memorization, then anisotropic consolidation that improves downstream performance. Post-training methods show different geometric effects.

Conclusion: Model geometry evolves through predictable phases driven by cross-entropy optimization under token frequency skew and representational bottlenecks, with post-training methods inducing distinct geometric transformations that trade off different performance aspects.

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

Motivation: LLMs often use shortcut strategies that produce correct answers with unfaithful reasoning, making them vulnerable to small causal perturbations.

Method: Uses Jacobian-based sensitivities to estimate model-internal influence, counterfactually hardens signals, and fuses coherence scores with task accuracy via Minkowski combiner. Integrates with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes.

Result: Improves accuracy by 5.49% on average (up to 9.58%) across 4 datasets, reduces reward hacking and unfaithful chain-of-thought, and enhances robustness to correlation-causation flips and counterfactual edits.

Conclusion: CE-PO effectively balances accuracy and causal coherence, providing a drop-in solution to improve LLM reasoning faithfulness and robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

*Haoyu He,Haozheng Luo,Yan Chen,Qi R. Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RHYTHM is a unified framework using LLMs for human mobility prediction, employing temporal tokenization and hierarchical attention to capture daily/weekly dependencies while reducing sequence length and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human mobility prediction is challenging due to complex long-range dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors that existing methods struggle to capture effectively.

Method: Uses temporal tokenization to partition trajectories into daily segments, encodes them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention, adds pre-computed prompt embeddings via frozen LLM, and freezes the pretrained LLM backbone to reduce complexity.

Result: Achieves 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in training time compared to state-of-the-art methods on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RHYTHM effectively leverages LLMs for human mobility prediction by capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency through frozen backbone and hierarchical tokenization.

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

*Haotian Liu,Shuo Wang,Hongteng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C²GSPG is a confidence-calibration group sequence policy gradient method that enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence in reinforcement learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods like GRPO suffer from overconfidence issues that prevent achieving self-aware reasoning models, limiting their effectiveness in reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework to eliminate token-level bias, defines model confidence using normalized sequence-level probability, and applies cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate confidence to reward.

Result: C²GSPG shows superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and confidence calibration on logical and mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The confidence calibration regularizer and GSPG framework work collaboratively to improve reasoning performance while effectively suppressing overconfidence in language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at

*Bingshuai Liu,Ante Wang,Zijun Min,Liang Yao,Haibo Zhang,Yang Liu,Anxiang Zeng,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEC-RL is a novel framework that accelerates RL training for LLMs by reusing overlapping trajectory segments from consecutive epochs through speculative decoding, reducing rollout time by 2-3x without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL training for LLMs is bottlenecked by computationally expensive rollout stages, and existing acceleration methods have limitations like diminishing returns, bias introduction, or overlooking redundancy across iterations.

Method: Integrates speculative decoding with RL rollout process by reusing prior trajectory segments as speculative prefixes and extending them via a draft-and-verify mechanism to avoid redundant generation while ensuring policy consistency.

Result: Reduces rollout time by 2-3x across diverse math reasoning and generalization benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM) without compromising policy quality.

Conclusion: SPEC-RL provides a general and practical enhancement for scaling RL with verifiable rewards for large reasoning models, seamlessly integrating with mainstream RL algorithms like PPO, GRPO, and DAPO.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether machine learning models can generalize to future data using only past data through parameter interpolation and extrapolation methods, finding that none consistently outperform simply using the latest model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often fail to maintain performance under distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data. The research aims to determine if models can achieve generalization using only past data.

Method: The study explores two approaches: parameter interpolation (convex combinations of past model parameters) and parameter extrapolation (explicit extrapolation beyond the convex hull of past parameters). These methods are benchmarked on diverse temporal tasks including language modeling, news summarization, image classification, and more.

Result: Empirical findings show that none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of using the latest available model parameters across all scenarios.

Conclusion: In the absence of future data or robust assumptions about data-generating processes, these results highlight the inherent difficulties of generalizing to future data and warrant caution when evaluating claims of such generalization.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes comprehensive scaling laws specifically for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, addressing the limitations of existing dense model scaling laws by systematically analyzing five key factors and their interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scaling laws for dense models are inapplicable to MoE models due to multiple influencing factors, intricate coupling relationships, and non-monotonic performance impacts, necessitating MoE-specific scaling laws.

Method: Systematic decomposition of MoE settings into five key factors (data size D, total model size N, activated model size Na, number of active experts G, ratio of shared experts S), conducting 446 controlled experiments to characterize marginal effects and construct joint scaling laws.

Result: Developed comprehensive joint MoE scaling law considering all essential factors; found optimal settings for G and S are independent of model architecture and data size; optimal activation parameter ratio Na/N becomes sparser with scaling of N.

Conclusion: The proposed MoE scaling law provides accurate and insightful guidance for future MoE model design and training, enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT) improves upon Dynamic Fine-Tuning by adding KL regularization to prevent distributional drift, achieving better performance than both SFT and DFT across multiple domains with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between SFT (efficient but memorizes) and RL (better generalization but costly), and fix DFT's instability issues caused by distributional drift.

Method: Propose ASFT which augments DFT's reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tight RL bounds while ensuring training stability.

Result: ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code generation with substantial improvements.

Conclusion: The RWR framework provides systematic understanding of post-training methods, showing principled theoretical analysis leads to stronger guarantees and practical gains.

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates knowledge homophily in LLMs and proposes a GNN-based method to estimate entity knowledgeability scores, enabling more efficient active labeling and improved knowledge coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structural organization of knowledge in LLMs and leverage cognitive neuroscience principles like semantic clustering and priming to improve knowledge-intensive applications.

Method: Map LLM knowledge into graph representation, analyze knowledge homophily patterns, and develop a GNN regression model to predict entity-level knowledgeability scores for prioritizing triplet checking.

Result: Discovered that LLMs exhibit knowledge homophily where entities positioned closer in the graph have similar knowledge levels. The proposed method improves active labeling efficiency and enhances multi-hop reasoning in QA tasks.

Conclusion: The knowledge homophily principle in LLMs can be effectively leveraged through graph-based approaches to optimize knowledge coverage and improve performance in reasoning-intensive applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

*Fanding Huang,Guanbo Huang,Xiao Fan,Yi He,Xiao Liang,Xiao Chen,Qinting Jiang,Faisal Nadeem Khan,Jingyan Jiang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the traditional exploration-exploitation trade-off view in RLVR, proposing that this trade-off is an artifact of measurement level rather than a fundamental constraint. By analyzing hidden-state space using Effective Rank metrics, the authors show exploration and exploitation can be decoupled, leading to their VERL method that enhances both simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To re-examine the prevailing exploration-exploitation trade-off perspective in RLVR, which the authors argue may be an artifact of token-level metrics rather than a fundamental constraint.

Method: Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL) - shifts analysis to hidden-state space using Effective Rank (ER) and its derivatives (ERV and ERA) to quantify exploration/exploitation dynamics, then directly shapes the RL advantage function using ERA as a predictive meta-controller for synergistic enhancement.

Result: Experiments show consistent gains across diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks, including up to 21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

Conclusion: Exploration and exploitation can be decoupled at the hidden-state level, enabling simultaneous enhancement of both capacities through the VERL method, which operationalizes synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement.

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DOC fine-tuning addresses catastrophic forgetting in LLMs by tracking functional direction drift and enforcing orthogonality between new and historical task parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in LLM continual learning occurs when models lose performance on historical tasks during fine-tuning on new data, and existing regularization methods fail due to functional direction drift.

Method: Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning tracks the drift of functional directions during fine-tuning and dynamically updates them, while adjusting new task gradients to be orthogonal to historical function directions.

Result: Extensive experiments on LLM continual learning benchmarks show DOC outperforms prior methods, effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: DOC provides a robust solution for continuous LLM fine-tuning by mitigating interference between new and old tasks through dynamic orthogonal parameter adjustment.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures using an internal metric (MUI) to understand their mechanisms, revealing insights about neuron utilization, training dynamics, expert collaboration, and activation patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE research is performance-centric with limited understanding of internal mechanisms, constraining broader progress. The authors aim to investigate MoE architecture mechanisms by analyzing routing mechanisms and expert-level behaviors.

Method: Used an internal metric (MUI) to systematically analyze a wide range of publicly available MoE models, incorporating routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors.

Result: Found that: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, indicating stronger generalization; (2) training shows dynamic trajectory with MUI revealing deeper insights than benchmark performance alone; (3) task completion involves collaborative expert contributions with shared experts driving concentration; (4) neuron-level activation patterns serve as fine-grained proxy for data diversity.

Conclusion: MUI serves as a complementary indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into MoE model capacity, dynamics, and specialization. The findings demonstrate the potential of internal metrics for understanding MoE mechanisms.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E²C is a structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into exploration (generating high-level plans) and execution (carrying out plans), achieving high efficiency with fewer tokens and better performance than Chain-of-Thought variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought methods conflate planning and execution, leading to computational inefficiency, limited path exploration, and reduced interpretability.

Method: Two-phase framework: exploratory phase generates stochastic high-level plans, execution phase deterministically carries out chosen plans. Uses two-stage training with SFT (enforcing plan adherence) and RL (reinforcing exploration and execution determinism).

Result: Achieves 58.1% accuracy on AIME'2024 using <10% of decoding tokens vs. comparable methods. EF-SFT fine-tuning with 3.5% tokens yields up to 14.5% higher accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks.

Conclusion: E²C provides state-of-the-art performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating planning from execution, sharply reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are

TL;DR: Proposes model-agnostic methods using penultimate layer features to detect and correct label errors in datasets by analyzing feature similarity within class clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise in datasets damages neural network training performance, and there's growing demand for automated error detection tools as network sizes increase.

Method: Utilizes penultimate features from neural networks, observing that mislabeled data points have higher similarity to true class data points than to other classes, using label probability within tight clusters for error detection and rectification.

Result: Extensive experiments show high performance across various noise types and automatic rectification improves dataset quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively detects and corrects label errors using penultimate feature analysis, enhancing dataset reliability for neural network training.

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

TL;DR: This paper provides a first-principles derivation showing that group-relative REINFORCE can be interpreted as an off-policy algorithm, challenging the conventional view that REINFORCE variants are strictly on-policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing interest in off-policy RL for LLMs due to practical constraints, complex infrastructure requirements, and need for RL methodology innovations.

Method: First-principles derivation of group-relative REINFORCE without assuming specific training data distribution, revealing its native off-policy interpretation and proposing two adaptation principles: policy update regularization and active data distribution shaping.

Result: The analysis demystifies myths about importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies OPMD and AsymRE as regularized REINFORCE forms, provides theoretical justification for data-weighting strategies, and offers actionable insights validated through empirical studies.

Conclusion: The work opens up new opportunities for principled algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs by providing a unified theoretical framework and practical guidance.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths

### [659] [LEAF: A Robust Expert-Based Framework for Few-Shot Continual Event Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24547)
*Bao-Ngoc Dao,Quang Nguyen,Luyen Ngo Dinh,Minh Le,Linh Ngo Van*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEAF is a novel expert-based framework for Few-shot Continual Event Detection that addresses catastrophic forgetting and limited data challenges through specialized mixture of experts with LoRA parameterization, semantic-aware routing, contrastive learning with label descriptions, and knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches suffer from severe forgetting due to full fine-tuning of shared base models causing knowledge interference, and rely on unnatural data augmentation strategies that introduce semantic distortions.

Method: Integrates specialized mixture of experts with LoRA matrices, uses semantic-aware expert selection for dynamic routing, incorporates contrastive learning guided by label descriptions, and employs knowledge distillation to prevent overfitting on memory buffer.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: LEAF effectively addresses the dual challenges of few-shot learning and catastrophic forgetting in continual event detection through its expert-based architecture and robust learning strategies.

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Liang Lin,Zhihao Xu,Junhao Dong,Jian Zhao,Yuchen Yuan,Guibin Zhang,Miao Yu,Yiming Zhang,Zhengtao Yao,Huahui Yi,Dongrui Liu,Xinfeng Li,Kun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OrthAlign uses orthogonal subspace decomposition to resolve gradient conflicts in multi-objective LLM alignment, enabling stable optimization across competing preferences like helpfulness and harmlessness without trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods face trade-offs between competing objectives, where improvements in one dimension (e.g., helpfulness) come at the expense of others (e.g., harmlessness). Existing approaches overlook fundamental parameter-level conflicts.

Method: OrthAlign decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically non-interfering directions. It provides theoretical guarantees for linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability.

Result: OrthAlign achieves 34.61% to 50.89% maximum single-preference improvements across helpful, harmless, and truthful dimensions after multi-objective alignment, with 13.96% average overall reward improvement.

Conclusion: OrthAlign pioneers a new paradigm for multi-objective preference alignment by fundamentally resolving gradient-level conflicts through orthogonal subspace decomposition, enabling stable convergence across all preference dimensions without trade-offs.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

*Sanxing Chen,Xiaoyin Chen,Yukun Huang,Roy Xie,Bhuwan Dhingra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs trained with SFT and RL outperform pre-trained models in multi-armed bandit tasks, achieving performance comparable to UCB and Thompson Sampling with robust generalization, but exhibit greedier exploitation that can lead to early catastrophic failure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have potential as autonomous agents but explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. The paper investigates how SFT and RL training methods shape exploration strategies and their generalization capabilities.

Method: Train LLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on expert trajectories and reinforcement learning (RL) with tailored reward signals including regret-shaped rewards and algorithmic rewards for oracle imitation.

Result: Trained agents outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to UCB and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x longer horizons and across bandit families. However, they exhibit greedier exploitation and are more prone to early catastrophic failure.

Conclusion: SFT and RL training improve LLM exploration but can lead to premature abandonment of exploration. Tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret are needed to promote robust exploratory behavior.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

### [662] [Scaling with Collapse: Efficient and Predictable Training of LLM Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25087)
*Shane Bergsma,Bin Claire Zhang,Nolan Dey,Shaheer Muhammad,Gurpreet Gosal,Joel Hestness*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training loss curves collapse onto universal trajectories when optimization hyperparameters are optimally scaled, serving as a signature of compute-efficient LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether loss curve collapse phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under practical scaling recipes where multiple parameters are scaled jointly.

Method: Analyzed loss curve collapse across different model scales when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally according to empirical scaling laws.

Result: Loss curves collapse precisely when hyperparameters are optimally set for given data budgets, enabling applications like training pathology detection and early stopping in hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: Collapse serves as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs, demonstrated by training the competitive Celerity LLM family using these insights.

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve knowledge distillation for LLMs by moving beyond standard Chain-of-Thought distillation and enabling more effective cross-architecture knowledge transfer.

Method: Uses Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization objective to contrast teacher and student reasoning traces, with a mixed-policy strategy for utilizing student-generated outputs.

Result: Consistent improvements over conventional black-box knowledge distillation baselines across five datasets and multiple student models.

Abstract: We introduce ORPO-Distill, a general-purpose method for cross-architecture
LLM distillation that formulates the problem as a preference optimization task.
Unlike standard CoT distillation, the approach transfers knowledge through
diverse reasoning traces. It employs an Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization
objective that contrasts teacher and student traces for more effective
learning, and adopts a mixed-policy strategy for utilizing student-generated
outputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives. Experiments on

*Yuxian Jiang,Yafu Li,Guanxu Chen,Dongrui Liu,Yu Cheng,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIREN addresses entropy collapse in RLVR for large reasoning models through selective entropy regularization with two-step masking and self-anchored regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR enhances reasoning in LRMs but suffers from entropy collapse and premature convergence due to global entropy explosion from vast action spaces and long trajectories.

Method: SIREN uses two-step entropy masking (top-p mask and peak-entropy mask) to confine exploration to meaningful actions/states, plus self-anchored regularization for training stability.

Result: Achieves superior performance on five math benchmarks, with +6.6 maj@k improvement on AIME24/25 using Qwen2.5-Math-7B, promotes response diversity and maintains appropriate entropy levels.

Conclusion: SIREN effectively mitigates premature convergence in RLVR for LRMs by maintaining validation pass@k throughout training through controlled entropy management.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

*Haoming Wen,Yushi Bai,Juanzi Li,Jie Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIRI is a reinforcement learning method that alternates between compressing and expanding reasoning length during training, improving both performance and efficiency in Large Reasoning Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with the trade-off between reducing repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs and maintaining performance.

Method: Iteratively alternates between compression (reducing rollout length) and expansion (relaxing length limit) phases during training to dynamically adjust reasoning budget.

Result: After three iterations, SIRI-low improved AIME24 performance by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9%; SIRI-high achieved the highest accuracy among all methods.

Conclusion: Periodically oscillating output truncation length during training helps balance exploration and efficiency, converging toward an optimal performance-efficiency trade-off.

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.

*Pavan Reddy,Aditya Sanjay Gujral*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Localized adversarial attacks using binary masks achieve better imperceptibility than global attacks but require more computation and slightly lower success rates, with iterative methods performing better than single-step approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored potential of localized adversarial noise compared to traditional global perturbations, and systematically evaluate their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational efficiency.

Method: Systematically evaluated localized adversarial attacks using FGSM, PGD, and C&W methods with binary masks to constrain noise to specific regions, comparing mean pixel perturbations, PSNR, SSIM, computational effort, and Attack Success Rate.

Result: Localized attacks achieved significantly lower mean pixel perturbations, higher PSNR, and improved SSIM compared to global attacks, but with increased computational effort and modest reduction in Attack Success Rate. Iterative methods (PGD, C&W) were more robust than single-step methods (FGSM).

Conclusion: Localized adversarial attacks offer improved imperceptibility at the cost of computational efficiency, with iterative methods being more effective, providing insights for advancing attack strategies and designing robust defensive systems.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MonoCon is a framework that uses a small monotonic MLP head attached to pre-trained encoders with contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints to learn robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings with minimal performance cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations in AI, which current methods primarily tackle through architectural and optimization constraints.

Method: Attach a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head to any pre-trained encoder and train with contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, leveraging co-adaptation between encoder and head.

Result: On CIFAR-100: 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust representations while retaining 99% of baseline's 5-NN classification accuracy. On SNLI: 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more robust with marginal STSb score reduction.

Conclusion: MonoCon provides a general domain-agnostic framework that learns robust, ultra-compact representations through functional constraints, offering unified solutions for edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval applications.

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

*Jonas Ngnawé,Maxime Heuillet,Sabyasachi Sahoo,Yann Pequignot,Ola Ahmad,Audrey Durand,Frédéric Precioso,Christian Gagné*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning non-robust pretrained models with robust objectives can cause suboptimal transfer and poor performance. The paper proposes Epsilon-Scheduling to prevent this issue and introduces expected robustness as a comprehensive evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are abundant non-robust pretrained models available, but their potential for robust fine-tuning (RFT) is not well understood. The paper aims to systematically examine RFT from non-robust models and address the challenges of suboptimal transfer.

Method: The paper proposes Epsilon-Scheduling, a schedule over perturbation strength during training that promotes optimal transfer. It also introduces expected robustness as a metric to evaluate accuracy-robustness trade-off across various perturbations.

Result: Extensive experiments across six pretrained models and five datasets show that Epsilon-Scheduling successfully prevents suboptimal transfer and consistently improves expected robustness, especially in challenging scenarios with difficult tasks or high perturbations.

Conclusion: Epsilon-Scheduling effectively addresses the suboptimal transfer problem in robust fine-tuning of non-robust pretrained models, providing a practical solution for achieving both task adaptation and adversarial robustness simultaneously.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

*Xi Ding,Lei Wang,Piotr Koniusz,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR) is a framework that uses model predictions to create relational graphs that regularize feature learning, promoting class-aware representations without architecture changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks learn rich representations but often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict predicted semantics, requiring better feature structure alignment.

Method: Introduces parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) that align batch-level feature similarity graphs with global class-aware prediction graphs using multi-layer cross-space alignment with adaptive weighting.

Result: GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization across various networks and datasets without modifying architectures.

Conclusion: GCR offers a lightweight, model-agnostic approach to enhance semantic feature structure through self-prompting from prediction relationships, providing a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

Result: Achieves high efficiency and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions, while dramatically reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: GBSK provides an effective solution for scalable clustering of large datasets, with the adaptive version AGBSK enhancing usability for real-world deployment.

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a
novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with
up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and

TL;DR: The paper introduces an agent-driven federated learning framework and FedAgentBench benchmark to evaluate LLM agents' ability to autonomously coordinate healthcare FL workflows, addressing practical orchestration challenges that hinder real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world FL deployment in healthcare faces complex operational challenges requiring substantial human effort, including client selection, coordination, data pre-processing, data harmonization, and algorithm selection. Existing FL works overlook these practical orchestration challenges.

Method: Proposed an agent-driven FL framework capturing key phases of real-world FL workflows and FedAgentBench benchmark with 40 FL algorithms, 201 curated datasets across 6 healthcare modalities, evaluating 24 LLMs (14 open-source, 10 proprietary) of various scales.

Result: Some agent cores like GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3 can automate various FL pipeline stages, but more complex interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging even for the strongest models.

Conclusion: Agent-driven FL systems show promise for autonomous coordination of healthcare FL workflows, but significant challenges remain for complex interdependent tasks requiring implicit goal understanding.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

Uses adaptive data curation including pre-collecting successful trajectories, dynamic rollout adjustment, selective training on high-entropy steps, and truncated importance sampling.

Result: Achieves 42.13% task success rate on OSWorld benchmark (14.61% absolute gain over base model, 7.34% higher than open-source SOTA). System efficiency improvements: 1.6× GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9× training throughput, and 5.5× environment utilization.

Conclusion: DART framework significantly improves RL training efficiency and performance for GUI agents through decoupled architecture and adaptive data curation, with plans to fully open-source the framework, data, and model checkpoints.

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

### [673] [SLA: Beyond Sparsity in Diffusion Transformers via Fine-Tunable Sparse-Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24006)
*Jintao Zhang,Haoxu Wang,Kai Jiang,Shuo Yang,Kaiwen Zheng,Haocheng Xi,Ziteng Wang,Hongzhou Zhu,Min Zhao,Ion Stoica,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention) accelerates diffusion transformer models by fusing sparse and linear attention, reducing attention computation by 95% and achieving 2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention latency is a major bottleneck in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models for video generation due to long sequence lengths and quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms.

Method: SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and negligible categories, applying O(N²) attention to critical weights, O(N) linear attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. It combines these computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward passes.

Result: SLA achieves 20x reduction in attention computation, 95% computation reduction without degrading generation quality, 13.7x speedup in attention computation, and 2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

Conclusion: SLA effectively accelerates DiT models by exploiting the natural separation of attention weights into high-rank and low-rank components, achieving significant speed improvements while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

*Umang Garg,Bowen Zhang,Anantanjit Subrahmanya,Chandrakanth Gudavalli,BS Manjunath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPS-MTM is a foundation model for mobility data that decomposes trajectories into states (POI categories) and actions (transitions), using a bi-directional Transformer with masked modeling to learn semantic patterns without manual labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have shown success in text, vision, and video understanding, but similar breakthroughs are needed for trajectory modeling to capture patterns in human movement data.

Method: Decomposes mobility into states and actions modalities, uses bi-directional Transformer with self-supervised masked modeling objective to reconstruct missing segments across modalities.

Result: Consistently outperforms on trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction across benchmark datasets (Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, Geolife), with strongest advantages in dynamic tasks requiring contextual reasoning.

Conclusion: GPS-MTM establishes itself as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning.

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further
reference.

*Youssef Sabiri,Walid Houmaidi,Ouail El Maadi,Yousra Chtouki*

TL;DR: AQUAIR is an open-access dataset of indoor environmental quality variables from a fish aquaculture facility, providing over 23,000 quality-controlled observations for smart aquaculture research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public datasets describing air conditions around indoor aquaculture tanks are scarce, limiting development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that connect head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics.

Method: Used a single Awair HOME monitor to sample six IEQ variables (air temperature, humidity, CO2, VOCs, PM2.5, PM10) every 5 minutes from Oct 2024 to Jan 2025, with ISO-compliant mounting, calibration checks, and an open-source processing pipeline for data normalization.

Result: Produced a dataset showing stable environmental conditions with feeding-time peaks, suitable for short-horizon forecasting, event detection, and sensor drift studies.

Conclusion: AQUAIR fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for machine learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space
dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Clebsch-Gordan Transformer achieves efficient global attention using Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on SO(3) irreducible representations, enabling equivariant modeling of all-order features with O(N log N) complexity while scaling well with high-order features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing equivariant transformers are limited to low-order features and local context windows due to quadratic computational costs of global attention, restricting their expressiveness and performance.

Method: Proposes Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on SO(3) irreducible representations for efficient global attention, exploits sparsity of Clebsch-Gordon matrix for scaling with high-order features, and incorporates optional token permutation equivariance.

Result: Achieves O(N log N) input token complexity, scales well with high-order irreducible features, and shows clear gains in GPU memory size, speed, and accuracy across n-body simulation, QM9, ModelNet classification, and robotic grasping benchmarks.

Conclusion: The Clebsch-Gordan Transformer enables efficient global equivariant attention with superior performance compared to existing equivariant transformers, overcoming computational limitations while maintaining expressiveness.

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

TL;DR: Using coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to guide sampling in pretrained generative models for image editing, achieving high prompt fidelity while preserving source image details without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods with pretrained text-to-image models often distort fine details or introduce artifacts, making content editing challenging.

Method: Propose using coupled SDEs to guide sampling process of any pretrained generative model that can be sampled by solving SDEs (including diffusion and rectified flow models), driving both source and edited images with same correlated noise.

Result: Achieves high prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency, steering new samples toward desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to source image.

Conclusion: Coupled SDEs position as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI, working out-of-the-box without retraining or auxiliary networks.

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALT (Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training) replaces EMA-based teacher updates in V-JEPA with a frozen teacher, achieving better performance and compute efficiency for video representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity and scalability issues of EMA-based teacher updates in V-JEPA, which complicate model selection and couple teacher-student architectures.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) train teacher encoder with pixel reconstruction under V-JEPA masking, then (2) freeze teacher and train student to predict teacher's latents on masked regions without regularization.

Result: SALT outperforms V-JEPA 2 encoders in frozen evaluation across benchmarks, achieves higher compute efficiency, and shows student quality is robust to teacher quality.

Conclusion: SALT provides a simpler, more scalable and compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video representation learning.

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

TL;DR: SAIP is a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the scale parameter in diffusion-based inverse problem solving, improving reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks without requiring retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based inverse problem methods use fixed, manually tuned scales to balance prior and likelihood scores, which is suboptimal as the ideal balance varies across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization.

Method: Proposed SAIP module that adaptively refines the scale parameter at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone, integrating seamlessly into existing samplers.

Result: SAIP consistently improves reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: SAIP provides an effective solution to the suboptimal static scale design in diffusion-based inverse problem solving, offering adaptive refinement that enhances performance without requiring model modifications.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks
such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a
Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score
with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable,
estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these
methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood
contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies
across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address
this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the
scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone.
SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves
reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including
challenging scenarios.

*Giordano Cicchetti,Eleonora Grassucci,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIANGLE is a novel similarity measure that improves multimodal alignment by computing triangle-area similarity in high-dimensional embedding space, achieving state-of-the-art results in three-modal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models suffer from ineffective modality alignment, where some modalities may not be properly aligned, undermining model performance in downstream tasks that require exploiting information from all modalities.

Method: TRIANGLE computes similarity directly in the higher-dimensional space spanned by modality embeddings using a triangle-area similarity approach, avoiding additional fusion layers or pairwise similarities, and is incorporated into contrastive losses to replace cosine similarity.

Result: TRIANGLE significantly boosts multimodal modeling performance, achieving state-of-the-art results across different datasets in three-modal tasks (video-text and audio-text retrieval, audio-video classification), improving cosine-based methods by up to 9 points of Recall@1.

Conclusion: TRIANGLE provides an effective approach for joint alignment of three modalities through geometric learning, yielding both performance improvements and interpretable alignment rationales in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence
systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more
comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art
models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful
development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide
indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a
result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of
the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide
additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we
present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed
similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space
spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of
three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion
layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses
replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of
multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales.
Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text
retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves
state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of
cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

*Mingxing Rao,Bowen Qu,Daniel Moyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents SimA, a single-query membership inference attack for diffusion models that uses the norm of predicted noise vectors to detect training data membership, showing that latent diffusion models are less vulnerable due to their auto-encoder bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Membership inference attacks against diffusion models pose serious privacy risks by revealing whether specific samples were used in training, requiring effective detection methods.

Method: The authors propose SimA, a single-query attack that leverages the observation that denoiser output norms encode proximity to training data, providing a more efficient alternative to multi-query methods.

Result: SimA achieves strong performance across DDPM and LDM variants, with latent diffusion models being surprisingly less vulnerable due to the information bottleneck from their auto-encoder architecture.

Conclusion: The study solidifies score-based MIA theory while highlighting that latent diffusion models require better understanding of VAE inversion, not just diffusion process inversion, for improved robustness.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as
a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a
given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and
empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors
that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser
output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples,
such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals
membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query
attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing
multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across
variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent
Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due
to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We
further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters
($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM
training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based
MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better
understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion
process

TL;DR: An uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty for short-term wildfire danger forecasting, improving both predictive accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfires pose severe threats, but deep learning adoption is hindered by reliability concerns and lack of uncertainty quantification in predictions.

Method: Developed an uncertainty-aware DL framework that captures both epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty for wildfire danger forecasting.

Result: In next-day forecasting, best model improved F1 Score by 2.3% and reduced Expected Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to deterministic baseline. Uncertainty estimates proved reliable for decision support.

Conclusion: Joint modeling of both uncertainty types provides complementary insights, significantly improving wildfire danger forecasting accuracy and reliability for trustworthy DL systems.

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant
threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires
increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also
reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;
however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its
predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To
address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that
jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance
short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our
best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected
Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both
predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of
the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision
support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting
low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire
danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast
horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with
time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic
uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty
types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary
insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their
joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger
forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: VSSFlow unifies video-to-sound (V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) generation in a single flow-matching framework with novel condition aggregation using cross-attention for video and self-attention for transcripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches treat V2S and VisualTTS as separate tasks with complex training stages, lacking a unified framework that can handle heterogeneous video and transcript conditions efficiently.

Method: VSSFlow uses flow-matching with condition aggregation mechanism: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and self-attention for deterministic speech transcripts, enabling end-to-end joint training without complex strategies.

Result: VSSFlow surpasses state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S and VisualTTS benchmarks, benefiting from learned general audio prior that accelerates convergence and stabilizes generation.

Conclusion: Unified generative models like VSSFlow show critical potential for handling multiple audio generation tasks, with joint training providing benefits through shared audio priors rather than performance degradation.

Abstract: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound
(V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed
as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle
framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in
handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript
conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks
remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which
seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching
framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle
distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer
exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition.
Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle
different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and
self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary
to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex
training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits
from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation
without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to
the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates
convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the
classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S
and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified
generative models.

Conclusion: AISHELL6-Whisper dataset and the proposed AVSR baseline effectively address the lack of resources for Chinese Mandarin whisper speech recognition, achieving strong performance and setting new benchmarks in the field.

Conclusion: The CWT-YOLO pipeline provides highly accurate fault diagnosis with direct visualization of fault locations, offering a practical solution for rotating machinery condition monitoring.

Abstract: This letter proposes a YOLO-based framework for spatial bearing fault
diagnosis using time-frequency spectrograms derived from continuous wavelet
transform (CWT). One-dimensional vibration signals are first transformed into
time-frequency spectrograms using Morlet wavelets to capture transient fault
signatures. These spectrograms are then processed by YOLOv9, v10, and v11
models to classify fault types. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets,
including Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn University (PU),
and Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS), the proposed CWT-YOLO pipeline
achieves significantly higher accuracy and generalizability than the baseline
MCNN-LSTM model. Notably, YOLOv11 reaches mAP scores of 99.4% (CWRU), 97.8%
(PU), and 99.5% (IMS). In addition, its region-aware detection mechanism
enables direct visualization of fault locations in spectrograms, offering a
practical solution for condition monitoring in rotating machinery.

*Jianheng Zhou,Chenyu Liu,Jinan Zhou,Yi Ding,Yang Liu,Haoran Luo,Ziyu Jia,Xinliang Zhou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A new sleep staging method that converts 1D PSG signals to 2D waveform images and fine-tunes multimodal large models, achieving superior performance by mimicking clinical visual diagnosis workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic sleep staging methods lack intuitiveness and require large specialized datasets, while clinical practices rely on visual waveform analysis that is more intuitive.

Method: Convert raw PSG time-series into 2D waveform images and fine-tune multimodal large models to learn from these visual representations, emulating clinical diagnostic practices.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three public datasets (ISRUC, MASS, SHHS) in accuracy and robustness, with explanation analysis showing the model learned to mimic human expert visual diagnostic workflows.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm enables general-purpose models to acquire robust sleep staging capabilities without prior sleep data exposure, offering efficient and practical value for medical applications.

Abstract: Sleep staging is essential for diagnosing sleep disorders and assessing
neurological health. Existing automatic methods typically extract features from
complex polysomnography (PSG) signals and train domain-specific models, which
often lack intuitiveness and require large, specialized datasets. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm for sleep staging that leverages
large multimodal general-purpose models to emulate clinical diagnostic
practices. Specifically, we convert raw one-dimensional PSG time-series into
intuitive two-dimensional waveform images and then fine-tune a multimodal large
model to learn from these representations. Experiments on three public datasets
(ISRUC, MASS, SHHS) demonstrate that our approach enables general-purpose
models, without prior exposure to sleep data, to acquire robust staging
capabilities. Moreover, explanation analysis reveals our model learned to mimic
the visual diagnostic workflow of human experts for sleep staging by PSG
images. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in accuracy and robustness, highlighting its efficiency and practical value for
medical applications. The code for the signal-to-image pipeline and the PSG
image dataset will be released.

### [687] [Beyond Game Theory Optimal: Profit-Maximizing Poker Agents for No-Limit Holdem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23747)
*SeungHyun Yi,Seungjun Yi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: A poker AI model that combines GTO strategies with opponent exploitation to maximize profits in both heads-up and multi-way No Limit Holdem, outperforming pure GTO approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pure GTO strategies avoid losses but don't guarantee maximum profit. The goal is to develop a model that outperforms GTO by exploiting opponents to maximize winnings.

Method: The model first creates a strong GTO baseline through self-play simulation (Monte-Carlo CFR), then adapts by observing opponent behavior and adjusting strategy to exploit weaknesses.

Result: Monte-Carlo CFR performs best in heads-up situations and remains strongest in most multi-way situations. The combined approach shows consistent winning against diverse opponents.

Conclusion: Combining GTO's defensive strength with real-time exploitation enables poker agents to move from merely avoiding losses to consistently winning, demonstrating superior performance over pure GTO strategies.

Abstract: Game theory has grown into a major field over the past few decades, and poker
has long served as one of its key case studies. Game-Theory-Optimal (GTO)
provides strategies to avoid loss in poker, but pure GTO does not guarantee
maximum profit. To this end, we aim to develop a model that outperforms GTO
strategies to maximize profit in No Limit Holdem, in heads-up (two-player) and
multi-way (more than two-player) situations. Our model finds the GTO foundation
and goes further to exploit opponents. The model first navigates toward many
simulated poker hands against itself and keeps adjusting its decisions until no
action can reliably beat it, creating a strong baseline that is close to the
theoretical best strategy. Then, it adapts by observing opponent behavior and
adjusting its strategy to capture extra value accordingly. Our results indicate
that Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) performs best in
heads-up situations and CFR remains the strongest method in most multi-way
situations. By combining the defensive strength of GTO with real-time
exploitation, our approach aims to show how poker agents can move from merely
not losing to consistently winning against diverse opponents.

*Irsyad Adam,Zekai Chen,David Laub,Shaun Porwal,Arda Pekis,Kevin Brown*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper introduces CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction tuning dataset for molecular understanding in oncology, and KRONOS, a graph-LLM framework that integrates molecular interaction topology with proteomics data for enhanced clinical reasoning in cancer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proteomics data is crucial for understanding disease phenotypes in cancer, enabling precision medicine. However, current multimodal LLMs face challenges in molecular understanding of patient-specific proteomics due to lack of instruction-tuning datasets and appropriate architectures for molecular data heterogeneity.

Method: Created CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT dataset with 400k+ open-ended examples from CPTAC proteomic profiles. Developed KRONOS, a novel graph-LLM framework that leverages molecular interaction topology with proteomics to learn patient-specific graph representations.

Result: KRONOS achieves competitive performance across clinical tasks including molecular classification, temporal trajectory modeling, and tumor stage prediction from proteomics data.

Conclusion: This approach enables LLMs to understand patient-level pathogenesis, advancing precision medicine through more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment stratification.

Abstract: Proteomics data is essential to pathogenic understanding of a disease
phenotype. In cancer, analysis of molecular signatures enables precision
medicine through the identification of biological processes that drive
individualized tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and clinical
heterogeneity. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capacity to integrate and reason across heterogeneous data
modalities. However, performing multi-modal language modeling for molecular
understanding of patient-specific proteomics remains a significant challenge
due to two barriers: (1) the lack of instruction-tuning datasets that enable
clinical interpretation from proteomics data, and (2) the absence of language
modeling architectures designed to capture the rich heterogeneity of molecular
data. In this work, we introduce CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction tuning
dataset for molecular understanding of oncology, comprising over 400k
open-ended examples derived from individualized proteomic profiles curated from
the largest national proteomics cancer study (CPTAC). Additionally, we propose
KRONOS (Knowledge Representation of patient Omics Networks in Oncology via
Structured tuning), a novel graph-LLM framework that leverages molecular
interaction topology with proteomics to learn patient-specific graph
representations for enhanced clinical reasoning. We show that KRONOS achieves
competitive performance across benchmark clinical tasks, including molecular
classification, temporal trajectory modeling, and tumor stage prediction from
proteomics data. Ultimately, this approach empowers LLMs to understand
patient-level pathogenesis, advancing precision medicine through more accurate
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment stratification.

### [689] [Metamorphic Testing for Audio Content Moderation Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24215)
*Wenxuan Wang,Yongjiang Wu,Junyuan Zhang,Shuqing Li,Yun Peng,Wenting Chen,Shuai Wang,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MTAM is a metamorphic testing framework for audio content moderation software that generates adversarial audio test cases to evaluate system robustness against evasion attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio platforms are increasingly misused to spread harmful content, and existing moderation tools can be bypassed through subtle audio modifications, but their effectiveness against such adversarial inputs is understudied.

Method: Developed MTAM framework with 14 metamorphic relations across Audio Features-Based and Heuristic perturbation categories, applied to toxic audio to generate test cases that remain harmful but evade detection.

Result: MTAM achieved error finding rates up to 38.6%, 18.3%, 35.1%, 16.7%, and 51.1% for commercial software from Gladia, Assembly AI, Baidu, Nextdata, and Tencent respectively, and up to 45.7% for academic models.

Conclusion: MTAM effectively identifies vulnerabilities in audio content moderation systems, demonstrating significant gaps in current tools' robustness against adversarial audio modifications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of audio-centric platforms and applications such as WhatsApp
and Twitter has transformed the way people communicate and share audio content
in modern society. However, these platforms are increasingly misused to
disseminate harmful audio content, such as hate speech, deceptive
advertisements, and explicit material, which can have significant negative
consequences (e.g., detrimental effects on mental health). In response,
researchers and practitioners have been actively developing and deploying audio
content moderation tools to tackle this issue. Despite these efforts, malicious
actors can bypass moderation systems by making subtle alterations to audio
content, such as modifying pitch or inserting noise. Moreover, the
effectiveness of modern audio moderation tools against such adversarial inputs
remains insufficiently studied. To address these challenges, we propose MTAM, a
Metamorphic Testing framework for Audio content Moderation software.
Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2000 audio clips and define 14
metamorphic relations across two perturbation categories: Audio Features-Based
and Heuristic perturbations. MTAM applies these metamorphic relations to toxic
audio content to generate test cases that remain harmful while being more
likely to evade detection. In our evaluation, we employ MTAM to test five
commercial textual content moderation software and an academic model against
three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTAM achieves up to 38.6%,
18.3%, 35.1%, 16.7%, and 51.1% error finding rates (EFR) when testing
commercial moderation software provided by Gladia, Assembly AI, Baidu,
Nextdata, and Tencent, respectively, and it obtains up to 45.7% EFR when
testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy.

### [690] [DiffTester: Accelerating Unit Test Generation for Diffusion LLMs via Repetitive Pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24975)
*Lekang Yang,Yuetong Liu,Yitong Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DiffTester is an acceleration framework for diffusion LLMs in unit test generation that identifies repetitive structural patterns in test cases to enable parallel token generation without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs generate test cases inefficiently one token at a time, while diffusion LLMs offer parallel generation but suffer from quality-efficiency trade-offs when generating multiple tokens per step.

Method: Dynamically identifies common structural patterns in unit tests through abstract syntax tree analysis during generation, allowing adaptive increase in tokens per step while maintaining output quality.

Result: Significant acceleration while preserving test coverage across three benchmarks with two representative models, and generalizes well across different dLLMs and programming languages.

Conclusion: DiffTester provides a practical and scalable solution for efficient unit test generation in software development, overcoming the efficiency-quality trade-off in diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on extensive unit testing, which makes
the efficiency of automated Unit Test Generation (UTG) particularly important.
However, most existing LLMs generate test cases one token at a time in each
forward pass, which leads to inefficient UTG. Recently, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs)
have emerged, offering promising parallel generation capabilities and showing
strong potential for efficient UTG. Despite this advantage, their application
to UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test
quality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often
causes a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this
limitation, we present DiffTester, an acceleration framework specifically
tailored for dLLMs in UTG. The key idea of DiffTester is that unit tests
targeting the same focal method often share repetitive structural patterns. By
dynamically identifying these common patterns through abstract syntax tree
analysis during generation, DiffTester adaptively increases the number of
tokens produced at each step without compromising the quality of the output. To
enable comprehensive evaluation, we extend the original TestEval benchmark,
which was limited to Python, by introducing additional programming languages
including Java and C++. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two
representative models show that DiffTester delivers significant acceleration
while preserving test coverage. Moreover, DiffTester generalizes well across
different dLLMs and programming languages, providing a practical and scalable
solution for efficient UTG in software development. Code and data are publicly
available at https://github.com/wellbeingyang/DLM4UTG-open .

Abstract: The advent of transformers has in recent years led to powerful and
revolutionary Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this, our understanding on
the capability of transformers is still meager. In this invited contribution,
we recount the rapid progress in the last few years to the question of what
transformers can do. In particular, we will see the integral role of logic and
automata (also with some help from circuit complexity) in answering this

*Changde Du,Yizhuo Lu,Zhongyu Huang,Yi Sun,Zisen Zhou,Shaozheng Qin,Huiguang He*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Using AI models to collect emotion similarity judgments from videos reveals that multimodal models develop neurally-aligned affective representations that better predict brain activity than human ratings or language-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the 'behavior-neural gap' where human self-reports poorly predict brain activity, and test if large-scale similarity judgments can better capture the brain's affective geometry.

Method: Collected millions of triplet odd-one-out judgments from multimodal (MLLM) and language-only (LLM) AI models using 2,180 emotionally evocative videos, then analyzed the emergent 30-dimensional embeddings.

Result: MLLM's representation predicted neural activity in human emotion-processing networks with highest accuracy, outperforming both LLM and human behavioral ratings. MLLM embeddings were interpretable and organized emotions categorically with dimensional properties.

Conclusion: Sensory grounding through visual data is critical for developing neurally-aligned emotion representations. MLLMs can autonomously develop rich affective frameworks that bridge subjective experience and neural substrates.

Abstract: The ability to represent emotion plays a significant role in human cognition
and social interaction, yet the high-dimensional geometry of this affective
space and its neural underpinnings remain debated. A key challenge, the
`behavior-neural gap,' is the limited ability of human self-reports to predict
brain activity. Here we test the hypothesis that this gap arises from the
constraints of traditional rating scales and that large-scale similarity
judgments can more faithfully capture the brain's affective geometry. Using AI
models as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out
judgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only
model (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos. We found that
the emergent 30-dimensional embeddings from these models are highly
interpretable and organize emotion primarily along categorical lines, yet in a
blended fashion that incorporates dimensional properties. Most remarkably, the
MLLM's representation predicted neural activity in human emotion-processing
networks with the highest accuracy, outperforming not only the LLM but also,
counterintuitively, representations derived directly from human behavioral
ratings. This result supports our primary hypothesis and suggests that sensory
grounding--learning from rich visual data--is critical for developing a truly
neurally-aligned conceptual framework for emotion. Our findings provide
compelling evidence that MLLMs can autonomously develop rich, neurally-aligned
affective representations, offering a powerful paradigm to bridge the gap
between subjective experience and its neural substrates. Project page:

### [694] [TraitSpaces: Towards Interpretable Visual Creativity for Human-AI Co-Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24326)
*Prerna Luthra*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A framework for modeling visual creativity across four domains using 12 psychologically grounded traits, evaluated on 20k artworks with GPT-4.1 annotations and CLIP embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge cultural-aesthetic insights with computational modeling, providing shared language and interpretable tools for artists, researchers, and AI systems to collaborate meaningfully on creativity.

Method: Interviews with artists and psychology theories define 12 creativity traits; GPT-4.1 annotates 20k SemArt artworks; CLIP image embeddings predict traits; visualize "creativity trait-space" for co-creation.

Result: Some traits like Environmental Dialogicity and Redemptive Arc predicted reliably (R² ≈ 0.64-0.68), while others like Memory Imprint remain challenging, showing limits of visual encoding alone.

Conclusion: The framework offers interpretable tools for trait-aware co-creation without reducing creativity to numbers, enabling meaningful collaboration between artists, researchers, and AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce a psychologically grounded and artist-informed framework for
modeling visual creativity across four domains: Inner, Outer, Imaginative, and
Moral Worlds. Drawing on interviews with practicing artists and theories from
psychology, we define 12 traits that capture affective, symbolic, cultural, and
ethical dimensions of creativity.Using 20k artworks from the SemArt dataset, we
annotate images with GPT 4.1 using detailed, theory-aligned prompts, and
evaluate the learnability of these traits from CLIP image embeddings. Traits
such as Environmental Dialogicity and Redemptive Arc are predicted with high
reliability ($R^2 \approx 0.64 - 0.68$), while others like Memory Imprint
remain challenging, highlighting the limits of purely visual encoding. Beyond
technical metrics, we visualize a "creativity trait-space" and illustrate how
it can support interpretable, trait-aware co-creation - e.g., sliding along a
Redemptive Arc axis to explore works of adversity and renewal. By linking
cultural-aesthetic insights with computational modeling, our work aims not to
reduce creativity to numbers, but to offer shared language and interpretable
tools for artists, researchers, and AI systems to collaborate meaningfully.
