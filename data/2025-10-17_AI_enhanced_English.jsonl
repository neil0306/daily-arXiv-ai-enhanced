While prior work has shown\nthat merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models\nfor each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into\nlow-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or\npost-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that\napplying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe\nperformance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we\npropose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters\ninto one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of\nholding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be\nrecovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a\nreconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.\nCrucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,\nrecognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized\nfor its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible\nModel Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides\na closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and\ntask-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms\nexisting merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed\nmodels by a significant margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "Reversible Model Merging (RMM) addresses performance degradation in merging low-rank compressed models by creating a compact basis that allows recovery of original task-specific models via linear combination, outperforming conventional merging methods.", "motivation": "Conventional model merging methods fail when applied to low-rank compressed models (LoRA or SVD), causing severe performance degradation.

Recent efforts in pretraining\nhave demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language\nmodeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we\nexamine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language\nmodels. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing\nsampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by\ndecoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states\nof these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.\nTheoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the\nbaseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern\nhardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion\nliterature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth\ntransformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,\nour findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the\nextra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that\nsuch models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,\ndiffusion language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a diffusion forcing sampler that accelerates generation in recurrent-depth language models by enabling parallel token refinement through recurrence, achieving up to 5x speedup without tuning.", "motivation": "To bridge the gap between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language models, leveraging their similarities to develop more efficient generation methods that can utilize the extra computation in recurrent models during inference.", "method": "Developed a diffusion forcing sampler that decodes new tokens at every forward pass while allowing parallel refinement of latent states through recurrence, based on principles from diffusion literature.", "result": "The sampler provides strictly more expressive generation than baseline autoregressive methods with the same time budget, achieving up to 5x speedup when applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth transformers without any tuning.", "conclusion": "Recurrent-depth models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal, diffusion language models, and the proposed sampler provides an efficient mechanism for parallelizing their extra computation at inference."}}
