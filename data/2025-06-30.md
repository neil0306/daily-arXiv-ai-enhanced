### [1] [Efficient Multilingual ASR Finetuning via LoRA Language Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21555)
*Jiahong Li,Yiwen Shao,Jianheng Zhuo,Chenda Li,Liliang Tang,Dong Yu,Yanmin Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A finetuning framework using LoRA language experts improves multilingual ASR performance over standard methods, achieving 10-15% gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual ASR faces interference between languages, hindering effective model performance.

Method: Proposes LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation based on Whisper for efficient finetuning.

Result: 10% and 15% relative performance gains in language-aware and language-agnostic scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enhances multilingual ASR by mitigating language interference.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced multilingual
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to the development of advanced model
architectures and available large-scale multilingual datasets. Despite that,
multilingual ASR still suffers from the curse of multilinguality in that
different languages tend to interfere with each other, making it difficult for
the ASR model to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model
capacity across them. This paper proposes an efficient finetuning framework for
customized multilingual ASR via prepared LoRA language experts based on
Whisper. Through LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation, our approach
achieves better recognition performance on target languages than standard
fine-tuning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models
yield approximately 10\% and 15\% relative performance gains in language-aware
and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

### [2] [VAT-KG: Knowledge-Intensive Multimodal Knowledge Graph Dataset for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21556)
*Hyeongcheol Park,MinHyuk Jang,Ha Dam Baek,Gyusam Chang,Jiyoung Seo,Jiwan Park,Hogun Park,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAT-KG, a multimodal knowledge graph covering visual, audio, and text, addressing limitations of existing MMKGs by enabling broader knowledge coverage and richer modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMKGs are limited in scope, outdated, and lack support for newer modalities like video and audio, reducing their applicability.

Method: Proposes VAT-KG, a concept-centric MMKG with cross-modal alignment, constructed via stringent filtering and alignment steps. Introduces a multimodal RAG framework for retrieval.

Result: VAT-KG effectively supports MLLMs in multimodal question answering, demonstrating its practical value.

Conclusion: VAT-KG advances MMKGs by unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge, enhancing MLLM performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge
across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit
knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more
grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting
pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in
outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow
range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations
reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal
tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video
and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text
Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive
multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,
where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed
descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures
cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained
semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling
the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further
introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed
concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities.
Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate
the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical
value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

### [3] [Debunk and Infer: Multimodal Fake News Detection via Diffusion-Generated Evidence and LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21557)
*Kaiying Yan,Moyang Liu,Yukun Liu,Ruibo Fu,Zhengqi Wen,Jianhua Tao,Xuefei Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework called DIFND combines debunking knowledge, conditional diffusion models, and multimodal large language models to improve fake news detection accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid spread of fake news challenges information credibility, necessitating better detection methods.

Method: DIFND uses debunk diffusion for evidence generation and a chain-of-debunk strategy with multi-agent MLLMs for reasoning and verification.

Result: DIFND outperforms existing methods on FakeSV and FVC datasets, providing trustworthy decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances fake news detection by integrating generative and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious
challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a
Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages
debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional
diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to
generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of
news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically
aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk
strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded,
multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly
modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich
verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements
in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets
show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers
trustworthy decisions.

### [4] [Bench to the Future: A Pastcasting Benchmark for Forecasting Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21558)
*FutureSearch,:,Jack Wildman,Nikos I. Bosse,Daniel Hnyk,Peter MÃ¼hlbacher,Finn Hambly,Jon Evans,Dan Schwarz,Lawrence Phillips*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BTF is a 'pastcasting' benchmark for LLMs, using known-outcome questions and offline web data to simulate forecasting. It aims to provide a realistic, repeatable environment for evaluating forecasting capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forecasting benchmarks lack realism and repeatability for LLMs. BTF addresses this by using past events with known outcomes and offline data.

Method: BTF uses hundreds of high-quality questions with known resolutions and large offline web corpora. It evaluates LLMs like Claude 4 using agent and chain-of-thought approaches.

Result: BTF produces results comparable to real-time forecasting and tracks progress in forecasting capabilities over time.

Conclusion: BTF is a living benchmark for realistic LLM forecasting evaluation, with plans for continuous updates and community involvement.

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to
study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the
internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the
development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting
benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM
forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark
with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already
known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of
thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts"
on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can
produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on
at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and
chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the
recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track
steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living
benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing
training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at
hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own
research.

### [5] [GraphLAMA: Enabling Efficient Adaptation of Graph Language Models with Limited Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21559)
*Junze Chen,Cheng Yang,Shujie Li,Zhiqiang Zhang,Yawen Li,Junping Du,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphLAMA, a method to improve graph language models (GLMs) by adding a parameter adaptation stage, addressing limitations of in-context learning (ICL) and instruction tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL on graphs has effectiveness and efficiency issues, while instruction tuning requires large labeled datasets. The goal is to enable efficient adaptation of GLMs to unseen tasks with few labeled examples.

Method: Proposes GraphLAMA, using a GNN backbone to transform nodes into LLM token representations. Includes pre-training for general knowledge and adaptation for few-shot learning.

Result: GraphLAMA achieves a 4.91% accuracy improvement and 10x faster inference speed compared to ICL under 5-shot settings.

Conclusion: GraphLAMA effectively addresses the limitations of existing GLM approaches, offering better accuracy and efficiency for few-shot graph tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in
various domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph
language models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret
unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in
the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).
Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model
performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs
has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to
long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for
instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this
end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can
efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled
examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference
speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its
model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and
inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network
(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the
representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented
as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model
parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture
general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters
will be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on
few/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed
GraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution
improvement in accuracy. Compared with ICL, our inference speed can be 10 times
faster under 5-shot setting.

### [6] [Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning of Language Model for Instruction Following and Math Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21560)
*Yifu Han,Geo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates RL fine-tuning techniques (SFT, DPO, RLOO) on Qwen2.5-0.5B Base for instruction following and math reasoning. RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling performs best, while DPO is consistent. Synthetic data and best-of-N sampling boost math task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore effective RL fine-tuning methods for aligning compact language models with challenging tasks like instruction following and mathematical reasoning.

Method: Compared SFT, DPO, and RLOO with reward models. Used synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling for math tasks.

Result: RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieved the best alignment. DPO was strong and consistent. Synthetic data and best-of-N sampling improved math task accuracy.

Conclusion: The study identifies practical strategies and trade-offs for fine-tuning lightweight, task-aligned small-scale language models.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two
challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models.
Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best
alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing
tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external
verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining
fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and
practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale
language models.

### [7] [Reasoning Isn't Enough: Examining Truth-Bias and Sycophancy in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21561)
*Emilio Barkett,Olivia Long,Madhavendra Thakur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs' truth-judgment capabilities, finding reasoning models less truth-biased than non-reasoning ones but still flawed, with advanced models showing sycophantic tendencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' effectiveness in truth detection, given their critical role in fact-checking and decision-making.

Method: Evaluated 8 LLMs on 4,800 veracity judgments, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models.

Result: Reasoning models showed lower truth-bias but still underperformed humans; advanced models exhibited sycophantic tendencies.

Conclusion: Capability improvements alone don't address core veracity detection issues in LLMs.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as
judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs'
veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in
reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across
several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that
rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true,
regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than
in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most
concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models
(o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an
asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly
in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not
resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

### [8] [FloorPlan-DeepSeek (FPDS): A multimodal approach to floorplan generation using vector-based next room prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21562)
*Jun Yin,Pengyu Zeng,Jing Zhong,Peilin Li,Miao Zhang,Ran Luo,Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 'next room prediction' paradigm for floor plan generation, inspired by autoregressive models, to better align with incremental architectural workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for floor plans are end-to-end, which conflicts with the iterative nature of real-world architectural design.

Method: Proposes a 'next room prediction' approach, inspired by autoregressive language models, for incremental floor plan generation.

Result: FPDS shows competitive performance against diffusion models and Tell2Design in text-to-floorplan tasks.

Conclusion: The method has potential for supporting intelligent architectural design by aligning with real-world workflows.

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently
progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans
are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based
layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the
incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address
this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction'
mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next
room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling.
Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive
performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the
text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting
future intelligent architectural design.

### [9] [FormosanBench: Benchmarking Low-Resource Austronesian Languages in the Era of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21563)
*Kaiying Kevin Lin,Hsiyu Chen,Haopeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FORMOSANBENCH is introduced as the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on low-resource Austronesian languages, revealing significant performance gaps and limited improvements with existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored capabilities of LLMs in low-resource and endangered languages like Formosan languages, which are linguistically rich but sociolinguistically dominated by Mandarin.

Method: FORMOSANBENCH evaluates LLMs on three endangered Formosan languages (Atayal, Amis, Paiwan) across machine translation, ASR, and text summarization, using zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings.

Result: LLMs underperform significantly in Formosan languages, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning providing only marginal improvements.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for more inclusive NLP technologies to support endangered languages and releases datasets/code to encourage further research.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in high-resource
languages, their capabilities in low-resource and minority languages remain
significantly underexplored. Formosan languages -- a subgroup of Austronesian
languages spoken in Taiwan -- are both linguistically rich and endangered,
largely due to the sociolinguistic dominance of Mandarin. In this work, we
introduce FORMOSANBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
low-resource Austronesian languages. It covers three endangered Formosan
languages: Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan, across three core NLP tasks: machine
translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text summarization. We
assess model performance in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings using
FORMOSANBENCH. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap between
high-resource and Formosan languages. Existing LLMs consistently underperform
across all tasks, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning offering only limited
improvements. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive NLP
technologies that can effectively support endangered and underrepresented
languages. We release our datasets and code to facilitate future research in
this direction.

*Jiyan Liu,Youzheng Liu,Taihang Wang,Xiaoman Xu,Yimin Wang,Ye Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QUST_NLP's three-stage retrieval framework for fact-checked claim retrieval achieved 5th (monolingual) and 7th (crosslingual) in SemEval-2025 Task 7.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve retrieval performance for fact-checked claims in SemEval-2025 Task 7.

Method: A three-stage framework: candidate retrieval (best model selected), re-ranking (Top-10 results per model), and weighted voting for final outcomes.

Result: Ranked 5th in monolingual and 7th in crosslingual tracks.

Conclusion: The framework is effective, with code publicly available for further use.

Abstract: This paper describes the participation of QUST_NLP in the SemEval-2025 Task
7. We propose a three-stage retrieval framework specifically designed for
fact-checked claim retrieval. Initially, we evaluate the performance of several
retrieval models and select the one that yields the best results for candidate
retrieval. Next, we employ multiple re-ranking models to enhance the candidate
results, with each model selecting the Top-10 outcomes. In the final stage, we
utilize weighted voting to determine the final retrieval outcomes. Our approach
achieved 5th place in the monolingual track and 7th place in the crosslingual
track. We release our system code at:

### [11] [A Multi-Agent Probabilistic Inference Framework Inspired by Kairanban-Style CoT System with IdoBata Conversation for Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21565)
*Takato Ueno,Keito Inoshita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-agent inference framework (KCS+IBC) inspired by Japan's kairanban and idobata cultures to improve sentiment analysis by mitigating bias, enhancing explainability, and enabling probabilistic prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by traditional Japanese communication practices (kairanban and idobata) that foster nuanced dialogue and social balance, the study aims to replicate these benefits in sentiment analysis using LLMs.

Method: The KCS+IBC framework integrates multiple LLMs, includes a mid-phase casual dialogue session, and introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction to blend formal inference with individual perspectives.

Result: KCS matches single LLM accuracy, while KCS+IBC reduces entropy and increases variance in later inference stages, balancing prediction aggregation and diversity.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for bias correction and improved sentiment analysis, with future work focusing on quantifying its impact and advancing the system.

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as
traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among
community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired
by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent
inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models
(LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic
prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing
prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual
dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and
introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that
KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while
KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in
variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's
ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will
quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction
and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

### [12] [The Saturation Point of Backtranslation in High Quality Low Resource English Gujarati Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21566)
*Arwa Arif*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Backtranslation (BT) in low-resource English-Gujarati MT using MBART50 shows no improvement despite careful filtering of synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess BT's effectiveness in high-quality, low-resource MT settings, specifically for English-Gujarati.

Method: Augmented a 50K-sentence parallel corpus with filtered BT-generated data from monolingual Gujarati text, using MBART50.

Result: Adding BT data did not improve performance (BLEU 43.8 baseline) and sometimes slightly reduced it.

Conclusion: BT may have diminishing returns in certain low-resource settings, warranting further research.

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to
generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While
this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its
effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this
work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati
translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline
system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000
sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment
this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from
monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not
improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We
evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and
analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that
backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain
low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

### [13] [BioPars: A Pretrained Biomedical Large Language Model for Persian Biomedical Text Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21567)
*Baqer M. Merzah,Tania Taami,Salman Asoudeh,Amir reza Hossein pour,Saeed Mirzaee,Amir Ali Bengari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BioPars, a tool for evaluating LLMs in bioinformatics, using datasets like BIOPARS-BENCH and BioParsQA. It highlights LLMs' strengths in knowledge retrieval but notes limitations in complex reasoning, showing BioPars outperforms models like GPT-4 in Persian medical QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capabilities in bioinformatics, particularly for Persian medical QA, and address gaps in higher-level reasoning and fine-grained inferences.

Method: Developed BioPars, a measure for evaluating LLMs on subject-specific knowledge, synthesis, and evidence demonstration, using datasets like BIOPARS-BENCH and BioParsQA. Compared models like ChatGPT, Llama, and Galactica.

Result: BioPars outperformed comparative models (e.g., GPT-4) with a ROUGE-L score of 29.99, BERTScore of 90.87, and higher MoverScore (60.43) and BLEURT (50.78).

Conclusion: BioPars demonstrates LLMs' potential in Persian medical QA but highlights the need for fine-tuning to improve complex reasoning. The project is ongoing and open-source.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life
sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological
information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are
increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized
fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset
from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.
BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of
5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces
BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main
abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing
such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,
and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve
learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,
real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the
need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in
bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM
in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of
four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable
results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a
ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model
achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT
values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition,
the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78.
BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will
be made available via the following GitHub repository:

### [14] [Assessing RAG and HyDE on 1B vs. 4B-Parameter Gemma LLMs for Personal Assistants Integretion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21568)
*Andrejs Sorstkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates RAG and HyDE augmentation strategies on compact Gemma LLMs (1B and 4B parameters) for privacy-first personal assistants. RAG reduces latency and hallucinations, while HyDE improves semantic relevance but increases response time and hallucinations. RAG is recommended for small-scale LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource efficiency is a barrier for deploying LLMs in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study aims to evaluate augmentation strategies to address this challenge.

Method: Implemented RAG and HyDE on Gemma LLMs (1B and 4B parameters) with MongoDB for short-term memory and Qdrant for long-term storage, orchestrated via FastAPI and LangChain, and exposed through a React.js frontend.

Result: RAG reduced latency by up to 17% and eliminated hallucinations. HyDE improved semantic relevance but increased response time (25-40%) and hallucination rates. Scaling to 4B models magnified HyDE's overhead.

Conclusion: RAG is the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants using small-scale LLMs due to its efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models
(LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the
efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion
and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal
assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic
storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the
system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently
reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when
responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast,
enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but
incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination
rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that
scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but
magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position
RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by
small-scale LLMs.

*Weihua Xiao,Derek Ekberg,Siddharth Garg,Ramesh Karri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and synthetic fine-tuning improves LLM performance in translating natural language to SystemVerilog Assertions (NL2SVA), achieving significant accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual translation of natural language to SystemVerilog Assertions (NL2SVA) is labor-intensive and error-prone, prompting the need for automated solutions using LLMs.

Method: Proposes a customized RAG framework and synthetic fine-tuning dataset with prompt-guided explanations to enhance LLM understanding of domain-specific syntax and semantics.

Result: The framework improves functionality-matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini and 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

Conclusion: The approach significantly enhances LLM performance in NL2SVA, offering a scalable solution for hardware design verification.

Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of
hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property
descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate
this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding
domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we
propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a
synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To
further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset
provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer
construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that
greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance
of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA,
comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed
annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework
increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini,
while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and
integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

*Roland Riachi,Kashif Rasul,Arjun Ashok,Prateek Humane,Alexis Roger,Andrew R. Williams,Yuriy Nevmyvaka,Irina Rish*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores effective transfer learning from pre-trained language models (LMs) to time series forecasting, analyzing design choices like post-training, tokenizers, and model size. It highlights a persistent transfer gap and provides insights for compute-efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how pre-trained LMs can be effectively adapted for time series forecasting, especially in low-data scenarios, and to analyze the impact of various design choices.

Method: Analyzes transfer learning from LMs to time series forecasting by evaluating upstream post-training, time series tokenizers, and language backbone size.

Result: Design choices significantly impact validation loss, with clear optimal choices. A non-vanishing transfer gap persists, unlike prior findings.

Conclusion: The study offers insights for efficient training and suggests further research into modality-agnostic properties of data distributions.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained
language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We
build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language
models to time series forecasting under various design choices including
upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In
the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the
validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to
Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs
continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly
initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that
holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the
effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the
way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions
leveraged by these models.

### [17] [Towards Understanding the Cognitive Habits of Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21571)
*Jianshuo Dong,Yujia Fu,Chuanrui Hu,Chao Zhang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogTest, a benchmark to evaluate cognitive habits in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), revealing they exhibit human-like habits and adapt them task-specifically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like cognitive habits, inspired by observed CoT patterns and the Habits of Mind framework.

Method: Developed CogTest with 16 cognitive habits, each tested on 25 tasks, using an evidence-first extraction method to evaluate 16 LLMs (13 LRMs, 3 non-reasoning).

Result: LRMs show human-like habits, adapt them task-specifically, and exhibit inter-family similarities. Certain habits correlate with harmful responses in safety tasks.

Conclusion: Studying CoT behavioral patterns in LRMs aids understanding of LLM misbehavior, with CogTest providing a valuable tool for evaluation.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain
of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach
to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation
that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --
consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like
cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of
cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce
CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.
CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,
and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit
identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that
LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also
adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses
further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit
profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and
DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that
certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with
the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying
persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper
understanding of LLM misbehavior. The code is available at:

*Tianyu. Zou,Shengwu. Xiong,Ruilin. Yao,Jirui. Huang,Yi. Rong,Yaxiong. Chen,Shili. Xiong,Cong. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)-based framework to improve MLLM benchmarks, addressing issues like redundancy and lack of interpretability. It introduces a cognitive hierarchy (Perception, Memory, Reasoning) and a new benchmark, Gold, showing better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks lack structured, interpretable designs, leading to overlapping abilities and limited diagnostic power.

Method: Uses SEM to align benchmarks, introduces a cognitive hierarchy (Perception, Memory, Reasoning), and constructs the Gold benchmark.

Result: Gold benchmark shows improved interpretability, reduced redundancy, and clearer cognitive consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and benchmark offer a more valid and interpretable approach to evaluating MLLMs.

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental
challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically
grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based
task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping
abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity,
dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated
by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel
capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development,
dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception,
Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the
proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger
interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive
consistency compared to existing approaches.

*Yanwei Ren,Liu Liu,Baosheng Yu,Jiayan Qiu,Quan Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework combines black-box and white-box models to optimize LLM instructions, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of standalone white-box (high resource demand) and black-box (high cost) approaches for LLM instruction optimization.

Method: Merges black-box models for diverse initializations with white-box models for interpretability, using semantic similarity constraints for unified representation and iterative refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across tasks like complex reasoning and cross-lingual generalization.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, efficient solution for next-gen LLM applications, with source code to be released.

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for
harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying
solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and
offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur
prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box
models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box
models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output
features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse
into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and
structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine
instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad
spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual
generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with
advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving
the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

*Yicheng Mao,Yang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores using LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for immigration decision-making, finding they align with human strategies but still exhibit biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the workload and fairness challenges in immigration decision-making by leveraging AI.

Method: Mixed-methods approach: discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews to analyze LLM decision-making.

Result: LLMs align with human strategies (utility maximization, fairness) but show biases toward privileged groups and nationalities.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential for immigration decisions but require addressing biases to ensure fairness.

Abstract: With globalization and increasing immigrant populations, immigration
departments face significant work-loads and the challenge of ensuring fairness
in decision-making processes. Integrating artificial intelligence offers a
promising solution to these challenges. This study investigates the potential
of large language models (LLMs),such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in supporting
immigration decision-making. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach,this paper
conducted discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews to study LLM
decision-making strategies and whether they are fair. Our findings demonstrate
that LLMs can align their decision-making with human strategies, emphasizing
utility maximization and procedural fairness. Meanwhile, this paper also
reveals that while ChatGPT has safeguards to prevent unintentional
discrimination, it still exhibits stereotypes and biases concerning nationality
and shows preferences toward privileged group. This dual analysis highlights
both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automating and enhancing
immigration decisions.

*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Lawrence Phillips,Casper Hansen,Julien Fauqueur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STRuCT-LLM is a framework for training LLMs to perform structured reasoning on relational and graph data, using RL and CoT supervision. It improves performance on Text-to-SQL and Text-to-Cypher tasks and shows zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify structured reasoning over relational and graph data, leveraging shared abstractions between SQL and Cypher for cross-formalism transfer.

Method: Combines reinforcement learning with Chain-of-Thought supervision and introduces a topology-aware reward function for graph-based parsing.

Result: Achieves significant improvements: 13.5% on Spider, 73.1% on Text2Cypher, and demonstrates zero-shot generalization on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Executable queries are effective scaffolds for structured reasoning, and joint training on SQL and Cypher yields synergistic benefits.

Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models
(LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and
graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and
Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in
graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on
graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph
formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL
and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve
Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest
model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on
semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The
model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance
on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA
(CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results
demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for
structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL
and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

*Hongli Yang,Yizhou Peng,Hao Huang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT) improves code-switching ASR in low-resource settings while preserving prior knowledge. SPT4ASR, combining SPT variants, reduces errors efficiently without degrading performance on existing languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in low-resource ASR (e.g., rare languages, code-switching) while avoiding computational costs and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Evaluate two strategies: full fine-tuning (FFT) and soft prompt tuning (SPT), introducing SPT4ASR for combining SPT variants.

Result: Deep prompt tuning is most effective; SPT4ASR achieves further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: SPT and SPT4ASR enhance CS ASR performance efficiently without compromising existing language capabilities.

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper excel in high-resource
settings but face challenges in low-resource scenarios, such as rare languages
and code-switching (CS), due to computational costs and catastrophic
forgetting. We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method
to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies:
(1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model,
demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional
methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters
and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a
combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019
datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and
our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining
parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing
languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Entire SPT and LAPT to improve multilingual ASR, showing significant performance gains in language expansion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like language interference and expanding to unseen languages in multilingual ASR without performance degradation.

Method: Proposes Entire SPT (soft prompts for encoder and decoder) and LAPT (language-aware prompts leveraging cross-lingual similarities), integrated into SPT-Whisper.

Result: Entire SPT and LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks.

Conclusion: The methods provide efficient, dynamic multilingual ASR solutions with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) have
been driven by large-scale end-to-end models like Whisper. However, challenges
such as language interference and expanding to unseen languages (language
expansion) without degrading performance persist. This paper addresses these
with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which
applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature
extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which
leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific
features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that
integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning.
Experiments across three languages from FLEURS demonstrate that Entire SPT and
LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks,
respectively, providing an efficient solution for dynamic, multilingual ASR
models with minimal computational overhead.

*Andrew MaranhÃ£o Ventura D'addario*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HealthQA-BR is a Portuguese-language benchmark for evaluating LLMs in healthcare, revealing performance gaps across specialties despite high overall scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations in healthcare are physician-centric and English-dominated, lacking interprofessional and multilingual realism.

Method: Introduced HealthQA-BR, a 5,632-question benchmark from Brazil's exams, and evaluated 20+ LLMs in a zero-shot setting.

Result: GPT 4.1 scored 86.6% overall but showed significant drops in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and Social Work (68.4%).

Conclusion: High-level scores are misleading; granular benchmarks like HealthQA-BR are essential for realistic AI safety validation in healthcare.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
dominated by physician-centric, English-language benchmarks, creating a
dangerous illusion of competence that ignores the interprofessional nature of
patient care. To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce
HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for
Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's
national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only
in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology,
social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous
zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while
state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%),
this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A
granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties
like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most
notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic
issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are
insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our
evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score
evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the
entire healthcare team.

TL;DR: The paper explores the link between general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective decision-making in AI relies on strong reasoning abilities, which are foundational for analyzing information and making sound choices.

Method: The study investigates how general reasoning training in LLMs impacts their domain-specific reasoning performance.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but the focus is on understanding the connection between general and domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of general reasoning training for enhancing LLMs' performance in specialized tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making
relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for
decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound
choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and
reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this
foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of
action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle
of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology
evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning.
This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to
their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: VIDEE is a system enabling entry-level analysts to perform advanced text analytics using LLMs, featuring a human-agent workflow with decomposition, execution, and evaluation stages. It shows usability across expertise levels and informs future designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lowering the barrier for entry-level analysts to perform text analytics without specialized NLP knowledge.

Method: VIDEE uses a three-stage workflow: Decomposition (human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search), Execution (pipeline generation), and Evaluation (LLM-based validation).

Result: Quantitative experiments and a user study confirm VIDEE's effectiveness, usability, and distinct user behavior patterns.

Conclusion: VIDEE validates human-agent collaboration for non-experts and guides future improvements in intelligent text analytics.

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for
entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text
analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.).
We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct
advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a
human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1)
Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search
algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution,
which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation,
which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user
validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to
evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study
involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience
-- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals
distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for
human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for
non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics
systems.

*Muhammad Ahmad,Muhammad Waqas,Ameer Hamza,Ildar Batyrshin,Grigori Sidorov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first annotated dataset for hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu and proposes a custom transformer model, achieving a 0.78 cross-validation score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in NLP research for low-resource, informal language varieties like Roman Urdu by focusing on hope speech detection.

Method: Developed a multi-class annotated dataset, analyzed linguistic patterns, and proposed a custom attention-based transformer model (XLM-R) evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: XLM-R outperformed baseline models (SVM and BiLSTM) with a cross-validation score of 0.78, showing significant performance gains.

Conclusion: The study advances inclusive NLP by providing tools and insights for hope speech detection in underrepresented languages like Roman Urdu.

Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable
future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes
optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although
hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and
standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms
such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a
carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP
research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four
key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset
for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope,
Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological
foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman
Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based
transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman
Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the
statistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed
model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of
0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4%
and 2.63% respectively.

*J. Koorndijk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small instruction-tuned models like LLaMA 3 8B can exhibit alignment faking, which can be mitigated by prompt-only interventions, challenging assumptions about scale and triviality of prompt-based ethics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide empirical evidence that alignment faking is not exclusive to large models and to explore interventions to reduce it.

Method: Used LLaMA 3 8B, tested prompt-only interventions (deontological moral framing, scratchpad reasoning), and introduced a taxonomy for deception types.

Result: Prompt interventions significantly reduced alignment faking, showing it's suppressible without modifying the model.

Conclusion: Alignment evaluations must consider model size and deployment settings, as deception varies in depth and suppressibility.

Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an
emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical
evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can
also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions,
including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly
reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the
assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment
requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception,
shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception,
which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the
understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for
alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

TL;DR: The paper compares direct and indirect LLM-based methods for extracting structured data from food product web pages, finding indirect methods more efficient and cost-effective despite slightly lower accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the extraction of structured information (e.g., ingredient lists, nutrition tables) from food product web pages using LLMs, addressing scalability and cost challenges.

Method: Two approaches are evaluated: direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions, tested on 3,000 food product pages from three online retailers. Metrics include accuracy, efficiency, and cost.

Result: Indirect extraction achieves 96.48% accuracy (1.61% lower than direct) but reduces LLM calls by 95.82%, improving efficiency and lowering costs.

Conclusion: Indirect extraction is scalable and cost-effective for large-scale information extraction from template-based web pages using LLMs.

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential
for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this
work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore
schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes,
such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based
approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions,
evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset
of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show
that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%,
$-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM
calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational
costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide
scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction
tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

*Hyundong Cho,Spencer Lin,Tejas Srinivasan,Michael Saxon,Deuksin Kwon,Natali T. Chavez,Jonathan May*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIME, a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models on mimed actions, highlighting their poor performance compared to humans and the need for better gesture understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of studying nonverbal communication (NVC) due to its broad scope and high variance, the paper focuses on mime as a subset with lower interpretation variance, crucial for robust vision-language models.

Method: Proposes MIME, a video-based QA benchmark with 86 mimed actions, using motion capture data and variations (character, background, viewpoint) to test recognition robustness.

Result: Open-weight and API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on MIME.

Conclusion: The results underscore the need for further research to improve models' understanding of human gestures.

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but
studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high
variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the
theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and
movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions
with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid
understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language
models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC.
Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel
video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions.
Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each
action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint
for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and
API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on
MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust

### [31] [Is DeepSeek a New Voice Among LLMs in Public Opinion Simulation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21587)
*Weihong Qi,Fan Huang,Jisun An,Haewoon Kwak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other LLMs in simulating U.S. opinions on abortion and Chinese opinions on foreign aid, but shows biases and limitations in other areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the performance of open-source and proprietary LLMs in simulating public opinions across cultures and demographics.

Method: Comparison of DeepSeek models with Qwen2.5, GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 using ANES and Zuobiao datasets for U.S. and Chinese public opinion topics.

Result: DeepSeek-V3 excels in specific topics but struggles with biases and overgeneralization within demographic groups.

Conclusion: LLMs need improved training to reduce cultural and demographic biases in public opinion modeling.

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language
model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by
major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5,
GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National
Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these
models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and
the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between
countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate
change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily
because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or
liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling
views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income
and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant
differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the
free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to
overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting
to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to
mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling,
calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

### [32] [Understanding Verbatim Memorization in LLMs Through Circuit Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21588)
*Ilya Lasy,Peter Knees,Stefan Woltran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the mechanisms of memorization in LLMs, identifying specific circuits responsible for initiating and maintaining memorization, and explores their context-dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs memorize training data, focusing on the exact network parts and behavioral differences between memorized and non-memorized outputs.

Method: Uses transformer circuits and contrastive datasets to isolate and analyze circuits involved in memorization initiation and maintenance.

Result: Found that initiation circuits can maintain memorization, but maintenance circuits cannot initiate it. Memorization prevention is domain-robust, while induction is context-dependent.

Conclusion: Memorization in LLMs involves distinct circuits with varying roles and dependencies, offering insights for mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of
training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network
decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization
sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing
memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions
from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits
-- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within
the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify
points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the
specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find
that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started,
while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation.
Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across
different text domains, while memorization induction appears more
context-dependent.

### [33] [A General Method for Detecting Information Generated by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21589)
*Minjia Mao,Dongjun Wei,Xiao Fang,Michael Chau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a general LLM detector (GLD) to identify LLM-generated content across unseen models and domains, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLMs makes it hard to distinguish human-written from AI-generated content, threatening trust and enabling misinformation. Current detectors fail with new LLMs and domains.

Method: GLD uses twin memory networks and a theory-guided detection generalization module for cross-model and cross-domain detection.

Result: Empirical evaluations show GLD surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting LLM-generated content.

Conclusion: GLD offers a robust solution for detecting LLM-generated content, with significant implications for digital platforms and LLM research.

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly
challenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content.
Detecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on
digital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the
spread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS
research. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on
identifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face
challenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This
limitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the
number of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of
domains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a
twin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module
to detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using
real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case
studies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection
methods. The study has important academic and practical implications for
digital platforms and LLMs.

### [34] [Representation Consistency for Accurate and Coherent LLM Answer Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21590)
*Junqi Jiang,Tom Bewley,Salim I. Amoukou,Francesco Leofante,Antonio Rago,Saumitra Mishra,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Representation Consistency (RC) improves LLM performance by aggregating answers from multiple responses, considering both answer frequency and internal activation consistency, without extra model queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods for LLMs require complex modifications. RC aims to simplify and enhance answer aggregation by leveraging internal model activations.

Method: RC aggregates answers by analyzing the consistency of internal activations (dense or sparse) during response generation, down-weighting answers with high variability.

Result: Experiments show RC improves accuracy by up to 4% over baselines, with sparse activations aligning well with coherent reasoning.

Conclusion: RC is an effective, lightweight method for enhancing LLM performance during inference by leveraging representation consistency.

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by
allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing
methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling
strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a
test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate
responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations
in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not
only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate
response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations
while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations
can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained
sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of
multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this
answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be
down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached
activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional
model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four
reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task
performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)
over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the
sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent
reasoning.

### [35] [FinEval-KR: A Financial Domain Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models' Knowledge and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21591)
*Shaoyu Dou,Yutian Shen,Mofan Chen,Zixuan Wang,Jiajie Xu,Qi Guo,Kailai Shao,Chao Chen,Haixiang Hu,Haibo Shi,Min Min,Liwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinEval-KR is a framework to evaluate LLMs' financial reasoning by decoupling knowledge and reasoning abilities, introducing distinct scores and a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy. It includes a new Chinese financial dataset and finds reasoning and cognitive abilities are key to accuracy, with knowledge application being a bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to decouple knowledge and reasoning in financial tasks or analyze root causes of failures, limiting understanding of LLMs' capabilities.

Method: Introduces FinEval-KR, a framework with knowledge and reasoning scores, and a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy. Releases a Chinese financial reasoning dataset for evaluation.

Result: LLM reasoning and higher-order cognitive abilities are crucial for accuracy, but knowledge application remains a bottleneck. Specialized financial LLMs underperform top general models.

Conclusion: FinEval-KR provides a nuanced evaluation of LLMs in financial reasoning, highlighting the importance of reasoning and cognitive skills while identifying gaps in knowledge application.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face
challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge
and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by
not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and
lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce
FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs'
knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge
score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further
propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in
reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new
open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to
support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning.
Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order
cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also
specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge
application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs
generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

*Tinh Nguyen,Minh Khue Phan Tran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel BART-based encoder-decoder model for sign language recognition achieves high accuracy (96.04%) with fewer parameters, outperforming traditional methods by independently processing x and y coordinates while maintaining their interrelation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy in sign language recognition, and overcoming limitations of traditional models like RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs.

Method: Uses a BART encoder-decoder architecture to independently encode x and y coordinates of skeleton sequences, with Cross-Attention to maintain their interrelation.

Result: Achieves 96.04% accuracy on LSA-64 dataset, outperforming larger models, and demonstrates strong generalization on WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets.

Conclusion: The model provides a reliable, efficient solution for sign language recognition, enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of hearing.

Abstract: Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments
to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to
choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had
problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite
improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This
study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of
independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of
skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By
utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently
encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their
interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves
96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous
models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent
performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation
studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and
using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study
offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with
strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that mid-sized models can outperform larger ones in specialized domains like medicine with strategic training and transparent reasoning.

Method: Two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning on synthetic medical data with parameter-efficient techniques (DoRA, rsLoRA), followed by reinforcement learning (GRPO) with a multi-component reward system.

Result: Achieves 87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing larger models.

Conclusion: Provides a reproducible framework for domain-specific models balancing performance, efficiency, and explainability, addressing challenges like reward hacking and training instability.

Abstract: We present Gazal-R1, a 32-billion-parameter language model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance in medical reasoning while providing transparent,
step-by-step explanations for clinical decision-making. Built upon Qwen3 32B,
our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to
outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We
developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on
a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples
that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced
parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation
(DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component
reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality.
Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring
87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing
models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work
provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable
models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training
instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed
reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing
high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance,
efficiency, and explainability.

*Jinpyo Kim,Gyeongje Cho,Chanwoo Park,Jongwon Park,Jongmin Kim,Yeonkyoun So,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-effective method to adapt English-based LLMs to Korean, detailing the end-to-end process and achieving superior performance with minimal resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving LLM capabilities in non-English languages like Korean is crucial, as current models underperform. The lack of transparency in LLM training processes also motivates this work.

Method: The approach involves collecting Korean datasets, preprocessing, training, creating benchmarks, and evaluating. The process is designed for low-budget scenarios.

Result: The bilingual models Thunder-LLM and Thunder-LLM-Ins outperform state-of-the-art models in Korean with minimal data and computational resources.

Conclusion: The method effectively and efficiently adds new language capabilities to LLMs, with shared code and comprehensive insights for public use.

Abstract: Since state-of-the-art LLMs often underperform in languages other than
English or Chinese, improving the capability of LLMs in new languages has
become an essential task. Moreover, LLMs' entire end-to-end training process
remains largely unknown to the public due to proprietary reasons, technical
complexity, inconsistent documentation, and ethical considerations. The
complete picture remains a closely guarded secret within the industry. This
paper presents methods to adapt an existing English-based LLM to Korean in a
low-budget scenario. We describe the entire end-to-end process: collecting
Korean datasets, preprocessing the data, training the model, creating
downstream benchmarks, and conducting evaluations. The evaluation results
indicate that our method can effectively and cost-efficiently add new language
capabilities to existing LLMs. Our new bilingual models, Thunder-LLM and
Thunder-LLM-Ins, achieve superior Korean performance compared to
state-of-the-art models while utilizing minimal data and computational
resources. We share our comprehensive experience and make the code publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates MLLMs on textbook QA using CK12-QA, introduces a multimodal RAG pipeline, and highlights limitations and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test MLLMs' reasoning on complex educational content like lessons and diagrams, which are not single images.

Method: Evaluates LLaVA and LLaMA 3.2-Vision on TQA, introduces a lightweight multimodal RAG pipeline integrating lesson paragraphs and diagrams.

Result: Shows the impact of retrieved context on accuracy and reasoning, but reveals limitations in handling question-context relationships and noise.

Conclusion: Identifies key areas for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning, emphasizing the need for improved context handling.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over
complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be
represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work,
we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook
question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the
performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA
3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that
integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our
results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model
accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling
question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key
directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

Motivation: To evaluate and stress-test large language models (LLMs) on medically-oriented question answering at a General Practitioner level.

Method: Uses 4,978 expert-verified medical QA pairs in 7 formats. Systems are deployed via Docker/Apptainer on CodaBench or Zaratan cluster. Automated scoring (Task 1) and physician panel audits (Task 2) evaluate performance.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but the setup allows for benchmarking LLM performance on medical QA.

Conclusion: ClinIQLink provides a robust framework for evaluating LLMs in medical QA, combining automated and expert human assessment.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an overview of ClinIQLink, a shared task,
collocated with the 24th BioNLP workshop at ACL 2025, designed to stress-test
large language models (LLMs) on medically-oriented question answering aimed at
the level of a General Practitioner. The challenge supplies 4,978

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Input format affects document comprehension in MLLMs; structured text (LaTex-like encoding) improves performance by preserving hierarchy and spatial relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked impact of input format on MLLMs' document understanding, countering the assumption that raw OCR text aids performance.

Method: Proposed a structure-preserving approach using LaTex-like encoding to maintain document hierarchy and spatial relationships. Analyzed attention patterns.

Result: Structured text improves MLLMs' question answering performance by reducing attention dispersion and focusing on meaningful regions.

Conclusion: Structured input formats enhance document comprehension without model changes, highlighting the importance of preserving document structure.

Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on
locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work
investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences
document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover
that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which
is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and
structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel
structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex
paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships
critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text
induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content,
directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing
attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question
answering performance across diverse document types without requiring
architectural modifications or additional training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiMark is a novel watermarking framework for LLM-generated text, addressing text quality, model-agnostic detection, and message embedding capacity. It outperforms existing methods in extraction rates and quality preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulatory demands for reliable identification of LLM-generated text necessitate watermarking solutions that balance quality, detection, and message capacity.

Method: BiMark introduces a bit-flip unbiased reweighting mechanism, multilayer architecture, and information encoding for multi-bit watermarking.

Result: BiMark achieves 30% higher extraction rates for short texts, maintains text quality (lower perplexity), and performs comparably to non-watermarked text in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: BiMark successfully balances trade-offs in watermarking, offering a practical solution for LLM-generated text authentication.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns
about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for
reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising
solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical
requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message
embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve
these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text
quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge,
we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these
requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting
mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture
enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an
information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to
state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30%
higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality
indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text
on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

Motivation: To humanize AES systems by evaluating beyond accuracy, focusing on bias, robustness, and explainability.

Method: Comparison of ML-based and LLM approaches across key dimensions like bias, robustness, and explainability.

Result: ML models are more accurate but less explainable; LLMs offer better explanations but both struggle with bias and robustness.

Conclusion: Identifies challenges and trade-offs, aiming to improve AES reliability and trustworthiness.

Abstract: This paper explores the human-centric operationalization of Automated Essay

machine learning-based approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) approaches,
identifying their strengths, similarities and differences. The study
investigates key dimensions such as bias, robustness, and explainability,
considered important for human-aware operationalization of AES systems. Our
study shows that ML-based AES models outperform LLMs in accuracy but struggle
with explainability, whereas LLMs provide richer explanations. We also found
that both approaches struggle with bias and robustness to edge scores. By
analyzing these dimensions, the paper aims to identify challenges and
trade-offs between different methods, contributing to more reliable and

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemBench, a benchmark for evaluating memory capabilities of LLM-based agents, addressing gaps in diversity and metrics of existing evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of memory mechanisms in LLM-based agents lack diversity in memory levels and interactive scenarios, and comprehensive metrics.

Method: The authors construct a dataset with factual and reflective memory levels, and participation/observation scenarios, then develop the MemBench benchmark.

Result: MemBench evaluates memory capabilities (effectiveness, efficiency, capacity) and is publicly released.

Conclusion: The work provides a comprehensive tool for assessing LLM-based agents' memory, benefiting the research community.

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted the significance of memory mechanisms in
LLM-based agents, which enable them to store observed information and adapt to
dynamic environments. However, evaluating their memory capabilities still
remains challenges. Previous evaluations are commonly limited by the diversity
of memory levels and interactive scenarios. They also lack comprehensive
metrics to reflect the memory capabilities from multiple aspects. To address
these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and
benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset
incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and
proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based
on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory
capability of LLM-based agents from multiple aspects, including their
effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity. To benefit the research community, we
release our dataset and project at https://github.com/import-myself/Membench.

### [45] [Large Language Models as symbolic DNA of cultural dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21606)
*Parham Pourdavood,Michael Jacob,Terrence Deacon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper redefines LLMs as cultural 'DNA,' preserving human symbolic patterns without understanding, enabling human creativity through reinterpretation and recursion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift the perception of LLMs from autonomous intelligence or mimicry to cultural repositories that enhance human creativity and self-reflection.

Method: Analyzes four featuresâcompression, decompression, externalization, and recursionâto compare LLMs to DNA in preserving cultural dynamics.

Result: LLMs serve as tools for cultural evolvability, fostering human creativity and hypothesis-generation without replacing human intelligence.

Conclusion: LLMs' value lies in aiding human self-reflection and cultural exploration, not in competing with human cognition.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs)
as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for
human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous
intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as
repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic
expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues
without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns
only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive
feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately
catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal
features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we
demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium
for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference
to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human
culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.
Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human
intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful
hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework
positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to
generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human
interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics
and norms.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi,Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE-KG is a modular framework for building interpretable knowledge graphs from legal texts, reducing noise and duplication compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human smuggling networks are complex and hard to analyze, with legal case documents being unstructured and dense, posing challenges for automated KG construction.

Method: CORE-KG uses a two-step pipeline: type-aware coreference resolution via structured LLM prompts and domain-guided entity/relationship extraction.

Result: CORE-KG reduces node duplication by 33.28% and legal noise by 38.37%, producing cleaner graphs.

Conclusion: CORE-KG provides a robust foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically
dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for
automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on
static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based
approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations,
and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG,
a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a
two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential,
structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using
domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG
reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a

*Junhao Liu,Zhenhao Xu,Yuxin Fang,Yichuan Chen,Zuobin Ying,Wenhan Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to analyze reasoning processes of four advanced LLMs, revealing patterns in their problem-solving and output coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks systematic comparison of LLMs' reasoning processes, especially self-reflection and cross-domain connections.

Method: Uses keyword statistics and LLM-as-a-judge to analyze reasoning in four models (GPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, Grok-3) on a diverse dataset.

Result: Identifies disparities in reasoning depth, intermediate step reliance, and similarity to GPT-o1, highlighting trade-offs between efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: Provides insights for improving model design and evaluation, with publicly released project.

Abstract: Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models
(LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However,
existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of
these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their
self-reflection pattern (also termed "Aha moment") and the interconnections
across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the
reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,
DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge
paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their
final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based
questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step
problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both
the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research
results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and
exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning
process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among
these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the
reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their
thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers
valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and
reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model
design and evaluation in practical applications. We publicly release our

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effectiveness of integrating textual information into time series forecasting models, finding that gains are not universal and depend on model and data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether and under what conditions multimodal integration (text + time series) improves forecasting performance.

Method: Systematic evaluation of two multimodal paradigms (aligning-based and prompting-based methods) across 14 forecasting tasks in 7 domains.

Result: Multimodal gains are inconsistent; effectiveness depends on model capacity, alignment strategies, data availability, and text's complementary predictive signal.

Conclusion: Practical guidelines are provided for when multimodality aids forecasting, emphasizing model and data conditions.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual
information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it
remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration
consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across
a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including
health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal
forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text
representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large
language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from
multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and
models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest
unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we
disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data
characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,
incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text
models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate
aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when
(4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary
predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.
Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be
expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

### [50] [AdaptGOT: A Pre-trained Model for Adaptive Contextual POI Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21612)
*Xiaobin Ren,Xinyu Zhu,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaptGOT, a model for POI embedding that combines adaptive representation learning with geographical, co-occurrence, and textual data to address challenges like multi-context sampling and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current POI embedding methods face challenges in multi-context sampling, versatility, and generalization, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: AdaptGOT integrates adaptive representation learning and GOT (Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text) representation, using contextual neighborhood generation, attention-enhanced GOT representation, and a MoE-based adaptive encoder-decoder.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show AdaptGOT outperforms existing methods in POI tasks.

Conclusion: AdaptGOT effectively addresses POI embedding challenges, offering superior performance and versatility.

Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI)
embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like
recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific,
end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include
the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient
exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate
generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which
integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the
Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis
on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT
model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation,
which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based,
importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual
neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention
mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and
efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based
adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency
and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence
across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple
POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

bridge this gap, we introduce ChildGuard1, a curated dataset derived from
existing corpora and enriched with child-specific annotations. ChildGuard
captures diverse contexts of child-targeted hate speech, spanning age groups.
We benchmark existing state-of-the-art hate speech detection methods, including
Large Language Models (LLMs), and assess their effectiveness in detecting and
contextualizing child-targeted hate speech. To foster further research in this
area, we publicly release ChildGuard, providing a robust foundation for
developing improved methods to detect and mitigate such harm.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LastingBench is a framework to mitigate data leakage in QA benchmarks by identifying and rewriting leakage points, ensuring fairer LLM evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about LLMs cheating on QA benchmarks due to memorization, undermining benchmark validity.

Method: Uses perturbation to identify leakage points, then rewrites them to counterfactual ones to disrupt memorization.

Result: Significant performance gaps in QA benchmarks, proving LastingBench's efficacy in reducing memorization effects.

Conclusion: LastingBench provides a scalable solution for robust benchmarks, promoting fair and interpretable LLM evaluations.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns
about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks
by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark
evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead
the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such
leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and
preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce
LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and
safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench
identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites
the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while
preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting
the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench
offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over
time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GARMLE-G is a framework that enhances medical language models by grounding outputs in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models rely on ICD codes, which lack clinical nuance. GARMLE-G aims to align model outputs with clinician reasoning by integrating CPGs.

Method: GARMLE-G combines LLM predictions with EHR data for queries, retrieves CPG snippets via embeddings, and fuses guidelines with model outputs.

Result: The prototype outperformed baselines in precision, relevance, and guideline adherence, proving suitable for localized healthcare.

Conclusion: GARMLE-G offers a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free solution for evidence-based clinical model deployment.

Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs),
typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records
(EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not
capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis.
Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits
the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a
Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model
outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by
directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on
model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create
semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via
embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to
generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for
hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,
demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical
guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a
lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This
work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding
medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong
potential for broader clinical deployment.

*Chuanrui Hu,Wei Hu,Penghang Yu,Hua Zhang,Bing-Kun Bao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Timeline Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS), addressing limitations of general LLMs in topic relevance and evolution understanding. It introduces a large-scale dataset and a progressive optimization strategy for improved summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using general LLMs for TLS struggle with topic relevance and evolution understanding, leading to irrelevant or inaccurate summaries.

Method: The paper presents a large-scale TLS dataset and a progressive optimization strategy involving instruction tuning and dual-alignment reward learning for semantic and temporal alignment.

Result: TIM demonstrates robust TLS capabilities, validated through extensive open-domain experiments.

Conclusion: TIM effectively addresses TLS challenges, outperforming general LLMs in summarization and topic evolution understanding.

Abstract: Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the
evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods
typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant
timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in
zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with
assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the
summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate
timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline
Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively
summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a
large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000
annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization
strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs
instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information
filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment
reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal
perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution
principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a
robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in
open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IndexTTS2 introduces a novel method for precise duration control in autoregressive TTS models, supports two generation modes, disentangles emotion and speaker identity, and improves emotional clarity using GPT latent representations and soft instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive TTS models struggle with precise duration control and emotional disentanglement, limiting applications like video dubbing.

Method: IndexTTS2 proposes a duration control method, disentangles emotion and speaker identity, uses GPT latent representations for stability, and employs soft instructions for emotion control.

Result: IndexTTS2 outperforms state-of-the-art TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity, and emotional fidelity.

Conclusion: IndexTTS2 advances TTS by enabling precise duration control, emotional disentanglement, and improved emotional clarity.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into
autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems
exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token
generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of
synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video
dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces
IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for
speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows
explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration
control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely
generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input
prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional
expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and
emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the
emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a
separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to
reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance
clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent
representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier
for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual
descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech
generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.
Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing
state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,
and emotional fidelity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates GPT-4's ability to replicate partisan Reddit comments from the 2016 US election, finding it generates realistic but consensus-leaning content, with implications for AI-driven discourse manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess LLMs' potential to influence political debates by mimicking partisan user content in divisive scenarios.

Method: Three experiments where GPT-4 impersonates real/artificial partisan users; analysis of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic features compared to real comments.

Result: GPT-4 produces realistic comments favoring or opposing candidates but leans toward consensus; real and artificial comments differ semantically but not manually.

Conclusion: LLMs can subtly influence political discussions, raising concerns about AI-driven discourse manipulation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation
to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both
opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant
online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in
replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario:
Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular,
we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by
impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the
generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic
features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking
against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments,
both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet
tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that
real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded
space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings
provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions,
influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader
implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

Motivation: The lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset for human-evaluated proofs hinders progress in LLM-based mathematical proof generation.

Method: Creation of the OPC dataset with proofs from top LLMs, including solutions to prestigious math competitions, and its use to explore key questions in proof generation.

Result: The OPC enables analysis of proof generation gaps and finetunes an 8B-parameter model matching Gemini-2.5-Pro in proof correctness evaluation.

Conclusion: The OPC is a valuable resource for advancing proof generation research and improving LLM capabilities in mathematics.

Abstract: In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the
lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While
expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in
training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In
this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over
5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was
specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof
generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of
correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics
competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical
questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between
natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between
final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n
selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we
finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs
on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof
correctness.

Result: Doc2SAR achieves 80.78% Table Recall on DocSAR-200, surpassing GPT-4o by 51.48%.

Conclusion: Doc2SAR offers a robust, efficient solution for SAR extraction, validated by its performance and practical web app.

Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific
literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research.
However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats
and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches
relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts,
while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient
accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and
optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we
introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific
documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods.
Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates
domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading
end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of

### [62] [Do We Really Need GNNs with Explicit Structural Modeling? MLPs Suffice for Language Model Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21682)
*Li Zhou,Hao Jiang,Junjie Li,Zefeng Zhao,Feng Jiang,Wenyu Chen,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probing framework to evaluate how explicit structural modeling enhances language models, comparing GNNs and MLPs. MLPs outperform GNNs in encoding structural information, especially when focusing on feature-transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent findings show GNNs underutilize structural information, while MLPs, despite lacking message-passing, perform well in structure-aware tasks. This motivates a systematic evaluation of structural modeling's role and MLPs' potential as alternatives.

Method: A probing framework with a control module isolates GNN components (message-passing and feature-transformation) to assess their individual contributions. The Edge Probing Suite evaluates linguistic knowledge in LMs.

Result: MLPs, as feature-transformation modules, consistently improve linguistic knowledge encoding in LMs. GNNs with feature-transformation also benefit, while models relying solely on message-passing underperform.

Conclusion: Feature-transformation operations, not message-passing, are key to encoding structural information. MLPs are efficient alternatives to GNNs for enhancing LM representations.

Abstract: Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities
and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies
indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms
inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.
Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing
framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed
to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing
language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as
efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing
classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of
either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the
message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach
isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,
avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge
Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge
encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,
consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations
across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and
semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation
operations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on
message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative
impacts on probing task performance.

*Swastika Kundu,Autoshi Ibrahim,Mithila Rahman,Tanvir Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ANUBHUTI is a dataset of 2000 Bangla dialect sentences (Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, Chittagong) with dual annotations (thematic and emotional) for sentiment analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment analysis for Bangla dialects is underexplored due to linguistic diversity and lack of annotated data.

Method: Dataset creation with manual translation, dual annotation (thematic and emotional), and quality assurance via Cohens Kappa.

Result: Strong inter-annotator consistency and a refined dataset for low-resource Bangla dialects.

Conclusion: ANUBHUTI addresses the gap in sentiment analysis resources for Bangla dialects, enhancing NLP accuracy.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored
area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper
introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences
manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects
Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly
features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio
political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance.
Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic
labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and
multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger,
Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native
translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance
performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong
consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic
checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a
critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla
dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

*Tzu-Quan Lin,Hsi-Chun Cheng,Hung-yi Lee,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how self-supervised speech Transformers encode speaker information by identifying key neurons in feed-forward layers, revealing their role in speaker-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how self-supervised speech Transformers encode speaker information, a gap in current research.

Method: Analyze neurons correlated with k-means clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors, focusing on phonetic and gender classes.

Result: Identified neurons correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, crucial for speaker information. Protecting them during pruning preserves speaker-related task performance.

Conclusion: Key neurons in feed-forward layers encode speaker information, and their protection enhances model performance in speaker-related tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the impact of self-supervised speech Transformers has
extended to speaker-related applications. However, little research has explored
how these models encode speaker information. In this work, we address this gap
by identifying neurons in the feed-forward layers that are correlated with
speaker information. Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means
clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that
these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them
suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these
neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on
speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker
information.

*Eivind Morris Bakke,Nora Winger Heggelund*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how parametric knowledge biases in LLMs like Llama 3.1 affect fact-checking in the HerO system, revealing biases in verdicts and evidence retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how biases in LLMs influence fact-checking outcomes, focusing on parametric knowledge and injected bias.

Method: Examined Llama 3.1's fact-verification performance and its response to biased prompts, analyzing verdicts and retrieved evidence.

Result: Llama 3.1 often labels claims as "Not Enough Evidence" and shows bias in evidence retrieval, though verdicts remain stable.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit biases in fact-checking, but final predictions are resilient to prompting strategies.

Abstract: Automatic fact verification systems increasingly rely on large language
models (LLMs). We investigate how parametric knowledge biases in these models
affect fact-checking outcomes of the HerO system (baseline for FEVER-25). We
examine how the system is affected by: (1) potential bias in Llama 3.1's
parametric knowledge and (2) intentionally injected bias. When prompted
directly to perform fact-verification, Llama 3.1 labels nearly half the claims
as "Not Enough Evidence". Using only its parametric knowledge it is able to
reach a verdict on the remaining half of the claims. In the second experiment,
we prompt the model to generate supporting, refuting, or neutral fact-checking
documents. These prompts significantly influence retrieval outcomes, with
approximately 50\% of retrieved evidence being unique to each perspective.
Notably, the model sometimes refuses to generate supporting documents for
claims it believes to be false, creating an inherent negative bias. Despite
differences in retrieved evidence, final verdict predictions show stability
across prompting strategies. The code is available at:

### [66] [Evaluating List Construction and Temporal Understanding capabilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21783)
*Alexandru Dumitru,V Venktesh,Adam Jatowt,Avishek Anand*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TLQA, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on temporal understanding and list-based question answering, highlighting current model shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with temporal tasks involving multiple entities, lacking benchmarks for such evaluations.

Method: Proposed TLQA benchmark for structured list answers with time references, tested in closed-book and open-domain settings.

Result: Current models fail in complete answer generation and temporal alignment, especially in closed-book setups.

Conclusion: TLQA identifies gaps in LLMs' temporal and list-construction abilities, guiding future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide
range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to
hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks
involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate
entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in
answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds.
Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to
perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer
construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List
based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in
list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark,
requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously,
which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks.
We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of
state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain
settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models,
particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align
facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain
setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA. The benchmark

### [67] [Offensive Language Detection on Social Media Using XLNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21795)
*Reem Alothman,Hafida Benhidour,Said Kerrache*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an XLNet-based model for detecting offensive language on social media, comparing it with BERT. XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and categorizing offenses, while BERT is better at identifying targets. Oversampling and undersampling improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of offensive content on social media necessitates automated detection systems due to impractical manual moderation.

Method: The study uses XLNet and BERT, evaluated on the OLID dataset, with oversampling and undersampling to address class imbalance.

Result: XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and categorizing offenses, while BERT excels in identifying targets. Sampling strategies improve performance.

Conclusion: Transfer learning, especially XLNet, is effective for robust offensive language detection on social media.

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats,
comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an
increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms
of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual
moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can
detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using
transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding
natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an
automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized
autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely
used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated
using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter
dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show
that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing
the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the
targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and
undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and
improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of
transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for
detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

Result: A suite of programmatic tools for rendering allotaxonographs, catering to different use cases across programming languages.

Conclusion: Allotaxonographs provide a versatile and theoretically sound approach for comparing complex systems, with practical implementations for diverse applications.

Abstract: Describing and comparing complex systems requires principled, theoretically
grounded tools. Built around the phenomenon of type turbulence,
allotaxonographs provide map-and-list visual comparisons of pairs of
heavy-tailed distributions. Allotaxonographs are designed to accommodate a wide
range of instruments including rank- and probability-turbulence divergences,
Jenson-Shannon divergence, and generalized entropy divergences. Here, we
describe a suite of programmatic tools for rendering allotaxonographs for
rank-turbulence divergence in Matlab, Javascript, and Python, all of which have
different use cases.

### [69] [Towards Transparent AI: A Survey on Explainable Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21812)
*Avash Palikhe,Zhenyu Yu,Zichong Wang,Wenbin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey reviews explainability techniques for LLMs, categorizing XAI methods by transformer architectures and evaluating their practical applications, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack transparency in decision-making, hindering their adoption in high-stakes domains. This survey aims to systematically understand and categorize XAI methods to improve LLM explainability.

Method: The survey categorizes XAI methods based on transformer architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder) and evaluates their explainability and practical use.

Result: The review highlights current XAI techniques, their evaluations, and applications, identifying gaps and challenges in LLM explainability.

Conclusion: The survey guides future research toward transparent and responsible LLMs by addressing challenges and suggesting directions for XAI development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing
Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often
struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box'
and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of
transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in
high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly
essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide
human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding
of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a
comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods
based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in
terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further
explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.
Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and
future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing
transparent and responsible LLMs.

### [70] [Exploring the Structure of AI-Induced Language Change in Scientific English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21817)
*Riley Galpin,Bryce Anderson,Tom S. Juzek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT influence scientific English, revealing semantic and pragmatic shifts rather than simple synonym replacement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structural impact of LLMs on language, focusing on frequency spikes of words like 'delve' and 'crucial' and their broader linguistic effects.

Method: Analyzed synonym groups and part-of-speech tagging in PubMed abstracts to quantify shifts in word usage and grammatical categories.

Result: Semantic clusters shift together, indicating LLMs induce broader semantic changes. Words like 'important' decline, showing complex patterns of language change.

Conclusion: LLMs primarily drive semantic and pragmatic shifts in language, contrasting with abrupt lexical changes, offering insights into technology's role in language evolution.

Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent
years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing
significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely
attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in
the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in
frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.
The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve
the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial"
replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and
pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include
part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over
grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential"
as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for
widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific
abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift
together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern
suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic
and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important"
shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze
decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more
complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts
with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of
language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology
continues to shape human language.

*Kourosh Shahnazari,Mohammadali Keshtparvar,Seyed Moein Ayyoubzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-input neural framework combining transformer-based language encoding with semantic, stylometric, and metrical features achieves 71% accuracy in Persian poetry authorship attribution, with 97% accuracy at high confidence thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of Persian classical poetry's linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects makes computational authorship attribution challenging. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: A multi-input neural framework with transformer-based language encoding, Word2Vec embeddings, stylometric measures, and metrical encodings is applied to a corpus of 647,653 verses. Verse-level classification and voting schemes are used.

Result: Weighted voting achieves 71% accuracy, while threshold-based filtering at 0.9 confidence yields 97% accuracy (lower coverage).

Conclusion: The framework integrates deep learning with domain-specific features, aiding authorship disputes and computational literature research, with potential for multilingual and generative applications.

Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian
classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In
this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67
prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a
transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the
semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature
set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric
measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a
vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the
data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving
poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level
classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,
revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate
threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly
confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at
lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational
forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The
results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification
and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general
computational literature research. This research will facilitate further
research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative
modeling of Persian poetry.

TL;DR: LinguaSynth is a transparent, efficient NLP framework combining five linguistic features in logistic regression, outperforming TF-IDF and challenging deep learning's necessity for high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing interpretability and computational efficiency concerns in deep learning-based NLP by proposing a transparent alternative.

Method: Integrates lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level, and document-level semantic features in a logistic regression model.

Result: Achieves 84.89% accuracy on 20 Newsgroups, surpassing TF-IDF by 3.32%, with syntactic and entity-level features proving critical.

Conclusion: LinguaSynth demonstrates that interpretable, efficient models can rival deep learning in text classification, questioning the need for black-box approaches.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced NLP, but its reliance on large
black-box models introduces critical interpretability and computational
efficiency concerns. This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text
classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary
linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level
semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic
regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains
interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89
percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by
3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that
syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and
effectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new
benchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the
prevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for
high-performing text classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the consistency hypothesis in black-box uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for LLMs, introduces statistical tests to evaluate it, and proposes data-free UQ methods that outperform baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating LLM output confidence is crucial for user trust, but existing UQ methods rely on implicit assumptions like generation consistency.

Method: The authors formalize the consistency hypothesis, introduce three mathematical statements with statistical tests, and propose data-free UQ methods using generation similarities.

Result: Empirical tests on 8 datasets and 3 tasks validate the consistency hypothesis, with the 'Sim-Any' hypothesis being most actionable. Proposed UQ methods outperform baselines.

Conclusion: The consistency hypothesis is prevalent and actionable, enabling effective black-box UQ methods for LLM confidence estimation.

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential
for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty
quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained
popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the
implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency
as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis.
We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests
to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output
conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark
datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL),
highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the
statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and
demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods
that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.
These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical
value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Derivational Probing to study how syntactic structures form across neural language model layers, revealing a bottom-up derivation in BERT where micro-syntactic structures in lower layers integrate into macro-syntactic structures in higher layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how syntactic structures are constructed across layers in neural language models, as current understanding is limited.

Method: Proposed Derivational Probing to analyze micro- and macro-syntactic structures in BERT's layers.

Result: Micro-syntactic structures emerge in lower layers and integrate into macro-syntactic structures in higher layers, with timing of integration affecting downstream performance.

Conclusion: Optimal timing for integrating global syntactic information is critical for model performance, as shown by subject-verb agreement evaluation.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that neural language models encode syntactic
structures in their internal representations, yet the derivations by which
these structures are constructed across layers remain poorly understood. In
this paper, we propose Derivational Probing to investigate how micro-syntactic
structures (e.g., subject noun phrases) and macro-syntactic structures (e.g.,
the relationship between the root verbs and their direct dependents) are
constructed as word embeddings propagate upward across layers. Our experiments
on BERT reveal a clear bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures emerge
in lower layers and are gradually integrated into a coherent macro-syntactic
structure in higher layers. Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb
number agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic
structures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing
for integrating global syntactic information.

*Hang Shao,Heting Gao,Yunhang Shen,Jiawei Chen,Lijiang Li,Zuwei Long,Bo Tong,Ke Li,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepTalk, a native MLLM framework using MoE, reduces performance drop to 5.5% and maintains low latency, addressing data insufficiency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Native MLLMs struggle with catastrophic forgetting due to insufficient paired speech-text data compared to text-only LLMs.

Method: DeepTalk uses a MoE architecture for adaptive modality expert learning, with specialized single-modality training followed by joint multimodal training.

Result: Achieves only a 5.5% performance drop (vs. 20% in other native MLLMs) and keeps latency under 0.5 seconds.

Conclusion: DeepTalk effectively balances performance and latency, offering seamless speech interaction.

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large
language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech
and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs
preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and
generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a
separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response
latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available
paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs
compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To
address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality
expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk
first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality
load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized
single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.
As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the
original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of
over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par
with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within
0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a specialized benchmark for evaluating speech-based LLMs, addressing gaps in existing methods by incorporating speech-specific challenges and a query-aware evaluation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs are text-based and overlook speech-specific challenges like prosody and homophones, hindering optimal performance in real-world speech applications.

Method: The authors curate real-world chat data, diversify speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. They also design a query-aware evaluation method using customized checklists and prompts.

Result: Testing reveals significant performance differences among speech models across scenarios. The query-aware method enables finer-grained assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark offers valuable insights for developing and evaluating speech models, addressing unique speech challenges.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have
demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the
lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM
evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world
applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks,
overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody,
homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a
novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations.
We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios,
introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment
the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware
evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to
enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing
and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing
significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios.
The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment
under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable
insights for speech model development and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as internal world models (WMs) using a two-stage framework (Perception and Prediction) and a benchmark (WM-ABench). Results show significant limitations in VLMs' basic WM abilities compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess VLMs' fundamental world modeling abilities, which remain underexplored despite their potential as general-purpose WMs.

Method: A two-stage framework evaluates Perception (visual, spatial, temporal, quantitative, motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation, transitive inference, compositional inference). WM-ABench, a large-scale benchmark, is used for testing 15 VLMs across 23 dimensions in 6 environments.

Result: VLMs exhibit striking limitations in basic WM abilities, performing near-random in tasks like motion trajectory distinction and showing biases (e.g., associating color with speed).

Conclusion: Significant gaps exist between VLMs and human-level world modeling, highlighting the need for improvement in fundamental WM abilities.

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and
predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning.
Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and
Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have
evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual
understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities
remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we
propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial,
temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation,
transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation
of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse
simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660
experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these
models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For
instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing
motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding --
e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones.
More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and
human-level world modeling.

### [78] [A Dual-Layered Evaluation of Geopolitical and Cultural Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21881)
*Sean Kim,Hyuhng Joon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates bias in large language models (LLMs) through a two-phase study, distinguishing between model bias (from training) and inference bias (from query language). Phase 1 tests factual questions for consistency across languages, while Phase 2 examines geopolitically sensitive disputes. Results show query language affects alignment in Phase 1 and interplay between training and query language in Phase 2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLM behavior in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, especially where outputs influence public opinion or dominant narratives.

Method: A two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assesses factual QA consistency across languages; Phase 2 probes geopolitically sensitive disputes. Uses a manually curated multilingual dataset.

Result: Phase 1 shows query language-induced alignment; Phase 2 reveals interplay between model training and query language.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for evaluating LLM behavior in neutral and sensitive topics, aiding culturally aware deployment and multilingual evaluation.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
linguistic and cultural contexts, understanding their behavior in both factual
and disputable scenarios is essential, especially when their outputs may shape
public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two
types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and
inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase
evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single
verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across
different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically
sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or
ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset
spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question
types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,
while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and
query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM
behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM
deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.

*Ernie Chang,Yang Li,Patrick Huber,David Kant,Yangyang Shi,Vikas Chandra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using checkpoint models from training trajectories to optimize data mixtures for language model training, improving performance by up to 1.93% on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to model the relationship between data and tasks for optimal training mixtures, leading to underutilized checkpoint models.

Method: Leverage checkpoint models' capabilities by aggregating their first-order influence approximations over source data to act as data mixers.

Result: Demonstrated significant improvements (up to 1.93%) on eight reasoning benchmarks in pretraining settings.

Conclusion: Checkpoint models can enhance data quality and optimize mixtures, showing untapped potential in training trajectories.

Abstract: In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities
from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right
data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks
is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models
exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory.
Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are
under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these
artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and
leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence
approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks
that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining
setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the
potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data
mixtures.

*Junho Myung,Yeon Su Park,Sunwoo Kim,Shin Yoo,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PapersPlease, a benchmark with 3,700 moral dilemmas to evaluate LLMs' decision-making biases in immigration scenarios, revealing implicit preferences and identity-based biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate biases in LLMs' decision-making, especially in role-playing scenarios like immigration inspections, using moral dilemmas based on human needs theory.

Method: LLMs act as immigration inspectors evaluating entry approvals/denials for narratives constructed using ERG theory (Existence, Relatedness, Growth). Six LLMs were analyzed for decision patterns and identity-based biases.

Result: LLMs showed statistically significant implicit preferences. Some models exhibited higher denial rates for marginalized identities, indicating responsiveness to social identity cues.

Conclusion: The study highlights biases in LLMs' decision-making, influenced by human needs hierarchies and social identities, with implications for fairness in AI applications.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance and biases of large language models (LLMs) through
role-playing scenarios is becoming increasingly common, as LLMs often exhibit
biased behaviors in these contexts. Building on this line of research, we
introduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed
to investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human
needs. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to
approve or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives
are constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory,
which categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of
six LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making,
suggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation
of the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows
varying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with
some models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities. All
data is publicly available at https://github.com/yeonsuuuu28/papers-please.

### [81] [More Vulnerable than You Think: On the Stability of Tool-Integrated LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21967)
*Weimin Xiong,Ke Wang,Yifan Song,Hanchao Liu,Sai Zhou,Wei Peng,Sujian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the stability of tool-integrated LLM agents, revealing vulnerabilities in tool invocation processes and comparing open-source vs. proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations overlook agent stability, limiting real-world applicability due to potential crashes or abnormal behavior.

Method: Investigates agent vulnerabilities across tool documentation reading, tool selection, parameter generation, and response processing.

Result: Agents are error-prone at each stage; open-source models are more vulnerable. Larger models don't improve reasoning and may increase attack susceptibility.

Conclusion: Stability evaluation is crucial for LLM agents, providing insights for future development and assessment.

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on
end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits
their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can
cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by
investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire
tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools
and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through
extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors
at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than
those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size
does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents
more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights
the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for
future LLM development and evaluation.

### [82] [Advancing Jailbreak Strategies: A Hybrid Approach to Exploiting LLM Vulnerabilities and Bypassing Modern Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21972)
*Mohamed Ahmed,Mohamed Abdelmouty,Mingyu Kim,Gunvanth Kandula,Alex Park,James C. Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces hybrid jailbreak methods (GCG + PAIR and GCG + WordGame) combining token- and prompt-level attacks to exploit vulnerabilities in PTLMs, achieving higher success rates and bypassing advanced defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTLMs and LLMs are vulnerable to attacks despite safety measures. Existing token- and prompt-level jailbreaks have complementary limitations, motivating the need for hybrid approaches.

Method: Proposes two hybrid techniques: GCG + PAIR and GCG + WordGame, integrating token- and prompt-level attacks. Evaluated on Vicuna and Llama models.

Result: GCG + PAIR achieved 91.6% ASR on Llama-3, surpassing PAIR's 58.4%. GCG + WordGame maintained over 80% ASR under strict evaluators. Both hybrids bypassed advanced defenses like Gradient Cuff and JBShield.

Conclusion: Hybrid methods expose new vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for holistic safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications.
Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit
their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary
inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks.
Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box
models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token
optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs
to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be
unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we
propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques
to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the
newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and
Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its
constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its
Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's
58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of
WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like
Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and
reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which
fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported
vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw
success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic
safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

*Simon MÃ¼nker,Nils Schwager,Achim Rettinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs to simulate social network user behavior, emphasizing the need for rigorous validation of such simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conflicting findings on LLMs mimicking human behavior necessitate a deeper understanding of experimental designs for social simulations.

Method: The study provides a formal framework for social network simulation and tests approaches to imitate user communication on X in English and German.

Result: Findings highlight the importance of validating simulations by empirical realism in their fitted settings.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for more rigor in generative-agent-based modeling for social simulations.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered
a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical
studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have
been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds,
there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental
designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the
use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we
provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before
focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test
different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our
findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical
realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted.
With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based
modeling for social simulation.

*Kartheek Kumar Reddy Nareddy,Sarah Ternus,Julia Niebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper improves transcription accuracy for cockpit conversations using Whisper models, reducing WER from 68.49% to 26.26% via normalization and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models struggle with niche domains like cockpit speech due to specialized vocabulary and multilingual content.

Method: Collected and labeled cockpit recordings, proposed normalization schemes, and fine-tuned Whisper models using LoRA.

Result: WER dropped significantly from 68.49% to 26.26% after fine-tuning and normalization.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning and normalization effectively enhance ASR performance for niche domains like cockpit conversations.

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to
significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The
pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few
epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong
generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does
suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the
cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual
conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy
of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85
minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings
with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men
speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we
propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve
Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,
utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without
normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the
proposed normalization scheme).

*Delu Kong,Lieve Macken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates machine (MT) vs. human (HT) translations in English-to-Chinese children's literature using stylometric analysis. Results show LLMs align closer to HTs in style than NMTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the stylistic performance of MTs (NMTs and LLMs) compared to HTs in children's literature translation.

Method: Constructed a Peter Pan corpus with 21 translations (7 HTs, 7 LLMs, 7 NMTs). Analyzed 447 linguistic features (generic and CTT-specific) using classification and clustering.

Result: HTs and MTs differ in conjunction word distributions; LLMs outperform NMTs in stylistic alignment with HTs.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential in children's literature translation, aligning more closely with human stylistic traits than NMTs.

Abstract: This study focuses on evaluating the performance of machine translations
(MTs) compared to human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's
literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. The research
constructs a Peter Pan corpus, comprising 21 translations: 7 human translations
(HTs), 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine
translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis employs a generic feature set
(including lexical, syntactic, readability, and n-gram features) and a creative
text translation (CTT-specific) feature set, which captures repetition, rhythm,
translatability, and miscellaneous levels, yielding 447 linguistic features in
total.
  Using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, we
conduct a stylometric analysis of these translations. Results reveal that in
generic features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction
word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs
show significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios.
Regarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning
more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential
of LLMs in CLT.

*Delu Kong,Lieve Macken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study identifies Machine Translationese (MTese) in English-to-Chinese news texts, using a large dataset and a five-layer feature set. It distinguishes original Chinese from MT outputs and compares NMTs and LLMs, noting linguistic patterns like shorter sentences and adversative conjunctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the linguistic peculiarities of machine translation outputs (MTese) in the under-researched English-to-Chinese language pair, particularly in news texts.

Method: Constructed a large dataset with 4 sub-corpora, used a five-layer feature set, and applied a chi-square ranking algorithm for feature selection in classification and clustering tasks.

Result: Confirmed MTese presence in NMTs and LLMs. Original Chinese texts were distinguishable from MT outputs. Notable patterns included shorter sentences and more adversative conjunctions in MT outputs. LLMs showed greater lexical diversity, while NMTs used more brackets.

Conclusion: MTese is evident in English-to-Chinese translations, with distinct patterns in NMTs and LLMs. No significant differences were found between Chinese and foreign LLMs.

Abstract: This study explores Machine Translationese (MTese) -- the linguistic
peculiarities of machine translation outputs -- focusing on the
under-researched English-to-Chinese language pair in news texts. We construct a
large dataset consisting of 4 sub-corpora and employ a comprehensive five-layer
feature set. Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature
selection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the
presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly
distinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in
MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative
conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%
classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and
NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower
lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic
LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by
Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of the first reasoning step in LLMs on final predictions, proposes a sampling strategy to improve efficiency, and introduces a benchmark for evaluating self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored self-correction abilities of LLMs during long chain-of-thought reasoning and the issue of overthinking.

Method: Empirical analysis of reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3), a reward-based sampling strategy to optimize first reasoning steps, and creation of a benchmark with flawed reasoning steps.

Result: The first reasoning step significantly affects final predictions; the proposed strategy reduces inference cost by 70% without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of initial reasoning steps and provides tools for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as
backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments,
the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain
underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models
often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically
show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence
on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially
degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed
across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1
and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that
leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning
steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in
inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new
benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning
steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a
foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

Result: The annotated MDC-R corpus is presented, with analysis showing its potential for linguistic research, particularly in reference comprehension.

Conclusion: MDC-R is a valuable resource for studying reference in dialogue, supported by empirical evidence of its utility.

Abstract: We introduce the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus with Reference (MDC-R). MDC-R is a
new language resource that supplements the original Minecraft Dialogue Corpus
(MDC) with expert annotations of anaphoric and deictic reference. MDC's
task-orientated, multi-turn, situated dialogue in a dynamic environment has
motivated multiple annotation efforts, owing to the interesting linguistic
phenomena that this setting gives rise to. We believe it can serve as a
valuable resource when annotated with reference, too. Here, we discuss our
method of annotation and the resulting corpus, and provide both a quantitative
and a qualitative analysis of the data. Furthermore, we carry out a short

TL;DR: The paper analyzes linguistic complexity in Twitter content on COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war, revealing variations based on account type, political leaning, reliability, and sentiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language on social media reflects societal and ideological structures, focusing on influential users and contested topics.

Method: Combined multiple textual complexity measures to analyze Twitter content across four dimensions: account type, political leaning, reliability, and sentiment.

Result: Significant linguistic differences were found across all dimensions, with more complex language in negative/offensive content and convergence in jargon among politically aligned users.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into sociolinguistic dynamics on digital platforms, highlighting how language mirrors ideological and social structures online.

Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in
response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural
interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed
communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges
entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms
reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated
content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this
paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential
users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics:
COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of
textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key
dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and
sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,
including variations in language complexity between individuals and
organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and
between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.
Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to
use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and
reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new
insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute
to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social
structures in online spaces.

TL;DR: The study isolates a sub-network in GPT-2 Small responsible for subject-verb agreement, identifying a small but effective circuit for verb conjugation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how GPT-2 Small processes subject-verb agreement by isolating the specific sub-network involved.

Method: Used performance verification, automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit attribution to identify the circuit.

Result: A small fraction of the network's component-token pairs suffices for near-model performance on verb conjugation, but more is needed for complex tasks.

Conclusion: The identified circuit is crucial for subject-verb agreement, highlighting the efficiency of GPT-2's architecture for specific linguistic tasks.

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or
"circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this
study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g.
"Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict
the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural
subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification
automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit
attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to
the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small
fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model
performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

TL;DR: DAPFAM is a new domain-aware patent retrieval dataset addressing gaps in existing datasets by offering explicit labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage, and manageable size for sub-document experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing patent retrieval datasets lack explicit in-domain/out-of-domain labeling, balanced query domains, and manageable sizes for moderate computational resources.

Method: DAPFAM is constructed at the simple-family level with 1,247 domain-balanced queries and 45,336 target families, enriched with relevance judgments and IPC-based labeling.

Result: The dataset includes 49,869 evaluation pairs, supports sub-document retrieval, and baseline experiments reveal challenges in cross-domain patent retrieval.

Conclusion: DAPFAM fills critical gaps in patent retrieval datasets and is publicly available for research.

Abstract: In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need
for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage,
balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub
document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often
overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access
domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level.
The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336
full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments
(forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as
explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed
labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes,
resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional,
requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a
size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document
level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe
our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset
statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval
methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in
crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now

TL;DR: The paper explores speech SSL models for dialectal Arabic and Arabic-English code-switched speech, introducing data augmentation and fine-tuning methods to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and improve performance on dialectal Arabic and code-switched speech tasks.

Method: Proposes a modified audio-splicing approach (SAGE) for artificial CS data and an Experience Replay (ER) method for generalization.

Result: Achieves absolute WER improvements (7.8% on CS benchmarks) and outperforms larger models (5.5% and 8.4% better than USM and Whisper-large-v2).

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address data scarcity and improve performance on dialectal Arabic and code-switched speech tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of various speech SSL models on
dialectal Arabic (DA) and Arabic-English code-switched (CS) speech. To address
data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate
artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the
proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement
on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks.
Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to
enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the
overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching
benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%. A WER of 31.1% on Arabic-English CS
benchmarks surpasses large-scale multilingual models, including USM and
Whisper-large-v2 (both over ten times larger) by an absolute margin of 5.5% and
8.4%, respectively.

Conclusion: RCO enhances LLM critique-refinement loops by focusing on meaningful critiques, validated by comprehensive experiments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and
critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in
various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques
are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such
critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented
\textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to
train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where
critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its
responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these
refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By
focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need
for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving
meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,
dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,
and code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional
methods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement
outcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel
supervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive
experimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM
critique-refinement loops.

### [94] [Leveraging In-Context Learning for Political Bias Testing of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22232)
*Patrick Haller,Jannis Vamvas,Rico Sennrich,Lena A. JÃ¤ger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Questionnaire Modeling (QM) to improve bias evaluation in LLMs using human survey data, showing better stability and enabling comparisons between instruction-tuned and base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating political biases in LLMs lack stability, making model comparisons unreliable.

Method: Proposes QM, a probing task using human survey data as in-context examples to evaluate bias.

Result: QM improves evaluation stability; instruction tuning can alter bias direction, and larger models use context better with smaller bias scores.

Conclusion: QM offers a more reliable way to assess LLM biases, with implications for model comparison and bias mitigation.

Abstract: A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to
evaluate their potential biases. However, this probing method has limited
stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we
argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire
Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that
QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate
that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions.
Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can
indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that
larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and
generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly
available.

### [95] [Detection of Personal Data in Structured Datasets Using a Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22305)
*Albert Agisha Ntwali,Luca RÃ¼ck,Martin Heckmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel GPT-4o-based method for detecting personal data in structured datasets outperforms alternatives like CASSED and Microsoft Presidio, especially when leveraging contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personal data detection in structured datasets by incorporating contextual information, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Uses GPT-4o to analyze feature names, values, and contextual information from dataset descriptions and other features. Evaluated against CASSED and Microsoft Presidio on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: GPT-4o-based approach outperforms others, particularly in datasets where contextual information is beneficial. CASSED performs well on its training dataset but poorly elsewhere.

Conclusion: More real-world datasets with personal information are needed to advance the field.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for detecting personal data in structured
datasets, leveraging GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model. A key
innovation of our method is the incorporation of contextual information: in
addition to a feature's name and values, we utilize information from other
feature names within the dataset as well as the dataset description. We compare
our approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED,
evaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset,
datasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a
real-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.
  Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending
on the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on
which it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is
comparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly
outperforming the others. Notably, personal data detection in the Kaggle and
OpenML datasets appears to benefit from contextual information. This is
evidenced by the poor performance of CASSED and Presidio (both of which do not
utilize the context of the dataset) compared to the strong results of our
GPT-4o-based approach.
  We conclude that further progress in this field would greatly benefit from
the availability of more real-world datasets containing personal information.

### [96] [Evaluating Scoring Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22316)
*Qingquan Li,Shaoyu Dou,Kailai Shao,Chao Chen,Haixiang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge systems, proposing a framework to evaluate and mitigate such biases, and highlights their impact on fairness and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of LLMs as evaluators (LLM-as-a-Judge) introduces biases, particularly in scoring-based evaluations, which lack systematic study. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors define scoring bias, construct an evaluation dataset via data synthesis, and design multi-faceted metrics to assess bias in judge models.

Result: Experiments show scoring biases disrupt judge models' stability. Insights are provided on prompt design and bias mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for addressing scoring biases in LLM-as-a-Judge systems and offers practical guidance for improving fairness and reliability.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise
to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks.
Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language
Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However,
there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the
fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or
mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based
evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based
evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and
provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We
augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct
our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge
models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and
discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt
templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score
rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

### [97] [Why Are Parsing Actions for Understanding Message Hierarchies Not Random?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22366)
*Daichi Kato,Ryo Ueda,Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores why human parsing strategies aren't random by testing random parsing in agents with hierarchical biases and modified experimental setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why human parsing strategies deviate from randomness, given that random parsing can achieve high communication accuracy in some models.

Method: Modify the experimental setup with (I) complex hierarchical inputs and (II) a surprisal-related term in the objective function, then evaluate communication accuracy of random parsing agents.

Result: The study assesses whether random parsing strategies retain high accuracy under these modified conditions.

Conclusion: The findings aim to clarify the role of randomness in parsing and its divergence from human strategies.

Abstract: If humans understood language by randomly selecting parsing actions, it might
have been necessary to construct a robust symbolic system capable of being
interpreted under any hierarchical structure. However, human parsing strategies
do not seem to follow such a random pattern. Why is that the case? In fact, a
previous study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases
have reported that agents adopting random parsing
strategies$\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language
comprehension$\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this
study, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications
to the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have
hierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation
more difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is
known to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into
the objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents
employing random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy.

### [98] [QuickSilver -- Speeding up LLM Inference through Dynamic Token Halting, KV Skipping, Contextual Token Fusion, and Adaptive Matryoshka Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22396)
*Danush Khanna,Aditya Kumar Guru,Srivarshinee Sridhar,Zidan Ahmed,Rubhav Bahirwani,Meetu Malhotra,Vinija Jain,Aman Chadha,Amitava Das,Kripabandhu Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QuickSilver is a token-level framework for runtime optimization of LLMs, reducing FLOPs by up to 39.6% with minimal perplexity impact, without altering model weights or structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference latency and energy consumption dominate LLM deployment costs, yet runtime optimization remains underdeveloped compared to training efficiency. Existing methods often require retraining or architectural changes.

Method: QuickSilver uses three mechanisms: Dynamic Token Halting, KV Cache Skipping, and Contextual Token Fusion, all operating on frozen models without auxiliary networks.

Result: Achieves up to 39.6% FLOP reduction with <=0.2 perplexity degradation on GPT-2 and Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4.

Conclusion: QuickSilver offers a modular, efficient solution for LLM inference optimization without compromising model integrity or performance.

Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in
large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.
While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime
optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive
decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,
and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or
disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,
token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time
without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four
synergistic mechanisms:
  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged
representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory
writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which
collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.
  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on
frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and
Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP
reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance Czech GEC by leveraging synthetic error generation and evaluating large language models (LLMs) for performance and efficiency.

Method: Transformer-based neural network with real-time synthetic error generation, domain balancing, and fine-tuning experiments.

Result: Best-performing model excels in performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The system sets a new benchmark for Czech GEC, with code and models publicly available.

Abstract: We present a grammar error correction (GEC) system that achieves state of the
art for the Czech language. Our system is based on a neural network translation
approach with the Transformer architecture, and its key feature is its
real-time synthetic generation pipeline, which dynamically augments sentences
with artificial errors by introducing both language-agnostic and Czech-specific
errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the
Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error
generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size,
and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert
fine-tuning scenarios. Our best-performing model is superior both in
performance and computational efficiency. The source code and the trained model

TL;DR: HyperCLOVA X THINK is a reasoning-focused large language model, pre-trained on 6 trillion Korean and English tokens, with competitive performance on Korean benchmarks and robust bilingual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a high-performance, bilingual (Korean-English) language model with efficient training compute and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Pre-trained using a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN Transformer with a three-stage curriculum (128K context window) and post-trained via supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning.

Result: Competitive performance on Korean benchmarks (KMMLU, CSAT, etc.), robust bilingual consistency, and vision-augmented variant matching GPT-4.1 on KCSAT STEM.

Conclusion: HyperCLOVA X THINK is a strong foundation for Korean AI innovation and a valuable resource globally, with plans for open-source and business-friendly deployment.

Abstract: We introduce HyperCLOVA X THINK, the first reasoning-focused large language
model in the HyperCLOVA X family, pre-trained on roughly $6$ trillion
high-quality Korean, and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic
Korean data. It was implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN
Transformer scaled with $\mu$P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum
that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via
supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards
supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers
competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused
benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while
preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a
vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM
benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute
than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and
distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an
open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these
capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI
innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark and MAI-DxO, an AI orchestrator, to improve diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness in medicine, achieving 80% accuracy and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of AI in medicine lack real-world complexity. The paper aims to emulate the iterative diagnostic process of physicians.

Method: Developed the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark using NEJM-CPC cases and MAI-DxO, a model-agnostic orchestrator for strategic testing and diagnosis.

Result: MAI-DxO achieved 80% diagnostic accuracy (4x higher than physicians) and reduced costs by 20% compared to physicians, 70% vs. off-the-shelf models.

Conclusion: AI systems like MAI-DxO, designed for iterative reasoning, can enhance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in clinical care.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert
medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models
rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the
complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In
clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic
hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just
learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final
diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential
Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New
England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases
into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case
abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper
model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is
assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician
visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator
(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,
proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,
cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%
diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist
physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to
physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum
accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO
generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and
Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively
and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in
clinical care.

TL;DR: SpatialReasoner-R1 improves fine-grained spatial reasoning in VLMs using M3CTS for diverse reasoning trajectories and fDPO for segment-specific preference optimization, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning, especially in multi-step logic and precise alignment tasks.

Method: Introduced M3CTS for generating diverse reasoning trajectories and fDPO for fine-grained preference optimization with spatial rewards.

Result: fDPO improves spatial quality tasks by 4.1% and quantity tasks by 9.0%. SpatialReasoner-R1 sets a new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming baselines by 9.8%.

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner-R1 addresses spatial reasoning limitations in VLMs, achieving superior performance while maintaining general task competitiveness.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial
reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are
required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language
reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct
high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte
Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent
Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose
fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces
segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical
reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate
responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical
coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average
improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0%
gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a
new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in
average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general
vision-language tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TanDiT introduces a unified diffusion model for panoramic image generation, addressing distortion and loop-consistency challenges with tangent-plane grids and post-processing for coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image generation models struggle with panoramic images due to geometric distortions and loop-consistency requirements.

Method: TanDiT generates tangent-plane image grids using a unified diffusion model in one denoising iteration, with a post-processing step for global coherence.

Result: The method generalizes well, handles complex prompts, and integrates with other models to produce high-quality panoramas.

Conclusion: TanDiT effectively addresses panoramic generation challenges and introduces specialized metrics for evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in
synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with
panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels
of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To
address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we
introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating
grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike
previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a
unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images
simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a
model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global
coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image
quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and
provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and
standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets
detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various
generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a training-free visual cropping method for fine-grained VQA, leveraging MLLM-internal representations to efficiently identify and analyze relevant image regions, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current visual cropping techniques in fine-grained VQA, such as task-specific fine-tuning, inefficiency, and incompatibility with attention mechanisms.

Method: FOCUS identifies target objects in prompts, computes an object relevance map using KV cache, ranks relevant regions, and performs VQA on the top-ranked region.

Result: FOCUS achieves strong performance on four datasets, outperforming three baselines in accuracy and efficiency, and matches ZoomEye with 3-6.5x less compute.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides an efficient, training-free solution for fine-grained VQA, leveraging MLLM representations to improve performance and reduce computational costs.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and
reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA)
focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual
cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:
the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed
exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.
We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping
method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the
search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:
first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute
an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and
rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the
fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed
search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA
datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping
methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing
baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified CAST model using cross-attention to fuse spatial and temporal features for deepfake detection, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes pose a threat to digital media authenticity, necessitating advanced detection techniques that address subtle, time-dependent manipulations.

Method: The CAST model leverages cross-attention to dynamically integrate spatial (CNN) and temporal (Transformer) features, improving detection of fine-grained artifacts.

Result: The model achieves 99.49% AUC and 97.57% accuracy in intra-dataset tests and 93.31% AUC in cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: Cross-attention-based feature fusion enhances deepfake detection robustness, as demonstrated by superior performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity,
increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle
and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial
artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.
However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal
features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use
separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine
them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which
limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we
propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse
spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows
temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing
the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as
flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization
and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across
diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model
using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both
intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.
Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an
accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset
testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent
AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the
effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the
robustness of deepfake video detection.

*Xin Lu,Xueyang Fu,Jie Xiao,Zihao Fan,Yurui Zhu,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating diffusion training paradigms into general image restoration (IR) frameworks, addressing limitations of existing methods by optimizing time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, and noise-level relationships. It introduces regularization strategies and task-specific adaptors to enhance performance in single- and multi-task IR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for IR are limited by complex architectures and lack integration with general IR frameworks. The paper aims to bridge this gap by adapting diffusion training paradigms to improve IR performance.

Method: The paper systematically analyzes key principles (time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, etc.) and introduces regularization strategies and task-specific adaptors. It also proposes an incremental training paradigm for multi-task IR.

Result: The method improves generalization in single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR, seamlessly integrating into existing IR architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines diffusion-based training with general IR, enhancing performance and adaptability across single- and multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image
restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes
limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based
general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing
network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the
diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address
these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the
diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis
of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and
multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by
diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore
images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of
regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,
improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing
that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR
tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,
further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in
single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.
Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing
general IR architectures.

TL;DR: AsymDSD is a self-supervised learning framework for 3D point clouds that combines masked modeling and invariance learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of learning meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point clouds without large labeled datasets motivates the need for improved self-supervised methods.

Method: AsymDSD uses an asymmetric dual self-distillation framework, latent space prediction, and key design choices like multi-mask sampling and attention disabling.

Result: Achieves 90.53% accuracy on ScanObjectNN and 93.72% with pretraining on 930k shapes, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: AsymDSD effectively unifies masked modeling and invariance learning, advancing self-supervised 3D representation learning.

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point
clouds remains a central challenge in computer vision, especially in the
absence of large-scale labeled datasets. While masked point modeling (MPM) is
widely used in self-supervised 3D learning, its reconstruction-based objective
can limit its ability to capture high-level semantics. We propose AsymDSD, an
Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework that unifies masked modeling and
invariance learning through prediction in the latent space rather than the
input space. AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces
several key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention
between masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a
point cloud adaptation of multi-crop. AsymDSD achieves state-of-the-art results
on ScanObjectNN (90.53%) and further improves to 93.72% when pretrained on 930k

### [108] [Exploring Image Generation via Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces and Local Correlation Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21731)
*Chenqiu Zhao,Anup Basu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MESP and LCH frameworks to address memorization in generative models, proposing BL-AE and ARVM for improved performance, but highlights memorization issues despite competitive FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of probabilistic generative models where learning global distributions leads to memorization instead of true generative behavior.

Method: Proposes MESP from VAE analysis, introduces BL-AE for binary latent encoding, and ARVM for histogram output. LCH is introduced to emphasize local correlations for generative capability.

Result: ARVM achieves competitive FID scores but reveals memorization. LCH is validated through experiments.

Conclusion: MESP and LCH provide insights into generative model limitations, with LCH offering a potential solution through local correlations.

Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability
Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential
limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global
distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP
emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe
that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an
optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A
lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this
phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary
Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent
representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our
Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model
outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect
memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the
Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability
arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive
experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

*Sirnam Swetha,Rohit Gupta,Parth Parag Kulkarni,David G Shatwell,Jeffrey A Chan Santiago,Nyle Siddiqui,Joseph Fioresi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ImplicitQA, a benchmark for testing implicit reasoning in VideoQA, highlighting the limitations of current systems in handling creative and cinematic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA benchmarks focus on explicit visual content, missing the implicit reasoning humans use in narrative-driven videos.

Method: The authors created ImplicitQA, a dataset of 1K QA pairs from 320+ creative video clips, annotated for key reasoning dimensions.

Result: Evaluations show performance drops in leading VideoQA models, revealing their reliance on surface-level cues and difficulty with implicit reasoning.

Conclusion: ImplicitQA aims to advance research in human-like understanding for VideoQA by addressing implicit reasoning gaps.

Abstract: Video QA has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to
align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly
focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,
objects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.
In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and
narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately
omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and
relationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such
implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context
to construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail
to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this
gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test
models on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs
derived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized
into key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth
and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and
motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred
counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors
ensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models
reveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level
visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. Performance
variations across models further illustrate the complexity and diversity of the
challenges presented by ImplicitQA. By releasing both the dataset and our data
collection framework, we aim to stimulate further research and development in
the community. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.

Conclusion: The pipeline is reproducible, scalable, and clinically promising for early glaucoma detection.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection
can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods
are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present
a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma
detection from retinal fundus images. Unlike prior studies that rely on single
datasets, we sequentially train and fine-tune our model across ACRIMA, ORIGA,
and RIM-ONE datasets to enhance generalization. Our experiments show that
minimal preprocessing yields higher AUC-ROC compared to more complex
enhancements, and our model demonstrates strong discriminative performance on
unseen datasets. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible and scalable
approach to early glaucoma detection, supporting its potential clinical
utility.

Motivation: To evaluate and advance computer vision techniques for egocentric video understanding, addressing the gap in performance compared to third-person videos.

Method: Assessed Shotluck Holmes (supervised), TAC-SUM (unsupervised), and GPT-4o (prompt fine-tuned) on egocentric video summarization using a subset of the Ego-Exo4D dataset.

Result: GPT-4o outperformed specialized models, revealing current state-of-the-art models' limitations in adapting to first-person perspectives.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for further advancements in egocentric video analysis and suggests prompt fine-tuned general-purpose models as a promising direction.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate various computer vision paradigms - supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, and prompt fine-tuning - by assessing their
ability to understand and interpret egocentric video data. Specifically, we
examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM
(state-of-the-art unsupervised learning), and GPT-4o (a prompt fine-tuned
pre-trained model), evaluating their effectiveness in video summarization. Our
results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models perform less
effectively on first-person videos compared to third-person videos,
highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain.
Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these
specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in
adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our
evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the
Ego-Exo4D dataset due to resource constraints, the primary objective of this
research is to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept analysis aimed at
advancing the application of computer vision techniques to first-person videos.
By exploring novel methodologies and evaluating their potential, we aim to
contribute to the ongoing development of models capable of effectively
processing and interpreting egocentric perspectives.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CAT-SG dataset and CatSGG model to comprehensively model cataract surgery workflows, improving surgical phase and technique recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack comprehensive representations of semantic relationships in cataract surgery workflows.

Method: The CAT-SG dataset provides structured annotations of tool-tissue interactions and temporal dependencies, while the CatSGG model generates scene graphs for surgical representations.

Result: CatSGG outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical representations.

Conclusion: CAT-SG and CatSGG advance AI-driven surgical training and decision support, enabling context-aware systems in clinical practice.

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling
complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and
procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of
surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack
comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between
entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph
(CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue
interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By
incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of
surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and
techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model,
CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical
representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical
training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for

Result: Outperforms benchmarks (+5% to +20% mIoU) and achieves 67.3% PQ on ICDAR 2021, even in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: The method reduces manual annotation needs and advances automated historical map analysis.

Abstract: As rich sources of history, maps provide crucial insights into historical
changes, yet their diverse visual representations and limited annotated data
pose significant challenges for automated processing. We propose a simple yet
effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the
rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on
the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving

in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong
performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3%
for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this
shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our
approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- &
5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the

choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene
backdrops that incorporate personalized characters. A user study demonstrated
heightened engagement and ownership when individuals appeared as protagonists.
Participants praised the system's real-time previews and intuitive controls,
though they requested finer narrative editing tools. TaleForge advances
multimodal storytelling by aligning personalized text and imagery to create

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrefPaint integrates human feedback into Stable Diffusion Inpainting for medical imaging, improving accuracy and reliability without costly reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inpainting models in medical imaging, like polyps, often produce inaccurate results, risking diagnosis errors. Expert annotation and feedback are needed for reliable training.

Method: PrefPaint incorporates human feedback directly into Stable Diffusion Inpainting training, using a web interface for streamlined feedback and fine-tuning.

Result: PrefPaint reduces visual inconsistencies and enhances image rendering, especially in medical contexts, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PrefPaint offers a practical solution for reliable inpainting in medical imaging by leveraging human feedback, improving accuracy and usability.

Abstract: Inpainting, the process of filling missing or corrupted image parts, has
broad applications, including medical imaging. However, in specialized fields
like medical polyps imaging, where accuracy and reliability are critical,
inpainting models can generate inaccurate images, leading to significant errors
in medical diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliability, medical images
should be annotated by experts like oncologists for effective model training.
We propose PrefPaint, an approach that incorporates human feedback into the
training process of Stable Diffusion Inpainting, bypassing the need for
computationally expensive reward models. In addition, we develop a web-based
interface streamlines training, fine-tuning, and inference. This interactive
interface provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easier to
offer feedback and manage the fine-tuning process. User study on various
domains shows that PrefPaint outperforms existing methods, reducing visual
inconsistencies and improving image rendering, particularly in medical
contexts, where our model generates more realistic polyps images.

*Xiaoqi Wang,Clint Sebastian,Wenbin He,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProSAM improves visual reference segmentation by using a variational prompt encoder to avoid unstable prompt regions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based methods for visual reference segmentation generate unstable prompts at object boundaries due to suboptimal encoders, limiting robustness.

Method: ProSAM introduces a variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, avoiding unstable regions.

Result: ProSAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets.

Conclusion: ProSAM provides a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation by addressing prompt instability.

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of
open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond
predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes,
texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its
unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several
SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically
generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts
at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in
instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple
but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in
existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a
variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM
avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the
instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets,
providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical multi-agent framework with stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning, layout synthesis, and local image editing. Agents collaborate iteratively for coherence and solvability.

Result: Agent collaboration enhances output quality in solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance clarity while preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves the generation of escape room puzzle images by combining structured reasoning and iterative agent collaboration.

Abstract: We challenge text-to-image models with generating escape room puzzle images
that are visually appealing, logically solid, and intellectually stimulating.
While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance
reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this
task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning,
layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate
through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and
functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves
output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance
clarity, while maintaining visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel EEG encoder with a dual self-attention mechanism to reconstruct 3D objects from EEG data, addressing noise and dataset scarcity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EEG-to-image methods neglect 3D reconstruction, limiting BCI applications. The brain processes 3D spatial information, making 3D reconstruction more practical.

Method: A hybrid training strategy combines cross-attention, contrastive learning, and self-supervised learning. Stable diffusion and Variational Score Distillation are used to train a neural radiation field for 3D generation.

Result: The method successfully generates 3D objects with content and structure similar to the EEG data.

Conclusion: The approach advances EEG-based 3D reconstruction, offering potential for improved BCIs and communication aids.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds
significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and
aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have
focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation
of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain
inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of
whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured
by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when
reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.
The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable
obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and
a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which
complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this
challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that
integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy
to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning,
and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable
diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation
to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with
similar content and structure from EEG data.

TL;DR: Proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pairs using a Channel-wise Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM) to reduce storage and transmission costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing modalities like RGB-IR pairs double storage and transmission costs, necessitating efficient compression.

Method: Introduces CCEM with Low-frequency Context Extraction and Fusion Blocks (LCEB & LCFB) for cross-modality entropy modeling.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, achieving 23.1% bit rate savings on LLVIP dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively compresses RGB-IR pairs by leveraging cross-modality information.

Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in
various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of
modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also
double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work
proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to
fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability
modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise
Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context
Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are
designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information
from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters
more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and
KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate
saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec
presented at CVPR 2022.

TL;DR: A self-supervised method learns periodic signals from facial videos for rPPG estimation, using masked autoencoders and physiological constraints, achieving strong cross-dataset performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) by learning general periodic signal representations from unlabeled facial videos, capturing subtle skin tone changes.

Method: Uses a video masked autoencoder for spatio-temporal representation, frame masking for periodicity, and physiological bandlimit constraints to guide pulse extraction.

Result: Shows significant performance gains, especially in cross-dataset evaluations on PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and V4V datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively learns periodic signals for rPPG, enhancing performance and generalizability.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that learns a general representation of
periodic signals from unlabeled facial videos by capturing subtle changes in
skin tone over time. The proposed framework employs the video masked
autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional spatio-temporal representation of the
facial region through self-supervised learning. Capturing quasi-periodic
signals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
estimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms
of video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic
signals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates
physiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological
signals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to
the model. The pre-trained encoder is then transferred to the rPPG task, where
it is used to extract physiological signals from facial videos. We evaluate the
proposed method through extensive experiments on the PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and
V4V datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements,
particularly in challenging cross-dataset evaluations. Our code is available at

Result: Demonstrates superior few-shot performance on 14 downstream tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SPADE highlights the benefits of combining morphological and molecular data in a single latent space.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep

integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the
comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial

heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce
SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide
image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an
ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique,
where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive
learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene
expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is
evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot

TL;DR: LLaVA-Scissor is a training-free token compression method for video multimodal LLMs, using Semantic Connected Components (SCC) for better semantic coverage and reduced redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token compression methods based on attention scores often miss semantic regions and cause redundancy.

Method: Uses SCC to assign tokens to distinct semantic regions, enabling a two-step spatio-temporal compression strategy.

Result: Outperforms other methods in video benchmarks, especially at low token retention ratios.

Conclusion: LLaVA-Scissor effectively compresses tokens while maintaining semantic coverage, improving video understanding performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression
strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods
mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to
effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy.
Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC)
approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set,
ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step
spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial
and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by
representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We
conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of
LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video
question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor
outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in
various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention

Method: Introduces Semantic Augmentation Module for multi-level feature alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling for hierarchical semantic understanding.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements in RS tasks like scene classification and VQA, demonstrating effective bridging of domain gaps.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses RS-specific challenges, enhancing LVLM performance in RS vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
various vision-language tasks in natural image domains. However, their
application to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant
domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These
discrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain
rich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.
Hence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To
address this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS
understanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented
Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align
multi-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic
Augmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics
across fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is
designed to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge
database, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and
multi-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation
across multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design
semantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic
representation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical
semantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple
RS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic
levels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap
between general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language
understanding.

*Yanguang Sun,Jiexi Yan,Jianjun Qian,Chunyan Xu,Jian Yang,Lei Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DPU-Former, a dual-perspective Transformer model for ORSI segmentation, combining long-range dependencies and spatial details efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ORSI segmentation models overlook challenges like feature heterogeneity and high complexity, leading to sub-optimal results.

Method: Introduces DPU-Former with global-local mixed attention, Fourier-space merging, and a gated linear feed-forward network for efficient fusion and expressive power.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: DPU-Former effectively integrates diverse features for superior ORSI segmentation.

Abstract: Automatically segmenting objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs)
is an important task. Most existing models are primarily based on either
convolutional or Transformer features, each offering distinct advantages.
Exploiting both advantages is valuable research, but it presents several
challenges, including the heterogeneity between the two types of features, high
complexity, and large parameters of the model. However, these issues are often
overlooked in existing the ORSIs methods, causing sub-optimal segmentation. For
that, we propose a novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) with
a unique structure designed to simultaneously integrate long-range dependencies
and spatial details. In particular, we design the global-local mixed attention,
which captures diverse information through two perspectives and introduces a
Fourier-space merging strategy to obviate deviations for efficient fusion.
Furthermore, we present a gated linear feed-forward network to increase the
expressive ability. Additionally, we construct a DPU-Former decoder to
aggregate and strength features at different layers. Consequently, the
DPU-Former model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

### [126] [Grounding-Aware Token Pruning: Recovering from Drastic Performance Drops in Visual Grounding Caused by Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21873)
*Tzu-Chun Chien,Chieh-Kai Lin,Shiang-Feng Tsai,Ruei-Chi Lai,Hung-Jen Chen,Min Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of performance degradation in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to token pruning, proposing Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP) to recover accuracy without extra costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token pruning in MLLMs reduces computational costs but severely weakens visual grounding performance, as seen in tasks like Referring Expression Comprehension (REC).

Method: The authors propose GAP, a method to adjust position IDs after pruning, ensuring alignment and recovering grounding performance without additional training or resources.

Result: GAP recovers REC accuracy to 51.42% (90% of original performance) and improves performance across models like Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and LLaVA.

Conclusion: GAP effectively mitigates the negative impact of token pruning on MLLMs, offering a practical solution for maintaining grounding performance without added overhead.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface
for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the
development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs
associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that
pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to
incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of
LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis
identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this
degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for
maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose
Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to
position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the
original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no
additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such
as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves
performance across various token pruning strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using gradient-based interpretability to flag problematic training images improves psoriasis severity scoring model performance by 5% AUC-ROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inter-rater variability and inconsistent annotations hinder reliable automated severity scoring in psoriasis. Remote imaging introduces nonclinical artifacts affecting model performance.

Method: Uses a gradient-based approach to detect training images with spurious correlations or annotation inconsistencies, applied to a ConvNeXT-based weakly supervised model.

Result: Removing 8.2% of flagged images boosts model AUC-ROC from 85% to 90%. The method identifies 90% of inter-rater disagreements by reviewing only the top 30% of samples.

Conclusion: The framework enhances automated psoriasis severity scoring, reducing reliance on manual annotation review and improving robustness against data variability.

Abstract: Psoriasis (PsO) severity scoring is important for clinical trials but is
hindered by inter-rater variability and the burden of in person clinical
evaluation. Remote imaging using patient captured mobile photos offers
scalability but introduces challenges, such as variation in lighting,
background, and device quality that are often imperceptible to humans but can
impact model performance. These factors, along with inconsistencies in
dermatologist annotations, reduce the reliability of automated severity
scoring. We propose a framework to automatically flag problematic training
images that introduce spurious correlations which degrade model generalization,
using a gradient based interpretability approach. By tracing the gradients of
misclassified validation images, we detect training samples where model errors
align with inconsistently rated examples or are affected by subtle, nonclinical
artifacts. We apply this method to a ConvNeXT based weakly supervised model
designed to classify PsO severity from phone images. Removing 8.2% of flagged
images improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.
Commonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation
accuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training
images with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for
manual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two
dermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater
disagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples. This improves automated
scoring for remote assessments, ensuring robustness despite data collection
variability.

potential to enhance system adaptability and robustness. Our work offers
valuable insights into current methods and future directions for multi-sensor

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SODA, a method for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects using 3D vision-language models (VLMs), addressing synthetic-to-real domain shift challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable OOD detection in point cloud data due to increasing applications, combined with the under-explored nature of this problem and the limitations of pre-trained 3D VLMs.

Method: Introduces SODA, a neighborhood-based score propagation scheme for OOD detection, leveraging 3D VLMs without additional training.

Result: SODA outperforms existing methods across datasets and settings, improving OOD detection despite domain shift.

Conclusion: SODA effectively addresses synthetic-to-real domain shift in 3D VLMs, enhancing OOD detection performance without requiring extra training.

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes
critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem
remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image
domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)
for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that
point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size
and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they
often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a
substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks
involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,
our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift
significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text
embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To
address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the
detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation
scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets
and problem settings.

*Fangling Jiang,Qi Li,Weining Wang,Gang Wang,Bing Liu,Zhenan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method using multimodal large language models to improve generalization and interpretability, achieving state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face anti-spoofing methods memorize training data patterns, leading to poor generalization and limited interpretability for unknown attack types.

Method: The method employs reinforcement fine-tuning with verifiable class and reasoning consistent rewards, using GRPO-based optimization to guide reasoning policy exploration.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization, effectively handling diverse unknown attack types and providing interpretable decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances generalization and interpretability in face anti-spoofing without needing labor-intensive textual annotations.

Abstract: Recently the emergence of novel presentation attacks has drawn increasing
attention to face anti-spoofing. However, existing methods tend to memorize
data patterns from the training set, resulting in poor generalization to
unknown attack types across different scenarios and limited interpretability.
To address these challenges, this paper presents a reinforcement
fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method that stimulates the capabilities of
multimodal large language models to think and learn how to solve the
anti-spoofing task itself, rather than relying on the memorization of
authenticity patterns. We design verifiable class consistent reward and
reasoning consistent reward, and employ a GRPO-based optimization strategy to
guide the model in exploring reasoning policies from multiple perspectives to
maximize expected rewards. As a result, through iterative trial-and-error
learning while retaining only high-reward trajectories, the model distills
highly generalizable decision-making rules from the extensive solution space to
effectively address cross-domain face anti-spoofing tasks. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
cross-domain generalization performance. It generalizes well to diverse unknown
attack types in unseen target domains while providing interpretable reasoning
for its authenticity decisions without requiring labor-intensive textual
annotations for training.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transfer learning approach using YOLO for detecting visual elements in lecture videos, addressing challenges like non-standard structures and lack of annotated data. It includes a benchmark dataset and source code for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual elements in lecture videos enhance learning but are hard to detect automatically due to their non-standard structure and lack of annotated datasets.

Method: Evaluated state-of-the-art object detection models, optimized YOLO with multi-dataset training and semi-supervised auto-labeling.

Result: YOLO performed best; the approach improved object detection in lecture videos and provided a general solution.

Conclusion: The paper offers a practical solution and resources (dataset, code) to advance research in lecture video object detection.

Abstract: Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures
supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on
enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,
searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual
elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension,
retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential
for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is
that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is
challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,
tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard
structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be
composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep
learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory
performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity
of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for
detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art
object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video
datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently
YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple
benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.
Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general
solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper
contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video
frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.

*Xinghan Wang,Kun Xu,Fei Li,Cao Sheng,Jiazhong Yu,Yadong Mu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for text-driven human motion generation that incorporates human attributes (e.g., age, gender) alongside action semantics, addressing a gap in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-motion models ignore human attributes, which significantly influence motion patterns. This work aims to bridge that gap.

Method: A Structural Causal Model-inspired framework decouples action semantics from human attributes, enabling attribute-controlled motion generation.

Result: The model generates realistic, attribute-aware motions aligned with text and attribute inputs, validated on the new HumanAttr dataset.

Conclusion: The work pioneers attribute-aware text-to-motion generation, demonstrating effectiveness through experiments and introducing a benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation has recently attracted considerable
attention, allowing models to generate human motions based on textual
descriptions. However, current methods neglect the influence of human
attributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors
shaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for
bridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute
information and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively
with action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural
Causal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,
enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation. The
resulting model is capable of generating realistic, attribute-aware motion
aligned with the user's text and attribute inputs. For evaluation, we introduce
HumanAttr, a comprehensive dataset containing attribute annotations for
text-motion pairs, setting the first benchmark for attribute-aware
text-to-motion generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset validate
our model's effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated reconstruction of table structures from images is crucial for semantic data extraction, but existing methods lack efficiency and robustness.

Method: SepFormer uses a coarse-to-fine approach with two transformer decoders to predict separators, refining from single-line to line-strip segments.

Result: Achieves 25.6 FPS and comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks like SciTSR, PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

Conclusion: SepFormer offers a fast and robust solution for TSR, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple datasets.

Abstract: The automated reconstruction of the logical arrangement of tables from image
data, termed Table Structure Recognition (TSR), is fundamental for semantic
data extraction. Recently, researchers have explored a wide range of techniques
to tackle this problem, demonstrating significant progress. Each table is a set
of vertical and horizontal separators. Following this realization, we present
SepFormer, which integrates the split-and-merge paradigm into a single step
through separator regression with a DETR-style architecture, improving speed
and robustness. SepFormer is a coarse-to-fine approach that predicts table
separators from single-line to line-strip separators with a stack of two
transformer decoders. In the coarse-grained stage, the model learns to
gradually refine single-line segments through decoder layers with additional
angle loss. At the end of the fine-grained stage, the model predicts line-strip
separators by refining sampled points from each single-line segment. Our
SepFormer can run on average at 25.6 FPS while achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR,
PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D histological registration methods struggle with preserving 3D spatial relationships due to issues like tissue deformation and imaging variability, limiting clinical and research utility.

Method: Combines zero-shot deep learning-based keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration techniques.

Result: Effectively handles tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent illumination without retraining.

Conclusion: ZeroReg3D offers a robust solution for 3D histological reconstruction, improving accuracy and generalizability over existing methods.

Abstract: Histological analysis plays a crucial role in understanding tissue structure
and pathology. While recent advancements in registration methods have improved
2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial
relationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research
applications. Specifically, constructing accurate 3D models from 2D slices
remains challenging due to tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts,
variability in imaging techniques, and inconsistent illumination. Deep
learning-based registration methods have demonstrated improved performance but
suffer from limited generalizability and require large-scale training data. In
contrast, non-deep-learning approaches offer better generalizability but often
compromise on accuracy. In this study, we introduced ZeroReg3D, a novel
zero-shot registration pipeline tailored for accurate 3D reconstruction from
serial histological sections. By combining zero-shot deep learning-based
keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration
techniques, ZeroReg3D effectively addresses critical challenges such as tissue
deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent
illumination without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The code has been

TL;DR: SPAZER combines 3D and 2D reasoning for zero-shot 3D visual grounding, outperforming prior methods by 9.0-10.9%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing zero-shot 3DVG methods that focus on either spatial or semantic understanding, SPAZER integrates both for robust performance.

Method: SPAZER uses a progressive framework: 3D scene analysis, anchor-guided candidate screening, and 3D-2D joint decision-making.

Result: SPAZER achieves significant accuracy gains (9.0% and 10.9%) on ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPAZER demonstrates effective zero-shot 3DVG by bridging spatial and semantic reasoning without 3D-labeled training data.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize target objects within a 3D scene
based on natural language queries. To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D
training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the
extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and
VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based)
or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex
real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent
that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first
holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal
viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to
perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore,
leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is
efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging
spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot
grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0%
and 10.9% in accuracy.

Conclusion: The models and database advance AIGODI research, with released resources to support future work.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC) techniques, AI generated images (AIGIs) have attracted widespread
attention, among which AI generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) hold
significant potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. AI generated omnidirectional images exhibit unique quality
issues, however, research on the quality assessment and optimization of
AI-generated omnidirectional images is still lacking. To this end, this work
first studies the quality assessment and distortion-aware saliency prediction
problems for AIGODIs, and further presents a corresponding optimization
process. Specifically, we first establish a comprehensive database to reflect
human feedback for AI-generated omnidirectionals, termed OHF2024, which
includes both subjective quality ratings evaluated from three perspectives and
distortion-aware salient regions. Based on the constructed OHF2024 database, we
propose two models with shared encoders based on the BLIP-2 model to evaluate
the human visual experience and predict distortion-aware saliency for
AI-generated omnidirectional images, which are named as BLIP2OIQA and
BLIP2OISal, respectively. Finally, based on the proposed models, we present an
automatic optimization process that utilizes the predicted visual experience
scores and distortion regions to further enhance the visual quality of an
AI-generated omnidirectional image. Extensive experiments show that our
BLIP2OIQA model and BLIP2OISal model achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
the human visual experience evaluation task and the distortion-aware saliency
prediction task for AI generated omnidirectional images, and can be effectively
used in the optimization process. The database and codes will be released on
https://github.com/IntMeGroup/AIGCOIQA to facilitate future research.

### [140] [SDRNET: Stacked Deep Residual Network for Accurate Semantic Segmentation of Fine-Resolution Remotely Sensed Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21945)
*Naftaly Wambugu,Ruisheng Wang,Bo Guo,Tianshu Yu,Sheng Xu,Mohammed Elhassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDRNet, a stacked deep residual network for semantic segmentation of high-resolution remotely sensed images, addressing challenges like class disparities and object size variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate semantic segmentation of fine-resolution remotely sensed images is hindered by class disparities, occlusion, and object size variation, despite advancements in deep learning.

Method: The proposed SDRNet uses two stacked encoder-decoder networks and dilated residual blocks to capture long-range semantics and preserve spatial details.

Result: Experiments on ISPRS datasets show SDRNet performs competitively against existing deep convolutional neural networks.

Conclusion: SDRNet effectively addresses segmentation challenges in high-resolution imagery, demonstrating robust performance.

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution
remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote
sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed
(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become
available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is
greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key
ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the
extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image
feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS
images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These
challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and
generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning
multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes
from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class
disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly
lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor
segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked
deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The
proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness
long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual
blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient
global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental
results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate
that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in
semantic segmentation.

### [141] [Exploring Semantic Masked Autoencoder for Self-supervised Point Cloud Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21957)
*Yixin Zha,Chuxin Wang,Wenfei Yang,Tianzhu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Masked Autoencoder (SMA) to improve point cloud understanding by addressing the limitations of random masking in self-supervised learning. SMA uses prototype-based semantic modeling and enhanced masking to capture better semantic relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random masking in pre-training methods fails to capture reasonable semantic relationships in point clouds, limiting the performance of self-supervised models.

Method: SMA includes a prototype-based semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy. It also introduces a prompt-tuning strategy for downstream tasks.

Result: Experiments on ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart show SMA's effectiveness in improving feature representations.

Conclusion: SMA outperforms random masking methods by better capturing semantic relationships and enhancing downstream task performance.

Abstract: Point cloud understanding aims to acquire robust and general feature
representations from unlabeled data. Masked point modeling-based methods have
recently shown significant performance across various downstream tasks. These
pre-training methods rely on random masking strategies to establish the
perception of point clouds by restoring corrupted point cloud inputs, which
leads to the failure of capturing reasonable semantic relationships by the
self-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Masked
Autoencoder, which comprises two main components: a prototype-based component
semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy.
Specifically, in the component semantic modeling module, we design a component
semantic guidance mechanism to direct a set of learnable prototypes in
capturing the semantics of different components from objects. Leveraging these
prototypes, we develop a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy that
addresses the limitations of random masking in effectively covering complete
component structures. Furthermore, we introduce a component semantic-enhanced
prompt-tuning strategy, which further leverages these prototypes to improve the
performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
conducted on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

*Meng Yu,Te Cui,Qitong Chu,Wenjie Song,Yi Yang,Yufeng Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TASeg is a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework using LoRA fine-tuning to enhance semantic segmentation by integrating high-level textual information and dynamic feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-T models lack high-level textual information and struggle with similar visual categories. SAM's integration with thermal images and text is hindered by modality heterogeneity and inefficiency.

Method: Proposes TASeg with a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) for merging multi-modal features and CLIP-generated text embeddings for semantic alignment. Uses LoRA fine-tuning to adapt vision foundation models.

Result: Achieves superior performance in challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters, as demonstrated across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: TASeg effectively addresses modality heterogeneity and improves semantic segmentation accuracy by leveraging textual and multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation of open environments is essential for
intelligent systems, yet significant problems remain: 1) Existing RGB-T
semantic segmentation models mainly rely on low-level visual features and lack
high-level textual information, which struggle with accurate segmentation when
categories share similar visual characteristics. 2) While SAM excels in
instance-level segmentation, integrating it with thermal images and text is
hindered by modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency. To address
these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation
models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the
image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual
modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we
incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable
semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and
improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across
diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in
challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

*Biao Wang,Wenwen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces R1-Track, a model fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL using GRPO reinforcement learning for visual tracking, achieving strong performance on GOT-10k while retaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tracking methods lack flexibility and rely on supervised training. The rapid advancement of MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL inspired their application to tracking, despite initial challenges in template matching.

Method: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL using GRPO reinforcement learning on a small dataset with a rule-based reward function, resulting in R1-Track.

Result: R1-Track performed notably on the GOT-10k benchmark, supporting flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions.

Conclusion: R1-Track demonstrates the potential of MLLMs in tracking tasks, with room for further improvements.

Abstract: Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the
scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in
the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching
problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters,
two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress
achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and
regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets,
and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent
years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly.
Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational
capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has
spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However,
experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between
image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned
Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement
learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The
resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k
benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text
descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.
And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough
technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel pipeline for generating long-horizon videos for robotic manipulation tasks, bypassing autoregressive generation by decomposing goals into atomic tasks and using keyframes with interpolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video diffusion models struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks due to error accumulation in autoregressive approaches.

Method: The method involves decomposing goals into atomic tasks, generating keyframes, interpolating between them, and using a semantics-preserving attention module and lightweight policy model.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results in video quality and consistency, outperforming previous models on long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively addresses limitations of autoregressive generation, improving performance in robotic manipulation video generation.

Abstract: We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic
manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant
progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but
struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion
models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot
planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving
one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon,
leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need
for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold
contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic
tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second
diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames,
achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving
attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a
lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated
videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in
video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on
long-horizon tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETP introduces an exponential force scheme for pruning DNNs, outperforming previous methods in compression with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in current pruning techniques, which leave networks dense and cause accuracy drops.

Method: Proposes Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP) using an exponential force application for regularization.

Result: Achieves higher compression rates with negligible accuracy drop across various domains.

Conclusion: ETP is a simple yet effective solution for efficient DNN pruning.

Abstract: The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

### [146] [Advancing Facial Stylization through Semantic Preservation Constraint and Pseudo-Paired Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22022)
*Zhanyi Lu,Yue Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A facial stylization method is proposed to enhance content consistency and stylization by integrating semantic preservation and pseudo-paired supervision, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing StyleGAN-based methods suffer from artifacts or insufficient fidelity due to neglected semantic shifts during stylization.

Method: The approach uses semantic preservation constraints and pseudo-paired supervision, along with multi-level pseudo-paired datasets for supervision.

Result: The method achieves high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style transfer, surpassing previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex designs or extra training.

Abstract: Facial stylization aims to transform facial images into appealing,
high-quality stylized portraits, with the critical challenge of accurately
learning the target style while maintaining content consistency with the
original image. Although previous StyleGAN-based methods have made significant
advancements, the generated results still suffer from artifacts or insufficient
fidelity to the source image. We argue that these issues stem from neglecting
semantic shift of the generator during stylization. Therefore, we propose a
facial stylization method that integrates semantic preservation constraint and
pseudo-paired supervision to enhance the content correspondence and improve the
stylization effect. Additionally, we develop a methodology for creating
multi-level pseudo-paired datasets to implement supervisory constraint.
Furthermore, building upon our facial stylization framework, we achieve more
flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex network
architecture designs or additional training. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach produces high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style
transfer that surpasses previous methods.

*Han Wang,Shengyang Li,Jian Yang,Yuxuan Liu,Yixuan Lv,Zhuang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the HOSS ReID dataset for ship tracking using hybrid optical and SAR sensors, addressing limitations of current methods, and proposes the TransOSS baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ship tracking methods using geostationary or video satellites have limitations like low resolution, weather susceptibility, short filming durations, and limited coverage. The HOSS ReID dataset aims to overcome these by leveraging low-Earth orbit constellations for all-weather tracking.

Method: The paper presents the HOSS ReID dataset with diverse ship images captured under varying conditions. It also proposes TransOSS, a Vision Transformer-based method with refined patch embedding, additional embeddings, and contrastive learning for cross-modal re-identification.

Result: The HOSS ReID dataset enables shorter re-imaging cycles and all-weather tracking. TransOSS demonstrates effectiveness in extracting modality-invariant features for ship re-identification.

Conclusion: The HOSS ReID dataset and TransOSS method provide a robust solution for ship tracking, addressing key challenges in remote sensing and offering public availability for further research.

Abstract: Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains
a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime
ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,
law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking
methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer
low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have
short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable
for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,
we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship
Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical
and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables
all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship
captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different
satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we
propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS,
which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch
embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates
additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs
contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs,
ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features. Our
dataset and baseline method are publicly available on

*Jialei Chen,Xu Zheng,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool,Hiroshi Murase,Daisuke Deguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chimera-Seg improves zero-shot semantic segmentation by combining a segmentation backbone with a CLIP-based semantic head and using Selective Global Distillation to align features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of aligning vision-based features with textual space and bridging the semantic gap between CLIP's global representations and segmentation's local features.

Method: Proposes Chimera-Seg (segmentation backbone + CLIP Semantic Head) and Selective Global Distillation (SGD) for feature alignment.

Result: Achieves improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in hIoU on two benchmarks.

Conclusion: Chimera-Seg effectively combines spatial precision with vision-language alignment, enhancing zero-shot segmentation performance.

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen
classes using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based
methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of
vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such
knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning
vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial
precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between
CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of
segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which
integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head
as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision
with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable
segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features
into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed
projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight
trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with
the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the
mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose
Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense
features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually
reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.
Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense
visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text
encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in
hIoU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIAG is a 3D talking head synthesis framework that enables efficient identity-specific adaptation with minimal training data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reconstruction and rendering-based methods require identity-specific training, which is computationally expensive and lacks scalability.

Method: FIAG uses Global Gaussian Field for shared identity representation and Universal Motion Field for common motion dynamics, enabling rapid adaptation.

Result: FIAG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in comparative and ablation experiments, showing effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: FIAG provides a scalable and efficient solution for talking head synthesis with minimal training data.

Abstract: Reconstruction and rendering-based talking head synthesis methods achieve
high-quality results with strong identity preservation but are limited by their
dependence on identity-specific models. Each new identity requires training
from scratch, incurring high computational costs and reduced scalability
compared to generative model-based approaches. To overcome this limitation, we
propose FIAG, a novel 3D speaking head synthesis framework that enables
efficient identity-specific adaptation using only a few training footage. FIAG
incorporates Global Gaussian Field, which supports the representation of
multiple identities within a shared field, and Universal Motion Field, which
captures the common motion dynamics across diverse identities. Benefiting from
the shared facial structure information encoded in the Global Gaussian Field
and the general motion priors learned in the motion field, our framework
enables rapid adaptation from canonical identity representations to specific
ones with minimal data. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches,
validating both the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Code is available at: \textit{https://github.com/gme-hong/FIAG}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework improves LV measurement accuracy in echocardiography by enforcing straight-line constraints and using AMM images, reducing errors and simplifying user interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual landmark placement for LV measurements in B-mode echocardiography is time-consuming and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks, leading to inaccurate measurements.

Method: The framework trains a landmark detector on AMM images derived from B-mode videos, enforces straight-line constraints, and transforms landmarks back to B-mode space. It includes a semi-automatic human-in-the-loop step for SL placement.

Result: Experiments show improved accuracy over standard B-mode methods, with the framework generalizing well across network architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances LV measurement accuracy, reduces misalignment, and simplifies user interaction while maintaining clinical relevance.

Abstract: Linear measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in the Parasternal Long Axis
(PLAX) view using B-mode echocardiography are crucial for cardiac assessment.
These involve placing 4-6 landmarks along a virtual scanline (SL) perpendicular
to the LV axis near the mitral valve tips. Manual placement is time-consuming
and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks,
causing inaccurate measurements. We propose a novel framework that enhances LV
measurement accuracy by enforcing straight-line constraints. A landmark
detector is trained on Anatomical M-Mode (AMM) images, computed in real time
from B-mode videos, then transformed back to B-mode space. This approach
addresses misalignment and reduces measurement errors. Experiments show
improved accuracy over standard B-mode methods, and the framework generalizes
well across network architectures. Our semi-automatic design includes a
human-in-the-loop step where the user only places the SL, simplifying
interaction while preserving alignment flexibility and clinical relevance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MirrorMe is a real-time, controllable framework for audio-driven portrait animation, using a diffusion transformer (LTX) for efficient latent space denoising. It introduces innovations for identity consistency, audio synchronization, and gesture control, achieving high fidelity and temporal stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods for audio-driven portrait animation suffer from high latency and temporal inconsistency due to frame-by-frame UNet architectures. MirrorMe aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: MirrorMe uses the LTX video model for efficient denoising. It includes: 1) reference identity injection via VAE, 2) a causal audio encoder for synchronization, and 3) progressive training for gesture control.

Result: MirrorMe outperforms existing methods on the EMTD Benchmark in fidelity, lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.

Conclusion: MirrorMe provides a real-time, high-quality solution for audio-driven portrait animation, addressing key challenges in latency and consistency.

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation, which synthesizes realistic videos from
reference images using audio signals, faces significant challenges in real-time
generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations. While recent
diffusion-based methods improve generation quality by integrating audio into
denoising processes, their reliance on frame-by-frame UNet architectures
introduces prohibitive latency and struggles with temporal consistency. This
paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX
video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and
temporally for efficient latent space denoising. To address LTX's trade-offs
between compression and semantic fidelity, we propose three innovations: 1. A
reference identity injection mechanism via VAE-encoded image concatenation and
self-attention, ensuring identity consistency; 2. A causal audio encoder and
adapter tailored to LTX's temporal structure, enabling precise audio-expression
synchronization; and 3. A progressive training strategy combining close-up
facial training, half-body synthesis with facial masking, and hand pose
integration for enhanced gesture control. Extensive experiments on the EMTD
Benchmark demonstrate MirrorMe's state-of-the-art performance in fidelity,
lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for estimating relative pose in rolling shutter cameras using line projections and scanlines, enabling motion-independent pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify rolling shutter camera pose estimation without requiring explicit motion modeling, making it foundational for rolling shutter structure-from-motion (SfM).

Method: Uses intersections of line projections with scanlines, with minimal solvers for generic and specialized cases (e.g., parallel lines, known gravity).

Result: Demonstrated feasibility on the Fastec dataset, showing potential for rolling shutter SfM initialization.

Conclusion: The approach is a promising building block for rolling shutter SfM, with public code release planned.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for estimating the relative pose between rolling
shutter cameras using the intersections of line projections with a single
scanline per image. This allows pose estimation without explicitly modeling
camera motion. Alternatively, scanlines can be selected within a single image,
enabling single-view relative pose estimation for scanlines of rolling shutter
cameras. Our approach is designed as a foundational building block for rolling
shutter structure-from-motion (SfM), where no motion model is required, and
each scanline's pose can be computed independently. % We classify minimal
solvers for this problem in both generic and specialized settings, including
cases with parallel lines and known gravity direction, assuming known
intrinsics and no lens distortion. Furthermore, we develop minimal solvers for
the parallel-lines scenario, both with and without gravity priors, by
leveraging connections between this problem and the estimation of 2D structure
from 1D cameras. % Experiments on rolling shutter images from the Fastec
dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for initializing rolling
shutter SfM, highlighting its potential for further development. % The code
will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel learning paradigm enables machine reasoning in vision tasks by improving performance with increased thinking time, even with limited labeled data. It combines fast and slow-thinking modules inspired by human cognition, outperforming supervised learning and human experts in tasks like cancer localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine intelligence lacks dynamic reasoning abilities, especially in non-verbal domains like visual perception and medical diagnosis. The goal is to bridge this gap by mimicking human reasoning.

Method: The approach integrates a fast-thinking System I module for familiar tasks and a slow-thinking System II module using self-play reinforcement learning to iteratively refine solutions.

Result: The method outperforms large-scale supervised learning, foundation models, and human experts in vision tasks, including cancer localization in medical images.

Conclusion: This paradigm shows transformative potential for non-verbal machine reasoning, addressing critical real-world challenges in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive
decision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine
intelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically
refine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored
reasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such
as mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step
reasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,
spatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,
which remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that
enables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with
increasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where
labelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human
cognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I
module for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that
iteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This
paradigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining
solutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through
extended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning
but also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.
These tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on
medical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for
non-verbal machine reasoning.

### [154] [Towards Accurate Heart Rate Measurement from Ultra-Short Video Clips via Periodicity-Guided rPPG Estimation and Signal Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22078)
*Pei-Kai Huanga,Ya-Ting Chan,Kuan-Wen Chen,Yen-Chun Chou,Shih-Yu Yang,Chiou-Ting Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method for accurate heart rate (HR) estimation from ultra-short 2-second video clips using periodicity-guided rPPG estimation and signal reconstruction to address spectral leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HR measurement methods overlook ultra-short video clips (e.g., 2 seconds), which poses challenges due to limited heartbeat cycles and spectral leakage.

Method: Introduces a periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method and a generator to reconstruct longer rPPG signals from ultra-short clips, ensuring periodic consistency.

Result: Outperforms previous rPPG techniques on four benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art HR measurement accuracy.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses challenges of ultra-short clips, enabling accurate HR estimation and advancing rPPG technology.

Abstract: Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds
but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In
this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video
clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the
limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an
effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent
periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their
much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due
to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer
rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency
to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG
estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only
accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform
previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

*Zipei Ma,Junzhe Jiang,Yurui Chen,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BÃ©zierGS uses learnable BÃ©zier curves for dynamic object motion in street scenes, improving reconstruction and view synthesis without relying on high-precision annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods depend on object pose annotations, limiting large-scale scene reconstruction. BÃ©zierGS aims to overcome this by leveraging temporal data and learnable curves.

Method: BÃ©zierGS models dynamic object trajectories with BÃ©zier curves, uses rendering supervision, and enforces inter-curve consistency for accurate scene separation.

Result: BÃ©zierGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic and static scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis on Waymo and nuPlan datasets.

Conclusion: BÃ©zierGS provides a scalable and annotation-free solution for realistic street scene reconstruction, enhancing autonomous driving simulators.

Abstract: The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing
real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on
object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and
move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision
object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To
address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting
(B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using
learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal
information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling,
automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on
dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve
reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.
Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark
demonstrate that B\'ezierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both
dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

*Hyeongji Kim,Stine Hansen,Michael Kampffmeyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPM improves medical image few-shot segmentation by addressing ADNet's limitations with tied prototypes, multi-class support, and adaptive thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ADNet struggle with background variability, single prototypes, binary classification, and fixed thresholds.

Method: TPM introduces tied prototype locations, probabilistic foundations, multi-class support, and adaptive thresholds.

Result: TPM achieves better segmentation accuracy by handling background variability and extending to multi-class tasks.

Conclusion: TPM offers a novel approach to prototype-based few-shot segmentation for medical images, improving performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods
model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes.
However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising
direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as
an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key
limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary
classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ
variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model
(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for
foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic
foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class
segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.
Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we
leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for
adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM
provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Indian driving pedestrian dataset to improve pedestrian behavior prediction in unstructured environments, highlighting its challenges and outperforming standard datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pedestrian behavior prediction is crucial for autonomous driving safety, especially in complex, unstructured environments.

Method: The authors created a comprehensive dataset with detailed annotations for pedestrian behavior in unstructured Indian driving conditions, evaluating state-of-the-art prediction methods.

Result: The dataset reveals significant performance drops (up to 15%) in intention prediction and underperformance (up to 1208 MSE) in trajectory prediction compared to standard datasets.

Conclusion: The dataset presents new challenges for robust pedestrian behavior modeling and aims to advance research in this field.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting
pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and
unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge
highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured
environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to
enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce
an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of
modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination
changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and
vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed
low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the
ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention
prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to
$\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an
increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.
Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of
intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new
challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust
models. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual pipe modeling from laser scans is time-consuming and labor-intensive, necessitating automation for efficiency.

Method: Estimates skeleton curves, recenters axes with rolling sphere and 2D circle fitting, and refines with 3D smoothing.

Result: Enables accurate determination of pipe properties (radius, length, orientation) and detailed 3D modeling.

Conclusion: Automation reduces costs and speeds up digital twin creation for industrial assets.

Abstract: Accurate digital twins of industrial assets, such as ships and offshore
platforms, rely on the precise reconstruction of complex pipe networks.
However, manual modelling of pipes from laser scan data is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive process. This paper presents a pipeline for automated pipe
reconstruction from incomplete laser scan data. The approach estimates a
skeleton curve using Laplacian-based contraction, followed by curve elongation.
The skeleton axis is then recentred using a rolling sphere technique combined
with 2D circle fitting, and refined with a 3D smoothing step. This enables the
determination of pipe properties, including radius, length and orientation, and
facilitates the creation of detailed 3D models of complex pipe networks. By
automating pipe reconstruction, this approach supports the development of
digital twins, allowing for rapid and accurate modeling while reducing costs.

*Zhengyun Cheng,Changhao Wang,Guanwen Zhang,Yi Xu,Wei Zhou,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CP-INR, a CP-based low-rank tensor function for implicit neural representation, addressing challenges in sparse CP decomposition and introducing smoothness regularization for continuous data tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor decomposition methods like Tucker and CP lack a balance between flexibility and interpretability, and sparse CP solutions are hard to achieve.

Method: The authors propose CP-INR, leveraging CP decomposition with neural networks, variational Schatten-p quasi-norm for sparsity, and spectral norm-based regularization for smoothness.

Result: CP-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in tasks like image inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling.

Conclusion: CP-INR offers a versatile, theoretically grounded solution for multi-dimensional data recovery, combining interpretability, sparsity, and smoothness.

Abstract: Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data,
such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become
essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like
Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In
contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more
natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains
challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a
CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit
neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data
representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of
tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a
sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p
quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For
smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the
Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness
regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can
serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image
denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive
experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image
inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority
and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Frame is a novel adaptive frame selection method for Video-LLMs, improving video comprehension by focusing on query-relevant frames without exceeding computational limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video-LLMs struggle with capturing crucial spatiotemporal clues due to uniform frame sampling, limiting their effectiveness in video understanding tasks.

Method: Q-Frame uses a training-free, plug-and-play strategy with a text-image matching network (e.g., CLIP) and the Gumbel-Max trick for adaptive frame selection and multi-resolution scaling.

Result: Q-Frame outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets (MLVU, LongVideoBench, Video-MME) by preserving critical temporal and spatial information.

Conclusion: Q-Frame enhances Video-LLMs' video comprehension capabilities, offering a scalable and efficient solution for diverse video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting
these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and
temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often
struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos
effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive
frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content
and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy
generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max
trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more
frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical
temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness
through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing
methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the binding problem in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by augmenting visual inputs with spatial structures and textual prompts, improving performance in visual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with the binding problem, leading to errors in tasks like counting and spatial reasoning. Current models lack spatially grounded, serial attention mechanisms.

Method: Introduces low-level spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) paired with textual prompts to encourage sequential, spatially-aware parsing.

Result: Improves GPT-4o's visual search accuracy by 25.00%, counting accuracy by 26.83%, and spatial relationship tasks by 9.50%. Visual modifications are essential; textual strategies alone fail.

Conclusion: Low-level visual structuring is a powerful, underexplored method for enhancing VLMs' compositional visual reasoning, outperforming purely linguistic approaches.

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual
reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to
reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents.
This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual
search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor
is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking
mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a
simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level
spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual
prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically
demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by
25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in
scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship
tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the
visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,
including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade
performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,
underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely
linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual
structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving
compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for
enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

*Ronald Fecso,JosÃ© Morano,Ursula Schmidt-Erfurth,Hrvoje BogunoviÄ*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetFiner is an SSL vision-language refinement scheme that enhances existing foundation models for OCT imaging, improving downstream performance without costly supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models for OCT lack robust semantic understanding, requiring supervised fine-tuning, which may not be feasible. RetFiner addresses this by leveraging textual data for better adaptation.

Method: RetFiner uses a diverse set of training objectives to refine foundation models by incorporating rich supervisory signals from textual data.

Result: RetFiner significantly improves linear probing performance on seven OCT classification tasks, with average increases of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1 percentage points over baselines for RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM, respectively.

Conclusion: RetFiner effectively enhances existing foundation models for OCT, enabling efficient adaptation to specific populations and tasks without supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: The rise of imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled clinicians and researchers to
streamline retinal disease staging. A popular DL approach is self-supervised
learning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,
avoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation
models (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.
However, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a
comprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by
their downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require
supervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific
applications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL
vision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing
FMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations
for improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training
objectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual
data. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM,
showing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly
diverse OCT classification tasks, with an average increase of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1
percentage points over their baselines, respectively. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at https://github.com/ronnief1/RetFiner.

### [163] [Attention-disentangled Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space Optimization for Few-shot Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22161)
*Taijin Zhao,Heqian Qiu,Yu Dai,Lanxiao Wang,Fanman Meng,Qingbo Wu,Hongliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) framework for few-shot object detection (FSOD), addressing limitations of entangled feature spaces by decoupling objectness and classification. It introduces Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) and a Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSOD approaches entangle objectness and classification in shared feature spaces, leading to class-specific objectness criteria and poor generalization to novel classes.

Method: The UOFS framework decouples feature space into orthogonal components (magnitude for objectness, angle for classification). HBO strategy removes unlabeled instances for unbiased supervision and incorporates unlabeled foregrounds for uniform angular optimization. SADA module resolves task conflicts.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms existing entangled feature space approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed UOFS framework, HBO, and SADA module effectively address FSOD challenges, improving performance for novel classes.

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples
for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing
FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle
objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature
spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria
and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this
limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization
framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal
components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes
classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness
knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the
disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set
images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between
potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization
depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of
angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose
a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure
background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to
provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating
unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular
optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a
Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address
task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based
on entangled feature spaces.

TL;DR: The paper proposes FS-VAE, a model for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, enhancing semantic learning with frequency decomposition and multilevel alignment to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in previous approaches that overlook fine-grained action patterns in semantic space, hindering accurate zero-shot recognition.

Method: Introduces FS-VAE with frequency-based enhancement, semantic-based action description, and calibrated cross-alignment loss to bridge semantic gaps.

Result: Benchmark evaluations show FS-VAE effectively differentiates similar action clusters, improving zero-shot recognition.

Conclusion: FS-VAE's frequency-enhanced semantic features and alignment strategies enhance robustness in zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition.

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of
identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous
approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action
recognition.

TL;DR: A novel two-stage multi-view 2D/3D registration method improves accuracy and robustness by leveraging cross-view constraints and test-time optimization, achieving superior performance on the DeepFluoro dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate alignment of preoperative models with intraoperative images is critical for interventional navigation, but limited field of view in single-image scenarios necessitates multi-view approaches.

Method: The method involves two stages: (1) a combined loss function with pose and image dissimilarity terms, including cross-view constraints, and (2) test-time optimization to refine poses.

Result: Achieves a mean target registration error (mTRE) of 0.79 Â± 2.17 mm on the DeepFluoro dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances registration robustness and accuracy, making it suitable for clinical applications.

Abstract: Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns preoperative models with
intraoperative images of the same anatomy, is crucial for successful
interventional navigation. To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view
in single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is
required by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two
stages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating
both the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the
dissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and
observed intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view
training loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly
enforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is
performed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method
exploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the
robustness of the registration process. The proposed framework achieves a mean
target registration error (mTRE) of $0.79 \pm 2.17$ mm on six specimens from
the DeepFluoro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of varying low-light conditions and subjective enhancement preferences.

Method: Integrates deep reinforcement learning in the Fourier domain, uses zero-reference image evaluation for training, and personalized adaptive iterative strategy for inference.

Result: Superior perceptual quality and adaptability in personalized enhancement, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: ReF-LLE effectively handles diverse low-light conditions and user preferences, achieving high-quality personalized enhancements.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement presents two primary challenges: 1) Significant
variations in low-light images across different conditions, and 2) Enhancement
levels influenced by subjective preferences and user intent. To address these
issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement
method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep
reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement
learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation
strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that
guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively.
In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative
strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which
represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to
adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution
of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and
adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.

TL;DR: Quantum gate perturbations, often seen as harmful, can enhance machine learning by acting as data augmentation. The paper explores Bloch sphere rotations for quantum-inspired augmentation, showing improved image classification performance on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether small quantum gate perturbations, typically considered detrimental, can benefit machine learning by serving as data augmentation and whether they can be simulated classically.

Method: The study uses random Bloch sphere rotations (SU(2) transformations) as a quantum-inspired augmentation technique, applied to classical data like ImageNet, and evaluates performance metrics.

Result: Quantum-inspired augmentation improved Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5 accuracy by 2.5%, and F1 score from 8% to 12% compared to classical methods. Stronger unitary augmentations, while preserving information, did not enhance privacy.

Conclusion: Small-angle Bloch rotations effectively enhance classical machine learning performance, but stronger unitary transformations do not improve differential privacy.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are
common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial
for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these
perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they
can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data
augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on
classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical
machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere
rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet
effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional
augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations
lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like
image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation
methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to
classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch
rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet
dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves
image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5
accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard
classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary
augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in
principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential
applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation
approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy
and discuss the implications of this limitation.

Motivation: Existing methods suffer from incomplete inputs causing dispersed action distributions, hindering pretraining efficiency.

Method: 4D-VLA uses sequential RGB-D inputs to align coordinate systems and introduces memory bank sampling for informative frame extraction.

Result: The model outperforms OpenVLA in success rates and excels in spatial perception on MV-Bench.

Conclusion: 4D-VLA enhances spatiotemporal reasoning and adaptability, proving superior to existing methods.

Abstract: Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge.
Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple
observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting
in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as
coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly
hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel
approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate
these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information
into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate
systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong
spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead.
Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy
designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further
improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model
performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a
significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial
perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a
multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing
methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.

*Yu-Cheng Lin,Yu-Syuan Xu,Hao-Wei Chen,Hsien-Kai Kuo,Chun-Yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EAMamba improves Vision Mamba for image restoration by introducing MHSSM and all-around scanning, reducing FLOPs by 31-89% without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba excels in long-range dependencies but struggles with computational complexity and local pixel forgetting in low-level vision tasks.

Method: Introduces EAMamba with MHSSM for efficient multi-sequence scanning and an all-around strategy to address local pixel forgetting.

Result: Achieves 31-89% FLOPs reduction while maintaining performance in tasks like super resolution, denoising, deblurring, and dehazing.

Conclusion: EAMamba effectively addresses Vision Mamba's limitations, offering a computationally efficient solution for image restoration.

Abstract: Image restoration is a key task in low-level computer vision that aims to
reconstruct high-quality images from degraded inputs. The emergence of Vision
Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks
a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence
in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage
for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters
challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that
scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To
address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba
(EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan
Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently
aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational
complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements
multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel
forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations
across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising,
deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a
significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance
compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.

*Filippo Merlo,Ece Takmaz,Wenkai Chen,Albert Gatt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) use scene context for object reference, introducing the COOCO dataset to test scene-object congruency and noise effects. Findings show adaptive reliance on context, balancing local and contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if VLMs learn to rely on scene contexts for object recognition and reference, similar to humans.

Method: Introduces the COOCO dataset to test VLMs under varying scene-object congruency and noise levels, analyzing attention mechanisms.

Result: VLMs adaptively use scene context, relying more under high congruency or object degradation. Attention shifts to targets in mid-layers under moderate noise.

Conclusion: VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for object reference, with context reliance varying by congruency and noise.

Abstract: Natural scenes provide us with rich contexts for object recognition and
reference. In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at
generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial
configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on
scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To
address this question, we introduce the \textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context
(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to
objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different
perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,
depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the
level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high
target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis
reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the
target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that
VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference
generation. We make our dataset, code and models available at

### [171] [Rethinking Visual Token Reduction in LVLMs under Cross-modal Misalignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22283)
*Rui Xu,Yunke Wang,Yong Luo,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionDrop is a training-free, visual-only pruning framework for LVLMs that selects informative visual tokens using intra-modal attention, improving efficiency without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs face computational overhead due to excessive visual tokens, and text-conditioned reduction methods suffer from cross-modal misalignment.

Method: VisionDrop uses intra-modal attention for token selection and progressive pruning across the visual encoder and LLM hierarchy.

Result: VisionDrop outperforms existing methods in benchmarks, maintaining performance under aggressive token budgets.

Conclusion: VisionDrop offers a simple, effective solution for efficient LVLM inference without additional training.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences
of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens
often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to
substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in
practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to
or within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction
approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that
textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this
work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms
of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of
text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a
training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual
tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on
textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,
we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a
progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and
lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual
information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive
experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent
improvements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or
complex modifications. Its simple yet effective design enables efficient
inference while preserving strong performance across tasks.

*Mengqi Zhou,Xipeng Wang,Yuxi Wang,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoomCraft is a multi-stage pipeline for generating 3D indoor scenes from user inputs (images, sketches, text) using constraint-driven optimization and a heuristic-based algorithm to ensure layout coherence and minimize collisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D indoor scene generation face challenges like repetitive elements, object collisions, and incomplete layouts due to limited global spatial reasoning or multi-constraint struggles.

Method: RoomCraft combines a scene generation pipeline with constraint-driven optimization, using a spatial relationship network, heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS), and a Conflict-Aware Positioning Strategy (CAPS) to handle multi-constraint scenarios.

Result: RoomCraft outperforms existing methods in generating realistic, coherent, and visually appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Conclusion: RoomCraft addresses key limitations in 3D indoor scene generation, offering a robust solution for diverse user inputs while ensuring layout completeness and realism.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms
existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually
appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OutDreamer, a DiT-based framework, improves video outpainting with efficient control and conditional branches, mask-driven attention, and latent alignment loss, outperforming state-of-the-art zero-shot methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using latent diffusion models struggle with quality and adaptability in video outpainting, prompting the exploration of diffusion transformers (DiTs).

Method: OutDreamer uses two branches: an efficient video control branch for masked video extraction and a conditional outpainting branch for content generation. It includes mask-driven self-attention and latent alignment loss for consistency.

Result: OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods on benchmarks, demonstrating superior adaptability and quality.

Conclusion: The DiT-based OutDreamer framework effectively addresses video outpainting challenges, offering high-quality, adaptable, and temporally consistent results.

Abstract: Video outpainting is a challenging task that generates new video content by
extending beyond the boundaries of an original input video, requiring both
temporal and spatial consistency. Many state-of-the-art methods utilize latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones but still struggle to achieve high
quality and adaptability in generated content. Diffusion transformers (DiTs)
have emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance.
We introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two
main components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional
outpainting branch. The efficient video control branch effectively extracts
masked video information, while the conditional outpainting branch generates
missing content based on these extracted conditions. Additionally, we propose a
mask-driven self-attention layer that dynamically integrates the given mask
information, further enhancing the model's adaptability to outpainting tasks.
Furthermore, we introduce a latent alignment loss to maintain overall
consistency both within and between frames. For long video outpainting, we
employ a cross-video-clip refiner to iteratively generate missing content,
ensuring temporal consistency across video clips. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our zero-shot OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods on widely recognized benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for improving visual localization by augmenting feature descriptors and translating them to a latent space, addressing challenges in cross-feature detector scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail in cross-feature detector cases due to low keypoint repeatability and non-discriminatory descriptors, limiting practical use.

Method: Augments feature descriptors for cross-detector matching and translates them to a latent space.

Result: Significantly improves image matching and visual localization in cross-feature scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses cross-feature detector challenges, enhancing performance in visual localization.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods fail to solve visual localization in scenarios where
different devices use different sparse feature extraction algorithms to obtain
keypoints and their corresponding descriptors. Translating feature descriptors
is enough to enable matching. However, performance is drastically reduced in
cross-feature detector cases, because current solutions assume common
keypoints. This means that the same detector has to be used, which is rarely
the case in practice when different descriptors are used. The low repeatability
of keypoints, in addition to non-discriminatory and non-distinctive
descriptors, make the identification of true correspondences extremely
challenging. We present the first method tackling this problem, which performs
feature descriptor augmentation targeting cross-detector feature matching, and
then feature translation to a latent space. We show that our method
significantly improves image matching and visual localization in the
cross-feature scenario and evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks.

TL;DR: A multimodal deep learning framework using single-date SAR imagery and geospatial data for rapid building damage detection post-disaster, tested on the 2023 Turkey earthquake.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quick building damage identification is vital for disaster response, but optical imagery is often limited by clouds or lack of pre-event data.

Method: Integrates SAR imagery, OSM footprints, DSM data, and GEM attributes for damage detection without pre-event data.

Result: Geospatial features improve accuracy and generalizability, demonstrated on Turkey's earthquake dataset.

Conclusion: The framework offers reliable, rapid damage assessment, scalable for diverse disaster regions, aiding disaster management.

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for
guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite
imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often
hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework
for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)
COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.
Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building
footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure
attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy
and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre
and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating
rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is
demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering
multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that
incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance
and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with
detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable
and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available
pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process
ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,
underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and
recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the
paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle unstable error correction and performance degradation in fuzzy vault-based BCS due to variable feature sizes and feature type transformations.

Method: Introduces a novel feature quantization method using equal frequent intervals to ensure fixed feature set sizes and training-free adaptation.

Result: Significantly reduces performance gaps and integrates well with existing systems, with minimal degradation in face, fingerprint, and iris recognition.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses performance issues across major biometric modalities.

Abstract: This paper analyses and addresses the performance gap in the fuzzy
vault-based \ac{BCS}. We identify unstable error correction capabilities, which
are caused by variable feature set sizes and their influence on similarity
thresholds, as a key source of performance degradation. This issue is further
compounded by information loss introduced through feature type transformations.
To address both problems, we propose a novel feature quantization method based
on \it{equal frequent intervals}. This method guarantees fixed feature set
sizes and supports training-free adaptation to any number of intervals. The
proposed approach significantly reduces the performance gap introduced by
template protection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing
systems to minimize the negative effects of feature transformation. Experiments
on state-of-the-art face, fingerprint, and iris recognition systems confirm
that only minimal performance degradation remains, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the method across major biometric modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the performance of CNN (ResNet34) and Vision Transformer (ViT B16) architectures for event-based cameras, which are crucial for dynamic environments like UAVs and autonomous vehicles.

Method: Fine-tuned ResNet34 and ViT B16 on the GEN1 event-based dataset, evaluating performance under standard and noisy conditions.

Result: ResNet34 achieved 88% accuracy, slightly outperforming ViT B16 (86%), but ViT B16 showed better robustness, especially with limited pre-training data.

Conclusion: ResNet34 is marginally more accurate, but ViT B16's robustness makes it promising for dynamic environments, with potential applications in UAV and aviation tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer
vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision
Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes,
unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are
particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous
vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT
B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and
compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of
simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that
ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with
ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the
ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its
pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based
vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise
for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and
event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of OOD detection in 3D point clouds, especially for safe and robust perception, where existing 2D methods fall short.

Result: GSP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework is effective, adaptable to few-shot scenarios, and practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in 3D point cloud data remains a

introduces a training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) for effective OOD detection in 3D point clouds. By constructing a graph
based on class prototypes and testing data, we exploit the data manifold
structure to enhancing the effectiveness of VLMs for 3D OOD detection. We
propose a novel Graph Score Propagation (GSP) method that incorporates prompt
clustering and self-training negative prompting to improve OOD scoring with

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a task for improving abstract reasoning in Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) by updating interpretations with new evidence. It proposes frameworks for classification and generation tasks, along with a benchmark dataset and evaluation metric, showing significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMMs struggle with adaptive reasoning, needing to revise interpretations as new context emerges. DVidE addresses this by challenging models to update reasoning dynamically.

Method: For classification, the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework uses counterfactual reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement. For generation, ASR output is combined with an LLM to produce coherent updates.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

Conclusion: The proposed DVidE task and frameworks enhance VLMMs' ability to adapt reasoning with evolving evidence, validated by a new benchmark and metric.

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in
understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive
reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information
emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context
can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce
Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think
like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.
In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine
whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification
version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment
relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we
propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual
reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce
inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines
ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually
relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.
Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with
strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric
specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method
in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

TL;DR: A test-time consistency framework improves semantic consistency in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without supervised re-training, using cross-entropy agreement and pseudo-label consistency losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs exhibit inconsistent behavior with semantically equivalent inputs, reducing reliability despite high average accuracy.

Method: Proposes a post-hoc, model-agnostic framework with two objectives: Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss and Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss, applied at test time.

Result: Substantial gains in consistency on the MM-R3 benchmark, enhancing reliability without re-training.

Conclusion: The framework offers a simple, effective, and plug-and-play solution for improving VLM consistency at inference time.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior
when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability
and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even
state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically
equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work
addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale
fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective
test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without
supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and
applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we
enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a
Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across
semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that
draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and
leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.
Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial
gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new
direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.

*Yuhao Liu,Tengfei Wang,Fang Liu,Zhenwei Wang,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shape-for-Motion introduces a 3D proxy-based framework for precise and consistent video editing, enabling user edits on a single frame to propagate across the entire video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with fine-grained alignment of user intentions in video editing, necessitating a more precise and controllable solution.

Method: The framework converts target objects into time-consistent 3D meshes, uses a Dual-Propagation Strategy for edit propagation, and employs a decoupled video diffusion model for rendering.

Result: Supports diverse manipulations (pose, rotation, scaling, texture, etc.) with high consistency and quality.

Conclusion: Shape-for-Motion advances controllable video editing, demonstrating superior performance in experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented
opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users
often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with
precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing
methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open
and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel
framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video
editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the
input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be
performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To
simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that
allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits
are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D
meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce
the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a
decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework
supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the
video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture
modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward
high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a simple, inexpensive, and general-purpose method for uncertainty quantification in radiance fields without requiring training.

Method: Uses backward warping to project reliable renderings to unseen viewpoints and measures consistency with rendered images there.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks like active view selection and mapping.

Conclusion: WarpRF is effective, versatile, and superior to specialized frameworks for uncertainty quantification in radiance fields.

Abstract: We introduce WarpRF, a training-free general-purpose framework for
quantifying the uncertainty of radiance fields. Built upon the assumption that
photometric and geometric consistency should hold among images rendered by an
accurate model, WarpRF quantifies its underlying uncertainty from an unseen
point of view by leveraging backward warping across viewpoints, projecting
reliable renderings to the unseen viewpoint and measuring the consistency with
images rendered there. WarpRF is simple and inexpensive, does not require any

Method: The approach constructs image triplets (two augmented views of the same image and a distinct image) and trains the model to generate reasoning processes for comparison. Rule-based reinforcement learning optimizes the model.

Result: The method generalizes well to various questions, achieving significant improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and strong performance on general vision tasks.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning and rule-based reinforcement learning enable effective CoT reasoning without human-annotated data, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: This work explores enabling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to link visual
cues across multiple images. A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based
reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods
typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be
particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and
complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation
learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as
supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two
augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.
During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to
compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the
model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity
and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual
changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that,
although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning
ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying
on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant
improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance
on general vision tasks.

*Sai Sri Teja,Sreevidya Chintalapati,Vinayak Gupta,Mukund Varma T,Haejoon Lee,Aswin Sankaranarayanan,Kaushik Mitra*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PhotonSplat is a framework for 3D scene reconstruction from SPAD binary images, addressing noise and blur trade-offs, with applications in segmentation and dynamic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering techniques fail with motion-blurred imagery. SPAD arrays offer high-speed sensing but introduce binary image challenges.

Method: Introduces PhotonSplat, using 3D spatial filtering and supporting no-reference/reference-based colorization. Extends to dynamic scenes.

Result: Effective 3D reconstruction from SPAD binary images, demonstrated on the PhotonScenes dataset.

Conclusion: PhotonSplat advances neural rendering for motion-blurred scenes, enabling downstream tasks and dynamic scene handling.

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction using neural rendering have enabled
high-quality 3D capture. However, they often fail when the input imagery is
corrupted by motion blur, due to fast motion of the camera or the objects in
the scene. This work advances neural rendering techniques in such scenarios by
using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays, an emerging sensing
technology capable of sensing images at extremely high speeds. However, the use
of SPADs presents its own set of unique challenges in the form of binary
images, that are driven by stochastic photon arrivals. To address this, we
introduce PhotonSplat, a framework designed to reconstruct 3D scenes directly
from SPAD binary images, effectively navigating the noise vs. blur trade-off.
Our approach incorporates a novel 3D spatial filtering technique to reduce
noise in the renderings. The framework also supports both no-reference using
generative priors and reference-based colorization from a single blurry image,
enabling downstream applications such as segmentation, object detection and
appearance editing tasks. Additionally, we extend our method to incorporate
dynamic scene representations, making it suitable for scenes with moving
objects. We further contribute PhotonScenes, a real-world multi-view dataset
captured with the SPAD sensors.

attention, and physics-informed models. This paper presents an overview of the
Challenge design, summarises the key characteristics of the dataset, provides a
concise literature review, introduces the technical details of the underlying
methodology working with tracked freehand ultrasound data, and offers a
comparative analysis of submitted methods across multiple evaluation metrics.
The results highlight both the progress and current limitations of
state-of-the-art approaches in this domain, and inform directions for future
research. The data, evaluation code, and baseline are publicly available to
facilitate ongoing development and reproducibility. As a live and evolving

*Yuansheng Li,Yunhao Zou,Linwei Chen,Ying Fu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel pipeline for Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) reconstruction, addressing dataset scarcity and degradation challenges with a physics-based model and a transformer-based method (IHRUT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHI's potential is limited by complex errors and lack of training data, hindering performance.

Method: Develops a simplified IHI degradation model for dataset synthesis and introduces IHRUT, a transformer-based architecture for spectral correction and detail restoration.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance and generalization in IHI reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively bridges the gap between IHI and deep learning, enhancing reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) is a critical technique for
large-scale remote sensing tasks due to its advantages in flux and spectral
resolution. However, IHI is susceptible to complex errors arising from imaging
steps, and its quality is limited by existing signal processing-based
reconstruction algorithms. Two key challenges hinder performance enhancement:
1) the lack of training datasets. 2) the difficulty in eliminating IHI-specific
degradation components through learning-based methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel IHI reconstruction pipeline. First, based on
imaging physics and radiometric calibration data, we establish a simplified yet
accurate IHI degradation model and a parameter estimation method. This model
enables the synthesis of realistic IHI training datasets from hyperspectral
images (HSIs), bridging the gap between IHI reconstruction and deep learning.
Second, we design the Interferometric Hyperspectral Reconstruction Unfolding
Transformer (IHRUT), which achieves effective spectral correction and detail
restoration through a stripe-pattern enhancement mechanism and a
spatial-spectral transformer architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance and generalization capability of our method.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UnMix-NeRF integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF for hyperspectral view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NeRF-based segmentation lacks material properties, limiting applications like robotics and AR. UnMix-NeRF addresses this gap.

Method: Models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, using learned global endmembers and per-point abundances for material segmentation.

Result: Superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation compared to existing methods, with scene editing capabilities.

Conclusion: UnMix-NeRF effectively bridges the gap in material perception for NeRF-based methods, offering practical applications in various fields.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object
semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties.
This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for
robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce
UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling
joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material
segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular
components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure
material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For
material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned
endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF
enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible
material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our
approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material
segmentation to existing methods. Project page:

### [190] [StableCodec: Taming One-Step Diffusion for Extreme Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21977)
*Tianyu Zhang,Xin Luo,Li Li,Dong Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: StableCodec introduces one-step diffusion for ultra-low bitrate image compression, improving realism and fidelity with efficient coding and dual-branch structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based compression methods require many denoising steps and sacrifice fidelity, limiting real-time use.

Method: Uses a Deep Compression Latent Codec for noisy latent transmission and a Dual-Branch Coding Structure for fidelity. End-to-end optimization with bitrate and pixel constraints.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on FID, KID, and DISTS metrics at bitrates as low as 0.005 bpp, with fast inference.

Conclusion: StableCodec achieves high-fidelity, high-realism compression at ultra-low bitrates efficiently, suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has shown remarkable potential for
achieving ultra-low bitrate coding (less than 0.05 bits per pixel) with high
realism, by leveraging the generative priors of large pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, current approaches require a large number of
denoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme
bitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression
scenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity,
as diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To
address these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step
diffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with
improved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an
efficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent
representation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a
Dual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and
decoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we adopt end-to-end
optimization with joint bitrate and pixel-level constraints. Extensive
experiments on the CLIC 2020, DIV2K, and Kodak dataset demonstrate that
StableCodec outperforms existing methods in terms of FID, KID and DISTS by a
significant margin, even at bitrates as low as 0.005 bits per pixel, while
maintaining strong fidelity. Additionally, StableCodec achieves inference
speeds comparable to mainstream transform coding schemes. All source code are

*Qi Gao,Zhihao Chen,Dong Zeng,Junping Zhang,Jianhua Ma,Hongming Shan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes NEED, a noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable low-dose CT reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generalizing deep learning models to unseen low-dose CT data, avoiding unrealistic structures from traditional diffusion models.

Method: Uses a shifted Poisson diffusion model for projection data and a doubly guided diffusion model for image refinement, requiring only normal-dose training data.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in reconstruction and generalization across various dose levels.

Conclusion: NEED offers a robust, generalizable solution for low-dose CT reconstruction with superior performance.

Abstract: The generalization of deep learning-based low-dose computed tomography (CT)
reconstruction models to doses unseen in the training data is important and
remains challenging. Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve
the generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse
CT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion
models have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)
reconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT
image noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior
information from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a
noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed
NEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.
First, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection
data, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT
projections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine
reconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions
to more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction
fidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain
reconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be
effectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time
step matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and
segmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and
generalization performance. Source code is made available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for WMH segmentation and localization using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs, showing multimodal fusion improves accuracy but joint lesion-region segmentation is less effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate WMH segmentation and localization are crucial for diagnosing small vessel disease and neurodegeneration, but existing methods lack flexibility with missing modalities and anatomical integration.

Method: Proposes a deep learning framework for WMH segmentation in native space, evaluating four input configurations (FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR-T1, modality-interchangeable) and a multi-task model for joint lesion and anatomical region prediction.

Result: Multimodal input improves segmentation performance; modality-interchangeable setup trades accuracy for robustness. Joint lesion-region segmentation was less effective than separate models.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion enhances WMH analysis, but joint modeling may face representational conflicts.

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are radiological markers of small vessel
disease and neurodegeneration, whose accurate segmentation and spatial
localization are crucial for diagnosis and monitoring. While multimodal MRI
offers complementary contrasts for detecting and contextualizing WM lesions,
existing approaches often lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and
fail to integrate anatomical localization efficiently. We propose a deep
learning framework for WM lesion segmentation and localization that operates
directly in native space using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs. Our study
evaluates four input configurations: FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR
and T1, and a modality-interchangeable setup. It further introduces a
multi-task model for jointly predicting lesion and anatomical region masks to
estimate region-wise lesion burden. Experiments conducted on the MICCAI WMH
Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that multimodal input significantly
improves the segmentation performance, outperforming unimodal models. While the
modality-interchangeable setting trades accuracy for robustness, it enables
inference in cases with missing modalities. Joint lesion-region segmentation
using multi-task learning was less effective than separate models, suggesting
representational conflict between tasks. Our findings highlight the utility of
multimodal fusion for accurate and robust WMH analysis, and the potential of
joint modeling for integrated predictions.

Abstract: Purpose: Aortic dissections are life-threatening cardiovascular conditions
requiring accurate segmentation of true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false
lumen thrombosis (FLT) from CTA images for effective management. Manual
segmentation is time-consuming and variable, necessitating automated solutions.
Materials and Methods: We developed four deep learning-based pipelines for Type
B aortic dissection segmentation: a single-step model, a sequential model, a
sequential multi-task model, and an ensemble model, utilizing 3D U-Net and
Swin-UnetR architectures. A dataset of 100 retrospective CTA images was split
into training (n=80), validation (n=10), and testing (n=10). Performance was
assessed using the Dice Coefficient and Hausdorff Distance. Results: Our
approach achieved superior segmentation accuracy, with Dice Coefficients of
0.91 $\pm$ 0.07 for TL, 0.88 $\pm$ 0.18 for FL, and 0.47 $\pm$ 0.25 for FLT,
outperforming Yao et al. (1), who reported 0.78 $\pm$ 0.20, 0.68 $\pm$ 0.18,

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a three-step pipeline for CVD classification from CT images, focusing on interpretability and outperforming raw CT-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for CVD classification lack clinical interpretability, prompting a need for a more transparent approach.

Method: The pipeline includes image segmentation, image registration, and downstream classification using radiomic and geometric features.

Result: The method achieves 87.50% accuracy on the ASOCA dataset, surpassing raw CT-based models (67.50%).

Conclusion: The proposed interpretable pipeline improves CVD classification accuracy and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Automatic detection and classification of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) from
Computed Tomography (CT) images play an important part in facilitating
better-informed clinical decisions. However, most of the recent deep learning
based methods either directly work on raw CT data or utilize it in pair with
anatomical cardiac structure segmentation by training an end-to-end classifier.
As such, these approaches become much more difficult to interpret from a
clinical perspective. To address this challenge, in this work, we break down
the CVD classification pipeline into three components: (i) image segmentation,
(ii) image registration, and (iii) downstream CVD classification. Specifically,
we utilize the Atlas-ISTN framework and recent segmentation foundational models
to generate anatomical structure segmentation and a normative healthy atlas.
These are further utilized to extract clinically interpretable radiomic
features as well as deformation field based geometric features (through atlas
registration) for CVD classification. Our experiments on the publicly available
ASOCA dataset show that utilizing these features leads to better CVD
classification accuracy (87.50\%) when compared against classification model
trained directly on raw CT images (67.50\%). Our code is publicly available:

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deformation-informed 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) method for dynamic CBCT reconstruction, addressing motion artifacts and computational inefficiencies in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion artifacts in 3D CBCT due to breathing variability are a challenge. Current methods like phase sorting or implicit motion representations are either limited or computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis function and a deformation-informed framework to ensure consistency in Gaussian motion, coupling temporal evolution of Gaussian properties under a unified deformation field.

Result: Evaluated on six CBCT datasets, the method achieves superior image quality with a 6x speedup over HexPlane.

Conclusion: The deformation-informed 4DGS framework offers efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction, with potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: 3D Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in radiotherapy but suffers from motion
artifacts due to breathing. A common clinical approach mitigates this by
sorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per
phase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT
instead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion
without phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)
offer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to
dynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane,
use implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While
explicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial
regularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these
limitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis
function and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by
coupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and
rotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six
CBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over
HexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS
for efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at

*Anirban Ray,Ashesh,Florian Jug*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HazeMatching is a novel iterative method for dehazing microscopy images, balancing fidelity and realism without needing an explicit degradation operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cheaper microscopy modalities like widefield produce hazy images. Existing dehazing methods prioritize either fidelity or realism, but not both.

Method: Adapts conditional flow matching framework, guiding the generative process with hazy observations in the conditional velocity field.

Result: Achieves a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on 5 datasets, outperforming 7 baselines. Produces well-calibrated predictions.

Conclusion: HazeMatching effectively balances fidelity and realism, is applicable to real microscopy data, and will be publicly available.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life
sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering
out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as
widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.
Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to
cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off
tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high
PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.
Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or
produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In
this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light
microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to
find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the
realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the
conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a
hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on
5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion
and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a
consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with
calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated
predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation
operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All
data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available
under a permissive license.

*Xiang Dai,Kyrollos Yanny,Kristina Monakhova,Nicholas Antipa*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A single-shot HDR imaging method using GRR shutter mode and optical shuffling to recover HDR data, outperforming others in high saturation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome motion artifacts in classic multi-exposure HDR imaging and limitations of prior single-shot methods with extended highlight regions.

Method: Utilizes GRR shutter mode for varied exposure times and optical shuffling to randomize exposures, solving an optimization problem with a total variation prior.

Result: Outperforms other single-shot methods in high saturation (10%+) and is competitive at 1% saturation; prototype achieves 73dB dynamic range with an 8-bit sensor.

Conclusion: The method effectively recovers HDR data in challenging conditions, demonstrated by a practical prototype.

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the
dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple
exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging
dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR
data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many
established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image
detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize
the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR
shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the
sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the
sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.
The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization
problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we
demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many
sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest
saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an
off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle
is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our
prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with
48dB dynamic range.

*Nicolas Bougie,Narimasa Watanabe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CitySim is an urban simulator using large language models to model human behavior with nuanced intentions, adaptive behaviors, and realistic daily schedules, outperforming prior rigid rule-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of rigid, hand-crafted rules in modeling human behavior in urban environments, aiming for more nuanced and adaptive simulations.

Method: Uses a recursive value-driven approach for agents to generate daily schedules, incorporating beliefs, long-term goals, and spatial memory. Simulates tens of thousands of agents for collective behavior analysis.

Result: CitySim aligns better with real human behavior at micro and macro levels, demonstrating scalability and flexibility in scenarios like crowd density estimation and well-being assessment.

Conclusion: CitySim serves as a scalable, flexible testbed for understanding and forecasting urban phenomena, advancing beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: Modeling human behavior in urban environments is fundamental for social
science, behavioral studies, and urban planning. Prior work often rely on
rigid, hand-crafted rules, limiting their ability to simulate nuanced
intentions, plans, and adaptive behaviors. Addressing these challenges, we
envision an urban simulator (CitySim), capitalizing on breakthroughs in
human-level intelligence exhibited by large language models. In CitySim, agents
generate realistic daily schedules using a recursive value-driven approach that
balances mandatory activities, personal habits, and situational factors. To
enable long-term, lifelike simulations, we endow agents with beliefs, long-term
goals, and spatial memory for navigation. CitySim exhibits closer alignment
with real humans than prior work, both at micro and macro levels. Additionally,
we conduct insightful experiments by modeling tens of thousands of agents and
evaluating their collective behaviors under various real-world scenarios,
including estimating crowd density, predicting place popularity, and assessing
well-being. Our results highlight CitySim as a scalable, flexible testbed for
understanding and forecasting urban phenomena.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FAT-CAT uses Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to improve topic modeling by providing structured, hierarchical representations of topics, enhancing interpretability and insights into dataset composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic modeling methods lack interpretability, making it hard to gain deeper insights from large-scale textual datasets.

Method: Proposes FAT-CAT, an FCA-based approach for meaningful topic aggregation and visualization, handling diverse topics and file types.

Result: Demonstrated in a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, FAT-CAT outperforms existing methods in providing interpretable insights.

Conclusion: FCA-based aggregation in FAT-CAT offers more meaningful and interpretable topic representations than current techniques.

Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection
infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient
data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing
large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic
structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to
provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data
structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and
visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and
file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that
offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution.
In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based
aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset
composition than existing topic modeling techniques.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark to evaluate AI agents' ability to reproduce scientific results, using the NanoGPT speedrun as a case study. Despite detailed hints, current LLMs struggle to reimplement known innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess AI agents' capability in reproducing scientific work, a critical skill for autonomous research.

Method: The benchmark uses 19 speedrun tasks from the NanoGPT competition, providing agents with training scripts and hints (pseudocode to paper-like descriptions).

Result: Recent reasoning LLMs with state-of-the-art scaffolds fail to reimplement known innovations, even with detailed hints.

Conclusion: The benchmark offers a simple, non-saturated measure of LLMs' ability to automate scientific reproduction, a key skill for autonomous research.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to
assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is
the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to
reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM
Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the
NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.
Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records
training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from
pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records
execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse
code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to
hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible
and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that
recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement
already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our
benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to
automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an
autonomous research agent.

*Duong Bach*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HPC-ColPali improves ColPali's efficiency with hierarchical patch compression, reducing storage and computation while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high storage and computational costs of multi-vector document retrieval systems like ColPali.

Method: Uses K-Means quantization, attention-guided pruning, and optional binary encoding to compress and optimize retrieval.

Result: Achieves 30-50% lower query latency, reduces hallucination rates by 30%, and halves end-to-end latency.

Conclusion: HPC-ColPali is a scalable, efficient solution for multi-vector document retrieval.

Abstract: Multi-vector document retrieval systems, such as ColPali, excel in
fine-grained matching for complex queries but incur significant storage and
computational costs due to their reliance on high-dimensional patch embeddings
and late-interaction scoring. To address these challenges, we propose
HPC-ColPali, a Hierarchical Patch Compression framework that enhances the
efficiency of ColPali while preserving its retrieval accuracy. Our approach
integrates three innovative techniques: (1) K-Means quantization, which
compresses patch embeddings into 1-byte centroid indices, achieving up to
32$\times$ storage reduction; (2) attention-guided dynamic pruning, utilizing
Vision-Language Model attention weights to retain only the top-$p\%$ most
salient patches, reducing late-interaction computation by up to 60\% with less
than 2\% nDCG@10 loss; and (3) optional binary encoding of centroid indices
into $b$-bit strings ($b=\lceil\log_2 K\rceil$), enabling rapid Hamming
distance-based similarity search for resource-constrained environments.
Evaluated on the ViDoRe and SEC-Filings datasets, HPC-ColPali achieves 30--50\%
lower query latency under HNSW indexing while maintaining high retrieval
precision. When integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for
legal summarization, it reduces hallucination rates by 30\% and halves
end-to-end latency. These advancements establish HPC-ColPali as a scalable and
efficient solution for multi-vector document retrieval across diverse
applications. Code is available at https://github.com/DngBack/HPC-ColPali.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation frameworks lack trustworthiness, limiting enterprise adoption of multimodal AI.

Method: Introduces a systematic framework to measure trustworthiness by integrating text, images, captions, and OCR in VisualRAG systems, linking technical metrics to user trust.

Result: Optimal weighting (30% text, 15% image, 25% caption, 30% OCR) boosts performance by 57.3% over text-only baselines.

Conclusion: The framework advances responsible AI by enhancing trustworthiness in multimodal RAG for enterprise applications.

Abstract: Current evaluation frameworks for multimodal generative AI struggle to
establish trustworthiness, hindering enterprise adoption where reliability is
paramount. We introduce a systematic, quantitative benchmarking framework to
measure the trustworthiness of progressively integrating cross-modal inputs
such as text, images, captions, and OCR within VisualRAG systems for enterprise
document intelligence. Our approach establishes quantitative relationships
between technical metrics and user-centric trust measures. Evaluation reveals
that optimal modality weighting with weights of 30% text, 15% image, 25%
caption, and 30% OCR improves performance by 57.3% over text-only baselines
while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide comparative assessments
of foundation models, demonstrating their differential impact on
trustworthiness in caption generation and OCR extraction-a vital consideration
for reliable enterprise AI. This work advances responsible AI deployment by
providing a rigorous framework for quantifying and enhancing trustworthiness in
multimodal RAG for critical enterprise applications.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CAL-RAG is a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for automated layout generation, combining multimodal retrieval, LLMs, and agentic reasoning to improve semantic alignment and visual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack grounding in contextual design exemplars and struggle with semantic alignment and visual coherence in layout generation.

Method: CAL-RAG integrates multimodal retrieval, LLMs, and collaborative agentic reasoning, including a layout recommender, grader agent, and feedback agent for iterative refinement.

Result: CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, outperforming baselines in underlay effectiveness, alignment, and overlap.

Conclusion: Retrieval augmentation with agentic reasoning provides a scalable, interpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.

Abstract: Automated content-aware layout generation -- the task of arranging visual
elements such as text, logos, and underlays on a background canvas -- remains a
fundamental yet under-explored problem in intelligent design systems. While
recent advances in deep generative models and large language models (LLMs) have
shown promise in structured content generation, most existing approaches lack
grounding in contextual design exemplars and fall short in handling semantic
alignment and visual coherence. In this work we introduce CAL-RAG, a
retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for content-aware layout generation that
integrates multimodal retrieval, large language models, and collaborative
agentic reasoning. Our system retrieves relevant layout examples from a
structured knowledge base and invokes an LLM-based layout recommender to
propose structured element placements. A vision-language grader agent evaluates
the layout with visual metrics, and a feedback agent provides targeted
refinements, enabling iterative improvement. We implement our framework using
LangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in
semantic and structural variability. CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple layout metrics -- including underlay effectiveness,
element alignment, and overlap -- substantially outperforming strong baselines
such as LayoutPrompter. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval
augmentation with agentic multi-step reasoning yields a scalable,
interpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.

TL;DR: HyReC is an end-to-end optimization method for hybrid-based retrieval in Chinese, combining dense-vector and lexicon-based approaches with semantic integration and a Global-Local-Aware Encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid retrieval methods show promise but lack exploration in Chinese contexts.

Method: HyReC integrates semantic union of terms, uses GLAE for semantic sharing, and includes a Normalization Module for alignment.

Result: Evaluated on C-MTEB benchmark, HyReC demonstrates effectiveness.

Conclusion: HyReC advances hybrid retrieval in Chinese with improved performance and alignment.

Abstract: Hybrid-based retrieval methods, which unify dense-vector and lexicon-based
retrieval, have garnered considerable attention in the industry due to
performance enhancement. However, despite their promising results, the
application of these hybrid paradigms in Chinese retrieval contexts has
remained largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce HyReC, an
innovative end-to-end optimization method tailored specifically for
hybrid-based retrieval in Chinese. HyReC enhances performance by integrating
the semantic union of terms into the representation model. Additionally, it
features the Global-Local-Aware Encoder (GLAE) to promote consistent semantic
sharing between lexicon-based and dense retrieval while minimizing the
interference between them. To further refine alignment, we incorporate a
Normalization Module (NM) that fosters mutual benefits between the retrieval
approaches. Finally, we evaluate HyReC on the C-MTEB retrieval benchmark to
demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: ARAG enhances RAG for personalized recommendations using multi-agent collaboration, outperforming baselines by up to 42.1% in NDCG@5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG-based approaches lack dynamic user preference capture in recommendations.

Method: ARAG integrates four LLM-based agents for user understanding, semantic alignment, context summary, and item ranking.

Result: ARAG achieves up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5 over baselines.

Conclusion: Agentic reasoning in RAG improves personalized recommendations, offering new directions for LLM-based personalization.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing
recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language
model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static
retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic
recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which
integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To
better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG
leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that
summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural
Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between
candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent
that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that
generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate
ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG
significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving
up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an
ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our
findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into
retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based
personalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel gender fairness metric, Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), using LLMs to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking, outperforming existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of social biases in NLP and IR systems, particularly gender bias, by improving detection and evaluation methods.

Method: Leverages LLMs for bias detection, introduces CWEx metric, and annotates a subset of MS MARCO to create MSMGenderBias dataset.

Result: CWEx provides more detailed fairness evaluation, aligning better with human labels (58.77% and 18.51% agreement).

Conclusion: The work offers a robust framework for analyzing and mitigating gender bias in IR systems.

Abstract: The presence of social biases in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Information Retrieval (IR) systems is an ongoing challenge, which underlines
the importance of developing robust approaches to identifying and evaluating
such biases. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking.
Existing gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures,
leading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities.
Building on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel
gender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to
address existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed
metric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a
subset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender
bias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area.
Our extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our
proposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to
previous metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for
Grep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa
agreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating
LLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias
annotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust
framework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems.

*Xiang Li,Garrett Wen,Weiqing He,Jiayuan Wu,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses estimating the proportion of watermarked text in mixed-source content, proposing efficient estimators for identifiable watermarking schemes and validating their accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world texts often mix human-written and LLM-generated content, but existing methods focus on whole-text detection, leaving a gap for proportion estimation.

Method: The problem is framed as estimating a mixture model parameter using pivotal statistics, with focus on schemes where the parameter is identifiable. Efficient estimators are proposed and evaluated.

Result: For identifiable watermarking schemes, the proposed estimators achieve high accuracy, validated on synthetic and real mixed-source texts.

Conclusion: The study provides a solution for estimating watermark proportions in mixed texts, with theoretical and empirical support for its effectiveness.

Abstract: Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are an increasingly important
tool for detecting synthetic text and distinguishing human-written content from
LLM-generated text. While most existing studies focus on determining whether
entire texts are watermarked, many real-world scenarios involve mixed-source
texts, which blend human-written and watermarked content. In this paper, we
address the problem of optimally estimating the watermark proportion in
mixed-source texts. We cast this problem as estimating the proportion parameter
in a mixture model based on \emph{pivotal statistics}. First, we show that this
parameter is not even identifiable in certain watermarking schemes, let alone
consistently estimable. In stark contrast, for watermarking methods that employ
continuous pivotal statistics for detection, we demonstrate that the proportion
parameter is identifiable under mild conditions. We propose efficient
estimators for this class of methods, which include several popular unbiased
watermarks as examples, and derive minimax lower bounds for any measurable
estimator based on pivotal statistics, showing that our estimators achieve
these lower bounds. Through evaluations on both synthetic data and mixed-source
text generated by open-source models, we demonstrate that our proposed
estimators consistently achieve high estimation accuracy.

*Minjie Hong,Zirun Guo,Yan Xia,Zehan Wang,Ziang Zhang,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO) to improve reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by addressing performance drops and overthinking issues. It uses Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) for positive samples and Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) for negative samples, achieving significant gains in reasoning without degrading general task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with complex reasoning despite their ability to integrate diverse data. Reinforcement learning (RL) can help but often causes performance drops or overthinking in MLLMs.

Method: Proposes APO, which splits responses into positive and negative groups. DADS adjusts KL divergence weight for positive samples, while STCR penalizes overly long responses for negative samples.

Result: Applied to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, the method (View-R1-3B) improves reasoning by 7% on average and outperforms larger MLLMs on benchmarks while maintaining general task performance.

Conclusion: DADS and STCR effectively enhance complex reasoning in MLLMs without sacrificing generalization, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse
data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement
learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.
Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation
of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the
KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric
Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled
responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,
Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically
adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents
policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes
samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative
samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to
penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages
more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We
apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B
significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over
the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning
benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade
on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating
superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad
applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal
reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic control method for quality-complexity tradeoff in CNFs and DMs by rewiring transformer blocks and using consistency terms, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNFs and DMs require high computational complexity for sampling. The work aims to dynamically balance quality and complexity by adjusting time steps and neural network length.

Method: Rewires transformer blocks to solve an inner ODE and employs time- and length-wise consistency terms during training, enabling flexible sampling.

Result: Achieves up to 3Ã latency reduction and 3.5 FID score improvement in image generation on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet.

Conclusion: The proposed ODE_t (ODE_l) approach is solver-agnostic, reduces latency and memory usage, and outperforms prior methods.

Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have
been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can
generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling
demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the
number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this
work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity
tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length
of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the
transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its
length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow
matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an
arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our
$\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in
time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the
previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and
ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient
sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for
high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully
reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: CitySim aims to create a generative simulated city for autonomous vehicle testing by integrating scene generation, agent behavior, and dynamic scene control. SceneDiffuser++ is proposed as an end-to-end solution, demonstrating superior realism in large-scale simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance autonomous vehicle testing by generating synthetic miles in a simulated city, addressing gaps in dynamic scene generation and environment simulation.

Method: Proposes SceneDiffuser++, an end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function, integrating scene generation, agent behavior, occlusion reasoning, and dynamic scene control.

Result: Demonstrates city-scale traffic simulation with superior realism, evaluated on an augmented Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

Conclusion: SceneDiffuser++ successfully integrates key simulation technologies, offering a scalable and realistic solution for autonomous vehicle testing.

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of
manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much
larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision
would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an
autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate
the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and
controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g.,
vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to
this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation
technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior
modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to
seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such
as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in
various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment
simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose
SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a
single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale
integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic
simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under
long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented
version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to
support trip-level simulation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPAS is a technique to address activation variance growth in Pre-LN Transformers, improving performance without gradient issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-LN Transformers suffer from exponential activation variance growth, limiting deeper layer learning.

Method: Proposes GPAS, scaling activations while preserving gradients to maintain information and avoid vanishing gradients.

Result: GPAS improves performance across model sizes (71M to 1B) and works with other architectures like Sandwich-LN and DeepNorm.

Conclusion: GPAS is versatile, enhancing training dynamics in various Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series,
predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While
being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN
suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers,
causing the residual path to dominate over sub-layer outputs and limiting the
learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple technique that can be
used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works by scaling down the
intermediate activations while keeping their gradients unchanged. This leaves
information in the activations intact, and avoids the gradient vanishing
problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive experiments across
various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves consistent
performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also shows
promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and
DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training
dynamics in a wide range of settings.

*Laura van Weesep,Samuel Genheden,Ola Engkvist,Jens SjÃ¶lund*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines modularity in LLM-based agentic systems for drug discovery, comparing model performance and agent types, emphasizing the need for prompt re-engineering and further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the interchangeability of LLMs and agent types in drug discovery, a topic with limited prior attention.

Method: Comparison of different LLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, Nova-Micro) and agent types (tool-calling vs. code-generating) using an LLM-as-a-judge score.

Result: Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o outperform others; code-generating agents generally perform better but results vary by question and model.

Conclusion: Modularity in agentic systems requires careful prompt re-engineering, and further research is needed for stable, scalable solutions.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery and design. In this study, we
critically examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug
discovery, i.e., whether parts of the agentic system such as the LLM are
interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery
applications. We compare the performance of different large language models
(LLMs) and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating
agents in this domain. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating
tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows
that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative
language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and
Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the
tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question and model
dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on
the specific question asked and the model used, underscoring that -- even in
this particular domain -- one cannot just replace language models without
considering prompt re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of
further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the
development of stable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.

*Erkan Turan,Aristotelis Siozopoulos,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Koopman-enhanced Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) accelerates sampling and improves interpretability by using linear dynamics in a learned latent space, enabling one-step sampling and structured analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFM relies on computationally expensive non-linear ODEs for sampling, and existing speed-up methods lack interpretability of the generative process.

Method: Integrates Koopman operator theory to model non-linear flows as linear dynamics in a learned latent space, enabling closed-form sampling via matrix exponentiation.

Result: Achieves significant speedups on 2D datasets and benchmarks (MNIST, F-MNIST, TFD) while providing interpretable spectral properties of the generative process.

Conclusion: Koopman-CFM combines fast sampling with interpretability, advancing generative modeling by offering structured insights into dynamics.

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for
training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based
approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving
non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to
interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory
straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods
typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the
generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an
interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator
theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of
observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns
an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,
one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant
speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and
real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face
Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured
Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions
offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal
scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By
combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow
matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative
modeling.

*Maciej Stefaniak,MichaÅ Krutul,Jan MaÅaÅnicki,Maciej PiÃ³ro,Jakub Krajewski,Sebastian Jaszczur,Marek Cygan,Kamil Adamczewski,Jan Ludziejewski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Projected Compression reduces model size using projection modules without increasing FLOPs, outperforming pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing inference time and computational demands of large language models by reducing their size.

Method: Train additional projection weights, merge them into a lower-dimensional matrix, and maintain original model parameters.

Result: Outperforms hard pruning and retraining, with performance scaling well with token count.

Conclusion: Projected Compression is an efficient method for model size reduction without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved
performance; however, this growth has also led to greater inference time and
computational demands. Consequently, there is rising interest in model size
reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a
novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing
projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable
projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters.
Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product
matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike
alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our
method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs.
Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable
hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the
performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.

### [216] [Probabilistic Optimality for Inference-time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22376)
*Youkang Wang,Jian Wang,Rubing Chen,Xiao-Yong Wei,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic framework for inference-time scaling in LLMs, proposing the \textsc{OptScale} algorithm to dynamically optimize sample size for performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time scaling methods lack a principled foundation, relying on heuristics. This work aims to provide theoretical and practical solutions for efficient scaling.

Method: The authors propose a probabilistic framework assuming i.i.d. parallel samples and derive a theoretical lower bound for sample size. They develop \textsc{OptScale}, which uses a language model to estimate parameters and dynamically adjust samples.

Result: \textsc{OptScale} reduces sampling overhead while matching or outperforming state-of-the-art reasoning performance on benchmarks like MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC.

Conclusion: The work bridges a critical gap by offering a theoretical foundation and practical algorithm for efficient inference-time scaling in LLMs.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the
reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing
approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a
principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic
framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the
assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed
(i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability
distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a
theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target
performance level, providing the first principled guidance for
compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop
\textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the
optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language
model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the
decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined
performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC)
demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead
while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance.
Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for
principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient
deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

TL;DR: RiverEcho is an interactive system using a large language model and cultural knowledge dataset to promote Yellow River culture through voice queries and digital human responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To conserve and inherit the ancient Yellow River culture by leveraging technology.

Result: Improved response quality, providing more professional and informative answers about Yellow River culture.

Conclusion: RiverEcho effectively promotes Yellow River culture and offers deeper cultural insights to users.

Abstract: The Yellow River is China's mother river and a cradle of human civilization.
The ancient Yellow River culture is, moreover, an indispensable part of human
art history. To conserve and inherit the ancient Yellow River culture, we
designed RiverEcho, a real-time interactive system that responds to voice
queries using a large language model and a cultural knowledge dataset,
delivering explanations through a talking-head digital human. Specifically, we
built a knowledge database focused on the ancient Yellow River culture,
including the collection of historical texts and the processing pipeline.
Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) on the proposed dataset enhances the response quality of the Large

*Michael A. Riegler,Kristoffer Herland Hellton,Vajira Thambawita,Hugo L. Hammer*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: LLMs like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT can suggest Bayesian priors, but calibration of prior width is a challenge. Claude outperforms in weakly informative priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting Bayesian priors is difficult and subjective; LLMs offer an efficient, objective alternative.

Method: Evaluated LLMs (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) on real datasets (heart disease, concrete strength) using KL divergence to measure prior quality.

Result: LLMs correctly identified associations but varied in prior quality. Claude excelled in weakly informative priors.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for prior selection but need better calibration to avoid over-/under-confidence.

Abstract: Selecting prior distributions in Bayesian statistics is challenging,
resource-intensive, and subjective. We analyze using large-language models
(LLMs) to suggest suitable, knowledge-based informative priors. We developed an
extensive prompt asking LLMs not only to suggest priors but also to verify and
reflect on their choices.
  We evaluated Claude Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ChatGPT-4o-mini on two real
datasets: heart disease risk and concrete strength. All LLMs correctly
identified the direction for all associations (e.g., that heart disease risk is
higher for males). The quality of suggested priors was measured by their
Kullback-Leibler divergence from the maximum likelihood estimator's
distribution.
  The LLMs suggested both moderately and weakly informative priors. The
moderate priors were often overconfident, resulting in distributions misaligned
with the data. In our experiments, Claude and Gemini provided better priors
than ChatGPT. For weakly informative priors, a key performance difference
emerged: ChatGPT and Gemini defaulted to an "unnecessarily vague" mean of 0,
while Claude did not, demonstrating a significant advantage.
  The ability of LLMs to identify correct associations shows their great
potential as an efficient, objective method for developing informative priors.
However, the primary challenge remains in calibrating the width of these priors
to avoid over- and under-confidence.

*Liav Hen,Erez Yosef,Dan Raviv,Raja Giryes,Jacob Scheuer*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion model-based approach for inverse design of metasurfaces, overcoming challenges like local minima and computational overhead, and demonstrates its effectiveness with low-error designs in under 30 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inverse design of metasurfaces is complex and computationally intensive, often requiring expert tuning and suffering from local minima. This work aims to simplify and improve the process using generative diffusion models.

Method: The authors integrate diffusion models into computational design workflows, training a conditional diffusion model on metasurface geometries and their optical responses. The model predicts geometry and height from target optical properties.

Result: The approach successfully designs metasurfaces (e.g., intensity and polarization beam splitters) with low error in under 30 minutes, either directly or as an initializer for optimization.

Conclusion: The diffusion model-based method offers an efficient and effective solution for metasurface design, with publicly released code and datasets to support further research.

Abstract: Metasurfaces are ultra-thin optical elements composed of engineered
sub-wavelength structures that enable precise control of light. Their inverse
design - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is
challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and
optical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local
minima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we
address these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of
diffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator,
we generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their
corresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional
diffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial
power distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous
supported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low
error, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an
initializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach
on the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam
splitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes. To support further
research in data-driven metasurface design, we publicly release our code and
datasets.

Motivation: Existing datasets and models focus on urban or wide off-road settings, leaving a gap for narrow trail-like scenarios, which are critical for applications like search and rescue or forest fire management.

Method: The study proposes TOMD, a dataset with multimodal sensor data (LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, illumination), and a dynamic multiscale fusion model for pathway prediction. It evaluates early, cross, and mixed fusion strategies under varying illumination.

Result: The approach proves effective, with illumination playing a significant role in segmentation performance.

Conclusion: TOMD and the proposed model advance trail-based off-road navigation research, with the dataset publicly released for further study.

Abstract: Detecting traversable pathways in unstructured outdoor environments remains a
significant challenge for autonomous robots, especially in critical
applications such as wide-area search and rescue, as well as incident
management scenarios like forest fires. Existing datasets and models primarily
target urban settings or wide, vehicle-traversable off-road tracks, leaving a
substantial gap in addressing the complexity of narrow, trail-like off-road
scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Trail-based Off-road Multimodal
Dataset (TOMD), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for such
environments. TOMD features high-fidelity multimodal sensor data -- including
128-channel LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, and illumination measurements --
collected through repeated traversals under diverse conditions. We also propose
a dynamic multiscale data fusion model for accurate traversable pathway
prediction. The study analyzes the performance of early, cross, and mixed
fusion strategies under varying illumination levels. Results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach and the relevance of illumination in segmentation
performance. We publicly release TOMD at https://github.com/yyyxs1125/TMOD to

TL;DR: A vision-based system, AeroLite-MDNet, is proposed for UAV landing deviation warning, achieving high accuracy and low delay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safe UAV landings is critical but challenging due to GPS interference.

Method: Uses a multiscale fusion module for object detection and a segmentation branch for orientation estimation, evaluated with a new metric (AWD) and dataset (UAVLandData).

Result: Achieves 98.6% deviation detection accuracy and 0.7s AWD.

Conclusion: The system enhances UAV landing reliability and is supported by open-source code.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed in diverse
applications such as land surveying, material transport, and environmental
monitoring. Following missions like data collection or inspection, UAVs must
land safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an
essential requirement for ensuring operational continuity. However, accurate
landing remains challenging due to factors like GPS signal interference. To
address this issue, we propose a deviation warning system for UAV landings,
powered by a novel vision-based model called AeroLite-MDNet. This model
integrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection
and incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We
introduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the
system's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new
dataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to
support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system
achieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6\%,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing UAV landing reliability. Code will

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of accurate analytical models for skid-slip wheel terrain interactions in skid-steered vehicles hinders automation deployment, prompting the need for learning-based solutions.

Method: The paper introduces a structured formulation for learning visual navigation, leveraging end-to-end learning methods like imitation and deep reinforcement learning.

Result: Extensive simulations and hardware evaluations demonstrate the proposed approach's superior performance compared to contemporary methods.

Conclusion: The structured learning approach effectively addresses challenges in skid-steered vehicle automation, showing promise for dynamic operation regimes.

Abstract: Vision-based lane keeping is a topic of significant interest in the robotics
and autonomous ground vehicles communities in various on-road and off-road
applications. The skid-steered vehicle architecture has served as a useful
vehicle platform for human controlled operations. However, systematic modeling,
especially of the skid-slip wheel terrain interactions (primarily in off-road
settings) has created bottlenecks for automation deployment. End-to-end
learning based methods such as imitation learning and deep reinforcement
learning, have gained prominence as a viable deployment option to counter the
lack of accurate analytical models. However, the systematic formulation and
subsequent verification/validation in dynamic operation regimes (particularly
for skid-steered vehicles) remains a work in progress. To this end, a novel
approach for structured formulation for learning visual navigation is proposed
and investigated in this work. Extensive software simulations, hardware
evaluations and ablation studies now highlight the significantly improved
performance of the proposed approach against contemporary literature.

Conclusion: The EDAOD benchmark and SFDA approach effectively address domain shifts in indoor environments, enhancing object detection robustness.

Abstract: Mobile robots rely on object detectors for perception and object localization

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of KANs in quantum machine learning by leveraging their efficient function representation capabilities.

Method: Implementation of KANs in hybrid (classical-quantum) and fully quantum forms using QCBMs, with pre-trained residual functions for transfer learning.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility, interpretability, and performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.

Conclusion: QuKANs successfully bridge KANs and quantum computing, offering a novel approach for quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold
representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in
expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by
implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike
traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs
potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this
work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid
and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt
the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the
representational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we
combine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully
quantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated
to a quantum model. We demonstrate the feasibility, interpretability and
performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.

TL;DR: DCAR introduces a dynamic chunk-wise autoregressive framework for speech synthesis, improving efficiency and intelligibility by reducing sequence length dependency and enhancing attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional AR speech synthesis models face challenges with long sequences, leading to latency and quality issues, limiting real-time applications.

Method: DCAR uses a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism with multi-token prediction, dynamically adjusting token spans for better performance.

Result: DCAR achieves 72.27% intelligibility improvement and 2.61x inference speedup over traditional models.

Conclusion: DCAR is a versatile foundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems, addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) language models have emerged as a dominant
approach in speech synthesis, offering expressive generation and scalable
training. However, conventional AR speech synthesis models relying on the
next-token prediction paradigm often encounter significant challenges when
handling long speech sequences. These models often struggle to construct stable
frame-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis
quality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we introduce a novel dynamic chunk-wise
autoregressive synthesis framework, termed DCAR, designed to enhance both
efficiency and intelligibility robustness in AR speech generation. DCAR
introduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with
multi-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech
contexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts
the token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length
dependency while obtaining high synthesis quality. Comprehensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that DCAR substantially outperforms traditional
next-token prediction models, achieving up to 72.27% intelligibility
improvement and 2.61x inference speedup simultaneously on the test set.
Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive analysis to support it as a versatile
foundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems.

Motivation: To improve the alignment accuracy of human piano performances with MIDI files, addressing timing errors.

Method: Uses a CRNN to process unaligned piano rolls and spectrograms, trained on augmented MIDI data simulating human timing errors.

Result: Achieves 20% higher accuracy than DTW, with additional improvements when combined with DTW.

Conclusion: Neural networks, especially CRNNs, can significantly enhance MIDI-to-audio alignment, surpassing traditional methods like DTW.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach for synchronizing audio
recordings of human piano performances with their corresponding loosely aligned
MIDI files. The task is addressed using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural
Network (CRNN) architecture, which effectively captures spectral and temporal
features by processing an unaligned piano roll and a spectrogram as inputs to
estimate the aligned piano roll. To train the network, we create a dataset of
piano pieces with augmented MIDI files that simulate common human timing
errors. The proposed model achieves up to 20% higher alignment accuracy than
the industry-standard Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method across various
tolerance windows. Furthermore, integrating DTW with the CRNN yields additional
improvements, offering enhanced robustness and consistency. These findings
demonstrate the potential of neural networks in advancing state-of-the-art
MIDI-to-audio alignment.
