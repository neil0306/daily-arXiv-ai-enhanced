We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories.

First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution.

One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens.

In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous).

Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision.

Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework.

In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics.

We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.\n  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction.

However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM).

This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results.

Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as \"re-indexing\". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner.

In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem.

This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios.

The model ingests recent displacement snapshots together with (i) static kinematic indicators (mean velocity, acceleration, seasonal amplitude) computed in a leakage-safe manner from the training window only, and (ii) harmonic day-of-year encodings. On the eastern Ireland tile (E32N34), the STGCN is strongest in the displacement-only setting, whereas the multimodal Transformer clearly outperforms CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM+Attn, and multimodal STGCN when all models receive the same multimodal inputs, achieving RMSE = 0.90 mm and $R^2$ = 0.97 on the test set with the best threshold accuracies.", "AI": {"tldr": "A multimodal patch-based Transformer model for nowcasting ground deformation from InSAR time series, achieving high accuracy in predicting next-epoch displacement maps.", "motivation": "Near-real-time monitoring of ground deformation is crucial for urban planning, infrastructure management, and hazard mitigation, but predicting future observations from past InSAR data is challenging due to complex signal superposition and spatial heterogeneity.", "method": "Proposes a multimodal patch-based Transformer for single-step, fixed-interval next-epoch nowcasting of displacement maps from EGMS time series.

However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process.

Code: https://github.com/alexlioralexli/generative-classifiers", "summary": "Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "Generative classifiers using class-conditional generative models outperform discriminative approaches on distribution shift by modeling all features rather than relying on spurious correlations.", "motivation": "Discriminative classifiers often fail under distribution shift because they learn shortcuts and over-rely on features that are spuriously correlated with labels.
