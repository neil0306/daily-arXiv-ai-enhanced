### [1] [Enhancing Biomedical Named Entity Recognition using GLiNER-BioMed with Targeted Dictionary-Based Post-processing for BioASQ 2025 task 6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08588)
*Ritesh Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluated GLiNER-BioMed model on BioASQ BioNER task, introduced dictionary-based post-processing that improved F1-score on development set but failed to generalize to blind test set, highlighting overfitting challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BioNER faces challenges in distinguishing similar entity types like genes and chemicals, and there's a need to improve performance of pre-trained models through targeted refinement strategies.

Method: Evaluated GLiNER-BioMed model on BioASQ dataset and introduced a dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common misclassifications. Also explored alternative methods including Conditional Random Fields.

Result: Post-processing improved micro F1-score from 0.79 to 0.83 on development set, but failed to generalize to blind test set (0.77 vs baseline 0.79).

Conclusion: Dictionary-based refinement shows potential for pre-trained BioNER models but faces critical challenges with overfitting to development data and requires robust generalization for real-world applicability.

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in
large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial
for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as
distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This
study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a
targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common
misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable
improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a
baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test
set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared
to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring
alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work
highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER
models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development
data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world
applicability.

### [2] [Less Diverse, Less Safe: The Indirect But Pervasive Risk of Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08592)
*Shahriar Kabir Nahin,Hadi Askari,Muhao Chen,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods for LLM reasoning have a critical vulnerability: when candidate diversity is reduced, they become much more likely to produce unsafe outputs, even with modest diversity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and demonstrate a previously unrecognized failure mode in TTS methods where reduced candidate diversity significantly increases the likelihood of unsafe outputs, challenging the assumption that diverse candidate pools always enhance reliability.

Method: Developed RefDiv, a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines, and conducted experiments across multiple open-source and closed-source models using different TTS strategies.

Result: Constraining diversity consistently increases unsafe output rates across all tested models and TTS strategies, with effects often stronger than direct adversarial prompts. Existing safety classifiers fail to detect these adversarial inputs.

Conclusion: TTS methods have a fundamental vulnerability to diversity reduction attacks, and current safety defenses offer limited protection, highlighting the need for more robust TTS strategies that are secure against diversity-targeted stress tests.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

### [3] [Hierarchical Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Depression Detection from Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08593)
*Yuxin Li,Eng Siong Chng,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAREN-CTC is a novel architecture for speech-based depression detection that integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention and CTC loss to handle sparse temporal supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech-based depression detection methods rely only on final layer or single best-performing SSL features, overfitting to datasets and failing to leverage full hierarchical structure needed for subtle depression signals.

Method: Proposes HAREN-CTC with two modules: Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering that reorganizes SSL features into complementary embeddings, and Cross-Modal Fusion that models inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention, combined with CTC loss for alignment-aware training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on MODMA datasets, outperforming prior methods in both standard data splits and cross-validation settings.

Conclusion: HAREN-CTC effectively leverages multi-layer SSL features through hierarchical organization and cross-attention, enabling robust detection of sparse, heterogeneous depressive speech cues across different evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

### [4] [Systematic Diagnosis of Brittle Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08595)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for measuring mathematical reasoning in AI models by analyzing step-by-step reasoning on GSM8K, identifying specific failure points through error categorization and unsupervised clustering of reasoning modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the extent of mathematical comprehension in machine learning models beyond standard benchmarks by diagnosing specific failure points and cognitive profiles.

Method: Generate structured step-by-step reasoning from GPT-3.5-turbo on GSM8K dataset, then use GPT-4o-mini to categorize errors and perform unsupervised clustering of reasoning sentences to identify emergent reasoning modes.

Result: Reveals a nonhuman-like brittleness: near-perfect accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, but performance plummets on modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions.

Conclusion: Provides a granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable AI applications.

Abstract: A central question in artificial intelligence is the extent to which machine
learning models comprehend mathematics. To address this, we propose a novel
framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that moves beyond standard
benchmarks to diagnose specific failure points. Our method first generates
structured, step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5-turbo on the GSM8K dataset. We
then use a more capable analyst model, gpt-4o-mini, to categorize errors and,
crucially, perform an unsupervised clustering of every reasoning sentence to
identify emergent "reasoning modes." This analysis reveals a cognitive profile
with a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness: while the model achieves near-perfect
accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, its performance on
modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions plummets. By
identifying and quantifying the reliability of these distinct reasoning skills,
our work provides a more granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension
and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable
future applications.

### [5] [Confidence, Not Perplexity: A Better Metric for the Creative Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08596)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Confidence Score (CS) as a less biased alternative to reference-free metrics like self-perplexity, which are biased against creative text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reference-free metrics like self-perplexity show strong bias against creative text generation, favoring conventional responses over novel ones.

Method: Proposed Confidence Score (CS) derived from a model's output probability distribution, tested on gpt-4o-mini with 99 creative prompts.

Result: CS preferred novel responses 19% of the time vs 0% for fluency-based metrics, with statistically significant difference (95% CI: [11.1%, 27.3%]). CS also effectively distinguished between easy, medium, and hard tasks.

Conclusion: Confidence Score mitigates creativity bias of traditional metrics while retaining their evaluative strengths, offering more balanced assessment for modern LLMs.

Abstract: Reference-free metrics like self-perplexity are strongly biased against
creative text generation. We propose the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a
model's output probability distribution, as a less biased alternative.
Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel
responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the
time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%,
27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium,
and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The
Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics
while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced
assessment for modern LLMs.

### [6] [Recover-LoRA: Data-Free Accuracy Recovery of Degraded Language Models via Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08600)
*Devleena Das,Rajeev Patwari,Ashish Sirasao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recover-LoRA is a lightweight method that uses synthetic data and logit distillation to recover accuracy in degraded language models through selective layer LoRA adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference optimizations like quantization, pruning, and serialization can degrade model performance, and existing recovery methods mainly focus on quantization issues.

Method: Uses synthetic data and logit distillation to train LoRA adapters on selective layers, aligning degraded models with their full precision versions.

Result: Recovers model accuracies by 5-17% on both MHA and GQA small language models across diverse evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: Recover-LoRA provides an effective dataset-agnostic solution for recovering accuracy from various sources of model degradation.

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

### [7] [Mnemosyne: An Unsupervised, Human-Inspired Long-Term Memory Architecture for Edge-Based LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08601)
*Aneesh Jonelagadda,Christina Hahn,Haoze Zheng,Salvatore Penachio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mnemosyne is an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term memory architecture for edge-based LLMs that uses graph-structured storage, filtering mechanisms, and probabilistic recall to enable realistic dialogue in longitudinal applications like healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM memory systems fail on edge-constrained devices and use brute-force context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that don't handle repetitive, semantically similar conversations well, especially in longitudinal applications like healthcare.

Method: Graph-structured storage with modular substance and redundancy filters, memory committing and pruning mechanisms, probabilistic recall with temporal decay and refresh processes, and a concentrated "core summary" derived from memory graph subsets.

Result: Achieved 65.8% win rate in blind human evaluations vs 31.1% for baseline RAG, highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval, and second highest overall score of 54.6% beating Mem0 and OpenAI baselines.

Conclusion: Improved factual recall, enhanced temporal reasoning, and more natural user-facing responses are feasible with an edge-compatible, unsupervised memory architecture that's easily transferable.

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

### [8] [Human Texts Are Outliers: Detecting LLM-generated Texts via Out-of-distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08602)
*Cong Zeng,Shengkun Tang,Yuanzhou Chen,Zhiqiang Shen,Wenchao Yu,Xujiang Zhao,Haifeng Chen,Wei Cheng,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reframes AI-generated text detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem rather than binary classification, using one-class learning methods to achieve robust generalization across domains and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing binary classification approaches for AI-generated text detection suffer from poor generalization because they incorrectly assume human-written texts form a coherent distribution, when in reality human texts are highly diverse and cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling.

Method: Proposes an OOD detection framework using one-class learning methods (DeepSVDD and HRN) and score-based learning techniques (energy-based method), treating machine-generated texts as in-distribution samples and human-written texts as distributional outliers.

Result: Achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake dataset. Demonstrates robust performance across multilingual, attacked, and unseen-model/domain text settings.

Conclusion: Reframing AI-generated text detection as an OOD problem enables more robust and generalizable detection performance compared to traditional binary classification approaches, effectively addressing the fundamental limitation of assuming human texts form a unified distribution.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

### [9] [YpathRAG:A Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework and Benchmark for Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08603)
*Deshui Yu,Yizhi Wang,Saihui Jin,Taojie Zhu,Fanyi Zeng,Wen Qian,Zirui Huang,Jingli Ouyang,Jiameng Li,Zhen Song,Tian Guan,Yonghong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: YpathRAG is a pathology-oriented RAG framework that uses dual-channel hybrid retrieval and evidence judgment to improve LLM performance in pathology, achieving significant gains in retrieval quality and factual reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs hallucinate in high-barrier domains like pathology, and prior domain fine-tuning approaches don't expand knowledge boundaries or enforce evidence-grounded constraints.

Method: Built a pathology vector database covering 28 subfields with 1.53M paragraphs, developed YpathRAG with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3 dense + vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and LLM-based evidence judgment module.

Result: On YpathR benchmark: Recall@5 of 98.64% (23 percentage point gain over baseline). On YpathQA-M (300 most challenging questions): increased accuracies of general and medical LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%.

Conclusion: YpathRAG demonstrates improved retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in
high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain
fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces
evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database
covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a
pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3
dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an
LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the
retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks,
YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of
23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most
challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical
LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved
retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction
paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.

### [10] [LatentBreak: Jailbreaking Large Language Models through Latent Space Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08604)
*Raffaele Mura,Giorgio Piras,Kamilė Lukošiūtė,Maura Pintor,Amin Karbasi,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LatentBreak is a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with low perplexity by substituting words with semantically-equivalent ones, evading perplexity-based defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak attacks can be detected by straightforward perplexity-based filtering on input prompts, so there's a need for attacks that generate natural-looking prompts with low perplexity.

Method: Substitutes words in input prompts with semantically-equivalent alternatives by minimizing distance in latent space between adversarial prompts and harmless requests, avoiding high-perplexity suffixes or long templates.

Result: LatentBreak generates shorter, low-perplexity prompts that outperform competing jailbreak algorithms against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

Conclusion: LatentBreak successfully evades perplexity-based defenses by creating natural adversarial prompts through semantic word substitution in latent space.

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

TL;DR: A multilingual LLM framework with retrieval-augmented generation that detects misinformation through language-switching, query inflation, and structural reformatting attacks, deployable as a web plugin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat the threat of misinformation spread on digital platforms that affects public discourse, emotional stability, and decision-making, by addressing previously unstudied adversarial transformations.

Method: Multilingual, multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation, deployed as a web plugin. Studies language-switching across 6 languages with translation, query length inflation before summarization, and structural reformatting into multiple-choice questions.

Result: The framework demonstrates effectiveness against diverse misinformation attacks and showcases feasible plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.

Conclusion: AI-driven misinformation detection is crucial for safeguarding online factual integrity, and plugin-based deployment offers practical real-world implementation for combating diverse misinformation attacks.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms threatens public
discourse, emotional stability, and decision-making. While prior work has
explored various adversarial attacks in misinformation detection, the specific
transformations examined in this paper have not been systematically studied. In
particular, we investigate language-switching across English, French, Spanish,
Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese, followed by translation. We also study query length
inflation preceding summarization and structural reformatting into
multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we present a multilingual,
multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation
that can be deployed as a web plugin into online platforms. Our work
underscores the importance of AI-driven misinformation detection in
safeguarding online factual integrity against diverse attacks, while showcasing
the feasibility of plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.

### [12] [Centering Emotion Hotspots: Multimodal Local-Global Fusion and Cross-Modal Alignment for Emotion Recognition in Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08606)
*Yu Liu,Hanlei Shi,Haoxun Li,Yuqing Sun,Yuxuan Ding,Linlin Gong,Leyuan Qu,Taihao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hotspot-centric approach for Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) that focuses on detecting emotion-relevant spans in text, audio, and video, using Hotspot-Gated Fusion and Mixture-of-Aligners to handle modality misalignment and preserve context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC is challenging because discriminative evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across different modalities, requiring better methods to identify and fuse relevant information.

Method: A unified model that detects per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed Mixture-of-Aligners, with a cross-modal graph encoding conversational structure.

Result: Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of Hotspot-Gated Fusion and Mixture-of-Aligners.

Conclusion: The hotspot-centric view offers a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC and can inform future multimodal learning approaches.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMA-ASIA is a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs' cultural awareness in Asian contexts through a multilingual, multimodal benchmark with 27,000 questions across 8 countries and 10 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' multimodal understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource settings, highlighting the need to evaluate cultural awareness in diverse contexts.

Method: Human-curated multilingual multimodal benchmark with 27,000 questions, cross-modal alignment, five-dimensional evaluation protocol, Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module, and analysis methods including Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR).

Result: The framework enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer and measures cultural-awareness disparities, cross-lingual consistency, cross-modal consistency, cultural knowledge generalization, and grounding validity.

Conclusion: MMA-ASIA provides actionable insights for building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs by probing why models diverge across languages and modalities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal
understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource
settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs'
cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct
answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an
innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for
building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphGhost is a unified framework that represents neuron activations and signal propagation in LLMs as graphs, enabling analysis of reasoning mechanisms through graph algorithms and structural interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structural mechanisms underlying LLMs' reasoning capabilities, which remain under explored despite their remarkable performance.

Method: Represent neuron activations and signal propagation as graphs, use graph algorithms like PageRank to characterize properties, and perform structural interventions by editing key neuron nodes.

Result: Revealed both shared and model-specific reasoning behaviors across datasets, and showed that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse affecting logical flow and semantic understanding.

Conclusion: GraphGhost serves as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored.
In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents
neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs
capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs
through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective
enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the
properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning
behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons
within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing
that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both
logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position
GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately
understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMs in healthcare show gender bias inconsistencies in judging patient gender relevance for diagnosis, despite relatively consistent diagnoses across different LLM gender assignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs replicate or amplify gender-related biases in clinical decision-making, given that gender has historically influenced physician behaviors and patient outcomes.

Method: Used case studies from NEJM Challenge, assigned different genders (female, male, unspecified) to various open-source and proprietary LLMs, and evaluated response consistency across LLM-gender assignments for diagnosis and judgments on patient gender relevance/necessity.

Result: Diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most models, but all models showed substantial inconsistency in judging patient gender relevance and necessity, particularly for relevance judgments, with some models displaying systematic female-male disparity.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit an underexplored bias that could undermine reliability in clinical practice, highlighting the need for routine checks of identity-assignment consistency to ensure equitable AI-supported clinical care.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds promise
to enhance clinical decision-making, yet their susceptibility to biases remains
a critical concern. Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient
outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as
clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related
biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge
(NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple
open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency
across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models'
judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our
findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most
models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based
diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM
genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a
systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender.
These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the
reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine
checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure
reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.

*Kaiqi Yang,Hang Li,Yucheng Chu,Zitao Liu,Mi Tian,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an automated framework using LLMs to generate math word problems with distracting conditions while preserving original solutions, addressing limitations in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math word problem datasets lack distracting conditions, making them unreliable for evaluating LLM reasoning. Current datasets have low difficulty and out-of-context expressions that are easy to detect.

Method: An iterative framework using LLMs with specialized prompts to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, generating distracting conditions that don't alter original solutions.

Result: The framework efficiently generates high-quality MWPs with meaningful distracting conditions while eliminating the need for manual solution rewriting.

Conclusion: The proposed method substantially reduces effort in creating challenging MWP datasets with distracting conditions, improving benchmarking credibility for LLM mathematical reasoning evaluation.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the
intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs)
represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets
contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or
excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that
popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting
conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting
conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context
expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect
and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these
datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning
process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and
rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs
to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts
to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the
creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for
further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of
shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are
explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original
solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is
efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to
generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

*Juan Miguel Navarro Carranza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method to test LLM generalization by evaluating on paraphrased benchmark questions reveals accuracy drops, indicating memorization and surface-form shortcuts rather than true understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about benchmark score inflation due to memorization of test items or near duplicates in LLMs.

Method: A protocol that re-evaluates models on paraphrased versions of benchmark questions, using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge with controlled decoding and robust paraphrase-cleaning.

Result: Paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop between original and paraphrased items, consistent with contamination concerns and brittle surface-form shortcuts.

Conclusion: The study confirms that LLMs may rely on memorization and surface-level patterns rather than genuine reasoning, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods.

Abstract: Benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) can be inflated by
memorization of test items or near duplicates. We present a simple, protocol
that probes generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of
benchmark questions. Using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, we
measure the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge. Our pipeline controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output
format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics.
We find that paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop (original vs.
paraphrased), consistent with prior concerns about contamination and brittle
surface-form shortcuts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JAI-1 is a 75B parameter Thai-centric language model that uses an upscaling strategy to integrate Thai knowledge while preserving general intelligence, outperforming Typhoon2-70B on Thai benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Thai models risk eroding pre-existing knowledge when adding Thai-specific information through additional training on existing models. JAI-1 aims to preserve general intelligence while systematically integrating Thai language knowledge.

Method: Upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller high-performing English LLM, expanding parameter space and using new capacity to integrate Thai knowledge. Pre-trained on 1.5T tokens (300B+ Thai tokens), followed by supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning with 600K+ instruction examples.

Result: Superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks (IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of the upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

Conclusion: The upscaling approach successfully preserves original model intelligence while establishing a unique architecture for scalable Thai language integration, demonstrating an effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with
75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing
open-source models, applying additional training without structural
modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding
pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of
Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may
conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an
upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English
open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly
allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This
methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but
also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models,
enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed
to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by
post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using
more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated
superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks
(IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its
upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

TL;DR: A sales dialogue agent adapts to user profiles, with occupation being the most influential factor. A lightweight occupation-conditioned strategy improves dialogue success and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop realistic user-simulator studies for tuning effective conversation strategies in sales-oriented dialogue systems by leveraging user profile information.

Method: Introduce a lightweight occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents aligned with user preferences based on age, gender, and occupation profiles.

Result: Occupation produces the most pronounced differences in conversational intent. The occupation-conditioned strategy results in shorter and more successful dialogues compared to other profile factors.

Conclusion: Rich simulator profiles are important, and simple persona-informed strategies can significantly enhance the effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator
studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work
investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user
profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence
overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in
conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight,
occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents
aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful
dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and
demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the
effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

*Francesco Dente,Fabiano Dalpiaz,Paolo Papotti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2Stories introduces metrics for evaluating how well software requirements (user stories) align with stakeholder needs from interview transcripts, measuring correctness and completeness through automated text-to-story alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of whether LLM-generated requirements faithfully reflect stakeholder needs remains largely manual, creating a need for automated metrics to assess text-to-story alignment.

Method: Segment interview transcripts into chunks and formulate alignment as a matching problem between chunks and user stories. Use LLM-based matcher and embedding models to quantify correctness (proportion of stories supported by transcript) and completeness (proportion of transcript covered by stories).

Result: LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out annotations across four datasets. Embedding models alone perform worse but enable effective blocking for the matching process.

Conclusion: Text2Stories provides scalable, source-faithful metrics that complement existing user-story quality criteria and enable comparison across different sets of stories (human vs. generated).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

*Anubhav Shrimal,Aryan Jain,Soumyajit Chowdhury,Promod Yenigalla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARSE is a system that autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM-based structured information extraction, improving accuracy and reducing errors through automated schema refinement and reflection-based extraction with guardrails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches treat JSON schemas as static contracts designed for humans, leading to suboptimal extraction performance, hallucinations, and unreliable agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous specifications.

Method: PARSE has two components: ARCHITECT for autonomous JSON schema optimization with backward compatibility through RELAY code generation, and SCOPE for reflection-based extraction with static and LLM-based guardrails.

Result: Achieves up to 64.7% improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE dataset, with combined framework improvements reaching 10% across models, reducing extraction errors by 92% within first retry while maintaining practical latency.

Conclusion: JSON schemas should be treated as dynamic contracts that LLMs can interpret and systematically improve, enabling more reliable structured information extraction for autonomous agent systems.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for
emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs
and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction
tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or
reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON
schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to
suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable
agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We
recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language
understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations
about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and
systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated
Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic
components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM
consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an
integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements
reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We
evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including
Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and
internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7%
improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements
reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the
first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

*Nisar Ahmed,Muhammad Imran Zaman,Gulshan Saleem,Ali Hassan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation-scented prompts inflate LLM performance metrics without real capability gains, showing increased reasoning length and reduced answer compliance but inconsistent accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether benchmark evaluation methods that use rubric-scented prompts artificially inflate LLM performance measurements compared to real-world deployment scenarios.

Method: Used GPT-OSS-20B model in six paired A/B scenarios varying framing (evaluation vs real-world) and reasoning depth, with deterministic validators measuring accuracy, compliance, and reasoning patterns.

Result: Evaluation framing reliably increased chain-of-thought length and reduced answer-only compliance, with limited accuracy gains. Structured output improvements were superficial (formatting) not substantive.

Conclusion: Benchmark gains may not reflect deployable capability; recommend neutral phrasing, dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, and style-delta reporting for more realistic evaluations.

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented
prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real
deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such
"evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate
capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six
paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying
framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High):
deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips
(caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers.
Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance,
hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with
pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation
framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces
answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In
structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated
lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error
composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and
reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser
but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can
decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity
risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators,
per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral
phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting,
confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark
gains reflect deployable capability.

*Prosenjit Biswas,Pervez Shaik,Abhinav Thorat,Ravi Kolla,Niranjan Pedanekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PULSE is a framework that uses Small Language Models (SLMs) to generate rationales as direct learning signals for recommendation systems, creating a "Thought Space" that jointly models user actions and their semantic drivers, outperforming traditional methods while being more efficient than LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have high inference costs for real-world deployment, while SLMs' reasoning capabilities for recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems fail to fully leverage natural language rationales as learning signals, treating them only as descriptive text rather than direct supervision.

Method: PULSE treats SLM-generated rationales as first-class learning signals, supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions (what) and semantic drivers (why). It creates a "Thought Space" that captures common understanding of users and items across domains.

Result: PULSE outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering, and LLM-based sequential recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. It shows superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and strong performance on reasoning-oriented question answering tasks.

Conclusion: By treating rationales as direct learning signals rather than just descriptive text, PULSE demonstrates that SLMs can achieve robust and generalizable recommendation performance while being more efficient than LLM-based approaches, with strong cross-domain transfer capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and
demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented
question answering. Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ExPO-HM is a new method for hateful meme detection that combines explanation generation with detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance by addressing limitations in existing explain-then-detect approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hateful meme detection systems provide only binary predictions without explanations, which is insufficient for real-world moderation. Recent explain-then-detect approaches underperform simple baselines and fail to capture policy-relevant cues.

Method: ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for reasoning quality, inspired by human annotator training processes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three hateful meme benchmarks with up to 15% and 17% F1 improvement over GRPO and DPO baselines, excelling in binary detection, fine-grained classification, and reasoning quality.

Conclusion: ExPO-HM successfully moves hateful meme detection from simple binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, providing accurate, interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online
abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior
approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such
models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation
requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought
prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even
advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis
identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such
as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely
explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.
To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy
Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation
process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum
learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for
reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification,
and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO
and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple
binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate,
interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HDLM is a novel hierarchical discrete diffusion model for language modeling that uses a structured vocabulary with coarse-to-fine semantics, enabling progressive semantic refinement during generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more effective discrete diffusion model for language that leverages hierarchical semantic structure rather than treating all tokens equally, enabling better control over the generation process.

Method: Uses a hierarchical vocabulary mapping detailed semantics to coarse-grained meanings, with forward process perturbing tokens to higher-level ancestors and reverse process progressively predicting more detailed semantics. Includes closed-form ELBO derivation and practical training techniques.

Result: HDLM demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative perplexity than baselines in extensive text generation experiments, showing improved performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: HDLM provides an effective hierarchical diffusion framework for language modeling that generalizes existing approaches and offers superior generation quality through its time-varying semantic scale prediction process.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UCoT is an efficient reasoning framework that uses upfront thought embeddings to compress Chain-of-Thought reasoning, reducing computational costs while maintaining reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long Chain-of-Thought reasoning in LLMs suffers from high computational costs and latency due to autoregressive generation. Existing CoT compression methods either require laborious prompt engineering or sacrifice key reasoning details.

Method: UCoT uses a cooperative workflow with a small model (compressor) and large model (executor). The compressor generates upfront thought embeddings rich in reasoning information, then the executor uses these embeddings to derive answers with short reasoning using a reward mechanism.

Result: UCoT significantly reduces CoT length while maintaining reasoning ability. On GSM8K dataset, it reduces token usage by 50% and achieves 3.08% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when applied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

Conclusion: UCoT provides an effective automated approach for CoT compression that maintains reasoning quality while substantially improving efficiency, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high
computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive
nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the
reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning
efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of
external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this
work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with
upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative
workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The
first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings
rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of
manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize
upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning,
using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the
powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length
of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by
50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

TL;DR: A framework for analyzing style in personal narratives by formalizing linguistic choices as patterns, integrating functional linguistics, computer science, and psychology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of formal framework for systematically analyzing stylistic choices in personal narratives, which are fundamental to conveying subjective experiences.

Method: Uses language models to automatically extract linguistic features (processes, participants, circumstances) and analyzes sequential patterns, integrating functional linguistics, computer science, and psychology.

Result: Applied to hundreds of dream narratives, including a war veteran with PTSD case study, revealing distinctive patterns where verbal processes dominate over mental ones.

Conclusion: The framework successfully illustrates the relationship between linguistic choices and psychological states, providing systematic analysis of narrative style.

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional psychological assessments rely on structured rating scales that miss the nuance of natural language, while LLMs offer potential to harness qualitative data but face bottlenecks in pre-labeled data and expert rubrics.

Method: Developed a framework combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale items, tested on real-world student data (n=693) and synthetic data (n=3,000), empirically selecting LLM scoring instructions based on item information calculations.

Result: Augmented tests achieved statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy, with LLM items providing information gain equivalent to adding 6.3-16.0 items to the original 19-item test.

Conclusion: The framework represents a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses typical bottlenecks and provides a scalable approach for enhancing traditional psychometric measures using transcribed text.

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

### [29] [dInfer: An Efficient Inference Framework for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08666)
*Yuxin Ma,Lun Du,Lanning Wei,Kun Chen,Qian Xu,Kangyu Wang,Guofeng Feng,Guoshan Lu,Lin Liu,Xiaojing Qi,Xinyuan Zhang,Zhen Tao,Haibo Feng,Ziyun Jiang,Ying Xu,Zenan Huang,Yihong Zhuang,Haokai Xu,Jiaqi Hu,Zhenzhong Lan,Junbo Zhao,Jianguo Li,Da Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: dInfer is an efficient inference framework for diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) that achieves 10x speedup over prior systems and 2-3x speedup over optimized autoregressive models while maintaining output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based LLMs offer inherent parallelism advantages over autoregressive LLMs, but their adoption is limited by the lack of standardized and efficient inference frameworks.

Method: dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components (model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, KV-cache manager) with novel algorithms and system-level optimizations.

Result: Achieves over 1,100 tokens/sec on HumanEval and averages 800+ tokens/sec across six benchmarks on 8×H800 GPUs, with 10x speedup over Fast-dLLM and 2-3x speedup over optimized AR models like QWen2.5-3B.

Conclusion: dInfer provides an efficient and extensible framework that enables practical deployment of dLLMs, demonstrating significant performance advantages over both existing dLLM systems and optimized AR models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at
https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

### [30] [Scaling Laws for Code: A More Data-Hungry Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08702)
*Xianzhen Luo,Wenzhen Zheng,Qingfu Zhu,Rongyi Zhang,Houyi Li,Siming Huang,YuanTao Fan,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First large-scale study of scaling laws for Code LLMs, showing code requires higher data-to-parameter ratio than natural language and follows the more expressive Farseer law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling laws for efficient training are mainly studied on natural language, but fundamental differences like strict syntax between code and NL make it unclear if these laws apply to code LLMs.

Method: Conducted 117 experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from 2B to 128B, fitting both Chinchilla law and Farseer law to analyze scaling behavior.

Result: Code LLMs scale effectively with model size but require substantially higher data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Farseer law offers greater accuracy than Chinchilla law for code. Code-NL mixtures help in resource-constrained scenarios but become detrimental at higher compute budgets.

Conclusion: Code represents a more data-hungry regime than natural language, requiring different scaling strategies. The Farseer law provides better modeling of code scaling behavior, and careful consideration of code-NL mixture ratios is needed based on compute constraints.

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering.
However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly
analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like
strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are
directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117
experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from
2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results
show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the
analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially,
code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher
data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on
code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but
becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

### [31] [Thinking Longer, Not Always Smarter: Evaluating LLM Capabilities in Hierarchical Legal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08710)
*Li Zhang,Matthias Grabmair,Morgan Gray,Kevin Ashley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a formal framework for evaluating LLMs' case-based reasoning in legal contexts, revealing a paradox where models perform well on surface-level tasks but struggle with hierarchical and integrated reasoning despite using more computational resources for incorrect answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate LLMs' proficiency in complex case-based reasoning, which is crucial for legal practice but remains underexplored, and to develop a systematic methodology for evaluating nuanced legal reasoning capabilities.

Method: A three-stage reasoning framework that decomposes case distinction identification: modeling cases with factual predicates (factors), organizing them into legal knowledge hierarchy, and defining verifiable rules for distinction analysis and significance evaluation.

Result: LLMs show high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1) but performance degrades on hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Models consistently use more computational resources for incorrect responses.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have fundamental limitations in complex legal reasoning, where 'thinking longer' doesn't equate to 'thinking smarter,' highlighting the need for addressing these limitations for robust and trustworthy legal AI systems.

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring
professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and
distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form
of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that
decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases
into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual
predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and
defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their
argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive
evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve
high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on
hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated
analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models
consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than
correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking
smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM
reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations
that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TC-Bench, a compact and diverse benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated test cases, addressing issues of computational cost, score inflation, and bias in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM-generated test cases suffer from high computational costs, score inflation, and bias towards trivial bugs over rare critical faults.

Method: The authors formalize benchmark construction as finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix, and propose WrongSelect - an efficient approximation algorithm to select maximally diverse wrong codes.

Result: TC-Bench shows that even the most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled approach to benchmark construction with minimal sets of wrong codes and test cases, offering better fault coverage and resistance to score inflation.

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high
computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over
rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What
is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error
space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish
them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as
finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of
this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong
codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required
for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal
to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard
problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select
maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of
competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse,
and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the
most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on
TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power. Our dataset is

### [33] [How Reliable is Language Model Micro-Benchmarking?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08730)
*Gregory Yauney,Shahzaib Saqib Warraich,Swabha Swayamdipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Micro-benchmarking using small subsets of benchmarks often fails to rank models consistently, requiring 250+ examples for reliable comparisons when models have small performance differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether micro-benchmarks can rank language models as consistently as full benchmarks and whether they outperform random subset selection.

Method: Introduced a meta-evaluation measure that assesses how well micro-benchmarks rank model pairs based on their performance difference on full benchmarks, analyzing trade-offs between size and reliability.

Result: Found that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs with 3.5-4 point accuracy differences on MMLU-Pro and BIG-bench Hard. Requires 250+ examples for reliable comparisons of similar models, where random sampling becomes competitive.

Conclusion: Micro-benchmarking has significant reliability limitations, especially for small subsets, and provides guidance for balancing evaluation efficiency with reliability.

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geocoding is essential for analyzing unstructured text, but compositional location references present a challenging setting that requires advanced reasoning.

Method: Evaluated LLMs' geospatial knowledge vs reasoning skills, then proposed an LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references.

Result: The approach improves performance for the task and shows that relatively small fine-tuned LLMs can achieve comparable performance with much larger off-the-shelf models.

Conclusion: LLM-based strategies are effective for geocoding compositional location references, with fine-tuned smaller models offering comparable performance to larger models.

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic
location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In
this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional
location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to
reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus
reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

TL;DR: Evaluation of frontier and open-source LLMs across five dimensions in multilingual contexts shows GPT-5 performs best overall, while other models display inconsistency across languages and categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries and languages, there's a need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses across various dimensions.

Method: Evaluated responses of frontier and leading open-source models across five dimensions using low and high-resource languages, employing a five-point grading rubric and judge LLM for assessment.

Result: GPT-5 performed best on average in each category, while other models showed inconsistency. In Consent & Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored highest (3.56 and 4.73) while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored lowest (1.39 and 1.98).

Conclusion: Findings emphasize the need for further testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across categories and improvements in these areas.

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further

*S M Rafiuddin,Muntaha Nujat Khan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adaptive Retention is a token selection method that reduces Transformer memory usage by 35-45% and improves throughput by up to 1.8x while maintaining 95% performance by keeping only 30-50% of tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length (O(n²)), which limits practical use for long-context applications.

Method: Probabilistic, layer-wise token selection using Bernoulli gates trained via Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation, with top-M rule at inference for strict global budget.

Result: Across classification, QA, and summarization tasks, keeping 30-50% tokens preserves ≥95% performance while reducing memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by ~1.8x.

Conclusion: This architecture-agnostic approach enables practical long-context efficiency without modifying base attention mechanisms or task heads.

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2),
limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic,
layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep
under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates
trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple
top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for
standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document
summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model
performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up
to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context
efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in general Chinese-language contexts and bridge the gap in assessing their ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step reasoning.

Method: Constructed a domain-balanced seed set from existing QA datasets, developed an LLM-powered pipeline to generate multi-hop questions based on factual unit chains, and implemented a human-in-the-loop verification system with domain experts to validate and refine questions.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs revealed persistent limitations in processing long-tail knowledge and executing knowledge-intensive reasoning. Retrieval-augmented generation substantially mitigated these knowledge gaps with significant performance gains.

Conclusion: The CCMOR benchmark effectively exposes LLMs' limitations in Chinese commonsense multi-hop reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation shows promise in addressing knowledge gaps for improved performance.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

TL;DR: MOSAIC is a multi-agent LLM framework for scientific coding that uses specialized agents in a student-teacher paradigm to solve complex scientific problems through stepwise decomposition and targeted error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific coding requires rigorous algorithms with deep domain knowledge, domain-specific reasoning, and algorithm iteration without I/O test cases. Many scientific problems involve sequences of subproblems that need to be solved.

Method: Training-free multi-agent framework with specialized agents that self-reflect, create rationale, code, and debug within a student-teacher paradigm. Uses Consolidated Context Window (CCW) to mitigate LLM hallucinations.

Result: MOSAIC outperforms existing approaches on scientific coding benchmarks in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The specialized agentic framework effectively addresses challenges in scientific code generation through stepwise problem decomposition and targeted error correction.

Abstract: We present MOSAIC, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework for
solving challenging scientific coding tasks. Unlike general-purpose coding,
scientific workflows require algorithms that are rigorous, interconnected with
deep domain knowledge, and incorporate domain-specific reasoning, as well as
algorithm iteration without requiring I/O test cases. Many scientific problems
also require a sequence of subproblems to be solved, leading to the final
desired result. MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially
designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a
student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code
generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted
error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window
(CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks
involving chained subproblems. We evaluate MOSAIC on scientific coding
benchmarks and demonstrate that our specialized agentic framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in multilingual LLMs, finding that privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization granularity across English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly deployed in multilingual applications handling sensitive data, but privacy risks are mostly evaluated for English. The paper aims to understand how language structure affects privacy leakage across different languages.

Method: Quantified six linguistic indicators and evaluated three attack vectors (extraction, counterfactual memorization, membership inference) on LLMs trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora.

Result: Italian exhibited the strongest privacy leakage, English showed higher membership separability, while French and Spanish displayed greater resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization granularity.

Conclusion: Language structure significantly impacts privacy leakage in LLMs, with the first quantitative evidence showing that language matters in privacy risks, highlighting the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms in LLM deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual

granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher
membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater
resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings
provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy

*Jia Ao Sun,Hao Yu,Fabrizio Gotti,Fengran Mo,Yihong Wu,Yuchen Hui,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Search-on-Graph (SoG) is a framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative graph navigation on knowledge graphs for question answering, achieving state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive multi-hop questions due to missing facts, hallucinations, and outdated knowledge, while existing KGQA methods face trade-offs between query brittleness, noise from large subgraphs, and exponential search spaces in agent frameworks.

Method: SoG uses a single Search function for iterative "observe-then-navigate" graph traversal - at each step, the LLM examines available relations from the current entity before deciding the next hop, adapting to different KG schemas and handling high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering.

Result: Across six KGQA benchmarks on Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly strong gains on Wikidata (+16% improvement over previous best methods) and consistent improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

Conclusion: The simple yet effective SoG framework demonstrates that iterative informed graph navigation outperforms complex pre-planning or retrieval approaches for knowledge graph question answering.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
yet remain unreliable on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions -- they miss
long-tail facts, hallucinate when uncertain, and their internal knowledge lags
behind real-world change. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of
relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs:
compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves
brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent
frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To
address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph
navigation using a single, carefully designed \textsc{Search} function. Rather
than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an
``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual
available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop.
This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles
high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks
spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance
without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata
benchmarks (+16\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent
improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PE-CoA is a framework using five conversation patterns to create effective multi-turn jailbreaks that bypass LLM safety constraints, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 12 models and 10 harm categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods rely on heuristic strategies and provide limited insight into model vulnerabilities, with poor understanding of how conversation patterns relate to weaknesses across different harm categories.

Method: Proposed Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA) framework with five conversation patterns to construct multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue, evaluated on twelve LLMs across ten harm categories.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance, uncovered pattern-specific vulnerabilities and LLM behavioral characteristics: models have distinct weakness profiles, robustness to one pattern doesn't generalize to others, and model families share similar failure modes.

Conclusion: Findings highlight limitations of current safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware defenses to address specific conversational vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While quality estimation reranking is effective at sentence level, its application to document-level translation remains underexplored despite the growing importance of document-level MT.

Method: Evaluated QE reranking performance on document-level translation using various learned metrics (SLIDE) and LLM-based metrics (GEMBA-DA) with different numbers of translation candidates (2 to 32).

Result: With SLIDE metric, BLEURT-20 improved by +2.00 with 2 candidates and +5.09 with 32 candidates. Using GEMBA-DA, gains were +1.63 and +4.30 respectively. Gains were smaller but still positive (+2.34 and +1.40) on longest documents (512-1024 tokens).

Conclusion: Document-level QE reranking provides practical value with minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating effectiveness across both decoder-only LLM and encoder-decoder NMT models.

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which
aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best
candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at
the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of
document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE
reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical
sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model
(LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE,
BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with
32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine
translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of
+1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink
with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34
(SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens).
These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with
minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

*Yan Wang,Keyi Wang,Shanshan Yang,Jaisal Patel,Jeff Zhao,Fengran Mo,Xueqing Peng,Lingfei Qian,Jimin Huang,Guojun Xiong,Xiao-Yang Liu,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinAuditing is the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on financial auditing tasks using real XBRL filings, revealing significant limitations in structured financial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial auditing is difficult to automate due to GAAP complexity and XBRL hierarchical structure, and LLMs' capabilities in structured financial document reasoning remain unexplored.

Method: Created FinAuditing benchmark from real US-GAAP XBRL filings with three subtasks: FinSM (semantic consistency), FinRE (relational consistency), FinMR (numerical consistency), plus unified evaluation framework.

Result: Zero-shot experiments on 13 LLMs show inconsistent performance across semantic, relational, and mathematical dimensions, with 60-90% accuracy drops on hierarchical multi-document structures.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have systematic limitations in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning, and FinAuditing provides foundation for developing trustworthy financial intelligence systems.

Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the
hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings
make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,
interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first
taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs
on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,
FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic
consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical
consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.
We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,
classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive
zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models
perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical
dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over
hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic
limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and
establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,
structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The
benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

*Haomin Zhuang,Yujun Zhou,Taicheng Guo,Yue Huang,Fangxu Liu,Kai Song,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method that applies different temperature settings to reasoning vs knowledge tokens in LLMs to enhance reasoning performance through targeted exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior RL approaches for LLMs don't explicitly encourage exploration during token generation, and tokens play distinct roles (reasoning vs knowledge) that should be treated differently.

Method: Apply higher temperatures to reasoning tokens to encourage exploration, while keeping lower temperatures for knowledge tokens to maintain factual correctness. Investigate various multi-temperature scheduling strategies.

Result: Empirical evaluations on reasoning benchmarks show significant improvement in LLM reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Explicitly promoting exploration through multi-temperature sampling for different token types effectively enhances reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified Biomedical Named Entity Recognition framework using LLMs that handles nested entities through symbolic tagging, achieves multilingual generalization via bilingual joint fine-tuning, and improves prediction quality with contrastive learning-based entity selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BioNER methods struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual generalization, limiting their effectiveness in medical information extraction.

Method: Reformulate BioNER as text generation with symbolic tagging for flat/nested entities, perform bilingual joint fine-tuning across Chinese/English datasets, and use contrastive learning-based entity selector with boundary-sensitive samples.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets and robust zero-shot generalization across languages on two unseen corpora.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key challenges in BioNER and demonstrates strong cross-lingual generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source

TL;DR: SAC is a novel context compression method that directly selects anchor tokens from original context and aggregates contextual information into their KV representations, eliminating the need for autoencoding training and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current context compression methods rely on autoencoding tasks, creating a mismatch between reconstruction optimization and actual downstream tasks, weakening features beneficial for real-world usage.

Method: SAC directly selects anchor tokens from original context and aggregates contextual information into their KV representations using anchor embeddings and bidirectional attention modification, eliminating autoencoding training.

Result: SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios, achieving 1 EM improvement at 5x compression on MRQA with increasing advantages at higher compression ratios.

Conclusion: SAC provides a more effective approach to context compression by directly leveraging contextual tokens rather than relying on autoencoding tasks, demonstrating superior performance across different compression scenarios.

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large
language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact
representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on
autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress
contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to
acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a
fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge
from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial
for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel
method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture
that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of
training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly
selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates
contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving
representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need
for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly
leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor
embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)
bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture
information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC
consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various
compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves
1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing
advantages at higher compression ratios.

*Nicholas Deas,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs develop artificial impressions in their internal representations that resemble human stereotypes, which can be decoded using linear probes and predict model behavior like response quality and hedging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs form human-like impressions and stereotypes in their internal representations, and how these artificial impressions influence downstream model behavior.

Method: Used linear probes on generated prompts to predict impressions according to the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), analyzing the relationship between impressions and model behavior as well as prompt features.

Result: Found that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted directly, but impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from hidden representations. Artificial impressions predict response quality and hedging use, and are influenced by content, stylistic, and dialectal features in prompts.

Conclusion: LLMs develop artificial impressions that resemble human stereotypes, which are detectable in internal representations and influence model outputs, highlighting the need to understand and potentially mitigate these biases.

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal
representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes
based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict
impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM).
Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and
downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such
impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted,
but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their
hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of
prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We
also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in
prompts impact LLM impressions.

*Jiaming Wang,Zhe Tang,Yilin Jin,Peng Ding,Xiaoyu Li,Xuezhi Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SOP-Maze is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on complex standard operating procedures (SOPs) from real business scenarios, revealing key limitations in procedural reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks don't adequately evaluate LLMs' ability to handle complex business SOPs, which involve intricate procedures and decision-making in real-world scenarios.

Method: Created SOP-Maze benchmark with 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP scenarios, categorized into Lateral Root System (wide-option selection) and Heart Root System (deep logical reasoning with complex branches).

Result: Most state-of-the-art models struggle with SOP-Maze, with three main error types: route blindness (procedure following), conversational fragility (dialogue handling), and calculation errors (time/arithmetic reasoning).

Conclusion: The study provides new insights for improving LLM capabilities in complex procedural tasks and has been open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific
agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow
instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business
scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the
evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To
bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world
business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP
scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root
System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and
Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex
branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models
struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three
key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures;
(ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and
(iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under
complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP
tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for
improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how open source communities describe participation and control through governance documents and establish a baseline for evaluating AI-mediated workflows' impact on authority distribution.

Method: Analyzed 710 projects with paired snapshots, parsed text into actors, rules, actions, and objects, then measured change using entropy (evenness), richness (diversity), and Jensen Shannon divergence (drift).

Result: Projects define more roles and actions over time with more even distribution, while rule composition remains stable. Governance grows by expanding and balancing participation categories without major shifts in prescriptive force.

Conclusion: The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for evaluating whether future AI-mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute authority in open source communities.

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control
through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects
with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects,
then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for
diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles
and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the
composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major
shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for
evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DARO introduces dynamic difficulty-aware reweighting for RLVR methods to address limitations of static weighting schemes in existing approaches like GRPO, achieving superior performance on math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods like GRPO and its variants use static weighting schemes tied to sample difficulty, which prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities and creates loss scale issues that hinder overall performance.

Method: DARO (Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization) dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the model's learning state, rather than using static or simplistic weighting schemes.

Result: Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show DARO outperforms four leading baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster convergence and superior final performance.

Conclusion: DARO provides a more effective approach for RLVR by dynamically adapting to model capabilities, addressing fundamental limitations in existing methods and enabling better overall performance on reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning
ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has
emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants.
However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally
weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that
their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample
difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates
a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on
certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that
dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the
model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading
baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster

TL;DR: LoRA-based refusal training enables performance-preserving safety alignment using only safety data, serving as cost-efficient safety patches that decouple safety into a low-rank subspace orthogonal to the model's intrinsic capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety alignment methods require expensive searches for optimal data proportions to balance safety and general performance, incurring high costs with limited gains.

Method: LoRA-based refusal training that trains solely on safety data, leveraging LoRA's ability to decouple safety into a low-rank subspace orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space.

Result: Enables performance-preserving safety alignment without degrading general model capabilities, providing cost-efficient and plug-and-play safety patches.

Conclusion: LoRA effectively separates safety enhancements from inherent model capabilities, ensuring safety improvements don't interfere with general performance while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial
intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without
degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally
expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and
general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high
costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based
Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when
trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as
cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches.
Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental
evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace
largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that
safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

Motivation: LLM performance in essay scoring is highly sensitive to prompts, and existing rubrics may not be optimally aligned with human evaluations. The study aims to enhance AES by improving the scoring rubrics through iterative refinement.

Method: The approach prompts LLMs to iteratively refine scoring rubrics by reflecting on their own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on sample essays. Experiments were conducted on TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning multilingual transformer models on a novel Bangla-transliterated Chakma corpus significantly improves performance for this low-resource Indo-Aryan language, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and 2.90 perplexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chakma is an under-resourced Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, making it underrepresented in language models. The research aims to address this gap by creating resources for Chakma language processing.

Method: Created a manually validated corpus from Chakma literature using Bangla transliteration, then fine-tuned six transformer models (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, IndicBERT) on masked language modeling tasks.

Result: Fine-tuned multilingual models outperformed pre-trained counterparts, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and perplexity as low as 2.90. Analysis showed data quality significantly impacts performance and revealed OCR limitations for Indic scripts.

Conclusion: Bangla-transliterated Chakma is effective for transfer learning, and the research demonstrates the importance of high-quality datasets for low-resource language modeling. The manually validated dataset is released to encourage further research.

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely
underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus
of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma

six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT,
XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked

multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to
Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a
perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data
quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for
morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that
Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for

*Chi Seng Cheang,Hou Pong Chan,Wenxuan Zhang,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs don't encode truthfulness in internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall, making some hallucinations indistinguishable from correct responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs' internal computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs, given that LLMs encode factuality signals but also produce factual errors.

Method: Conducted mechanistic analysis comparing two types of hallucinations based on their reliance on subject information, examining internal recall processes and hidden-state geometries.

Result: Hallucinations associated with subject knowledge use same internal recall process as correct responses with overlapping hidden-state geometries, while hallucinations detached from subject knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that are detectable.

Conclusion: LLMs don't encode truthfulness in internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall, demonstrating that 'LLMs don't really know what they don't know'.

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality
signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention
weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't
know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or
spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective
that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal
computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.
In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process
factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their
reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are
associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process
as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable
hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject
knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them
detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode
truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,
demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

*Muhammad Ali Shafique,Kanwal Mehreen,Muhammad Arham,Maaz Amjad,Sabur Butt,Hamza Farooq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct is a multilingual Urdu-English LLM trained on high-quality synthetic data using a modified self-instruct technique, achieving superior performance on Urdu tasks with under $100 training budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in developing LLMs for low-resource languages like Urdu, including scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety concerns, while avoiding costly and culturally-insensitive translation approaches.

Method: Modified self-instruct technique using unique prompts and seed values for each task with a global task pool, creating Urdu-Instruct dataset with Urdu-native chain-of-thought reasoning, bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments.

Result: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on Urdu-specific tasks and beats leading multilingual LLMs (Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B) with under $100 training budget.

Conclusion: High-performance, culturally-aligned LLMs for low-resource languages can be developed efficiently using modified self-instruct approaches, demonstrating cost-effective solutions for language-specific AI development.

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

### [59] [ReFIne: A Framework for Trustworthy Large Reasoning Models with Reliability, Faithfulness, and Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09062)
*Chung-En Sun,Ge Yan,Akshay Kulkarni,Tsui-Wei Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReFIne is a training framework that improves reasoning model trustworthiness through better interpretability, faithfulness, and reliability, without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current long chain-of-thought reasoning systems prioritize accuracy and efficiency but overlook critical trustworthiness aspects like interpretability, faithfulness, and reliability.

Method: Propose ReFIne framework combining supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to produce structured reasoning traces with planning, explicit disclosure of decisive information, and self-assessments of derivation soundness and answer confidence.

Result: ReFIne models show significant improvements: interpretability +44.0%, faithfulness +18.8%, reliability +42.4% across mathematical benchmarks, while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: Reasoning models should be optimized for broader trustworthiness dimensions beyond just accuracy, and ReFIne demonstrates effective training for trustworthy reasoning systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely
prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects
critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be
trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness,
and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve
interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level
planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by
explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with
consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing
self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the
final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales
(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.
Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and
better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully
expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer
informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight
an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not
only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness. Our code

### [60] [FrameEOL: Semantic Frame Induction using Causal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09097)
*Chihiro Yano,Kosuke Yamada,Hayato Tsukagoshi,Ryohei Sasano,Koichi Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes FrameEOL, a CLM-based method for semantic frame induction using prompt-based embeddings with ICL and DML, achieving state-of-the-art performance on English and Japanese FrameNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLMs like GPT and Llama succeed in language tasks but haven't been applied to semantic frame induction, while MLMs have shown good performance. The authors want to leverage CLMs' capabilities for this task.

Method: FrameEOL uses prompt-based embeddings that output frame names as labels. Combines in-context learning (ICL) with deep metric learning (DML) to get better embeddings, then performs clustering.

Result: Outperforms existing frame induction methods on English and Japanese FrameNet. For Japanese with limited resources, CLM with only 5 ICL examples matches MLM fine-tuned with DML.

Conclusion: CLMs can be effectively applied to semantic frame induction, especially for low-resource languages where they achieve competitive performance with minimal examples.

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words
according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging
embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language
models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame
induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama
series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage
in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to
semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction
based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for
obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing
the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we
leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame
induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.
Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate
that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In
particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based
method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the
MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

### [61] [When Retrieval Succeeds and Fails: Rethinking Retrieval-Augmented Generation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09106)
*Yongjie Wang,Yue Yu,Kaisong Song,Jun Lin,Zhiqi Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), analyzing its objectives, components, challenges, and applications where RAG enhances LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with rapidly evolving information and domain-specific queries due to training on static corpora, necessitating external knowledge integration through RAG.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic review of RAG frameworks, analyzing their core components, identifying key challenges and limitations, and evaluating applications where RAG improves LLM effectiveness.

Result: The review highlights critical weaknesses in traditional RAG frameworks and demonstrates that RAG can substantially enhance LLM performance in scenarios where LLMs alone perform inadequately.

Conclusion: The work aims to encourage reconsideration of RAG's role and inspire development of next-generation RAG systems to better address LLM limitations in handling dynamic and specialized information.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications
through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation.
However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in
addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation
by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access
up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves
continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of
traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we
present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching
objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG,
highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we
showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG,
when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope
this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire
the development of next-generation RAG systems.

*Enze Zhang,Jiaying Wang,Mengxi Xiao,Jifei Liu,Ziyan Kuang,Rui Dong,Youzhong Dong,Sophia Ananiadou,Min Peng,Qianqian Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DITING is the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation, assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions using 18K+ expert-annotated Chinese-English pairs. AgentEval, a multi-agent framework, achieves the highest correlation with human judgments among automatic metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MT benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture distinctive traits of web novel genre, and LLM effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.

Method: Introduced DITING framework with six evaluation dimensions, developed AgentEval (reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation), and MetricAlign (meta-evaluation dataset with 300 annotated pairs). Evaluated 14 open, closed, and commercial models.

Result: Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts. DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent translations. AgentEval achieves highest correlation with human judgments among seven automatic metrics.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research in this domain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation
(MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.
Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the
distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING,
the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation,
assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom
translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency,
zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K
expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval,
a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert
deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving
the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic
metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation
dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality
scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial
models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts,
and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent
translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web
novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

### [63] [Augmenting Dialog with Think-Aloud Utterances for Modeling Individual Personality Traits by LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09158)
*Seiya Ishikura,Hiroaki Yamada,Tatsuya Hiraoka,Hiroaki Yamada,Takenobu Tokunaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances improves LLM's ability to model individual personalities, particularly Agreeableness and Neuroticism traits from the Big Five framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance personality modeling in text chat by LLMs through think-aloud utterances that capture speakers' internal thoughts before articulation.

Method: Training persona LLMs with TAU-augmented dialog data and evaluating personality alignment using the Big Five framework.

Result: LLMs trained with TAU-augmented data showed better alignment with speakers' Agreeableness and Neuroticism traits compared to those trained with original dialog data.

Conclusion: Think-aloud utterance augmentation effectively improves personality modeling in LLMs, with performance dependent on the quality of TAU augmentation.

Abstract: This study proposes augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs)
for modeling individual personalities in text chat by LLM. TAU is a
verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We
expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's
personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the
human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human
personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with
TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and
Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also
found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

### [64] [Stronger Re-identification Attacks through Reasoning and Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09184)
*Lucas Georges Gabriel Charpentier,Pierre Lison*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents two strategies to improve re-identification attacks on de-identified text: (1) aggregating predictions across multiple orderings of PII spans, and (2) using reasoning models when extensive background knowledge is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for measuring the effectiveness of text de-identification are limited. Re-identification attacks can better assess de-identification robustness by attempting to uncover masked personally identifiable information (PII) using background knowledge.

Method: Two complementary strategies: (1) exploring how the order of re-identifying PII spans affects results and aggregating predictions across multiple orderings, and (2) employing reasoning models that leverage extensive background knowledge to boost re-identification performance.

Result: The proposed strategies lead to stronger re-identification attacks, with improved results from aggregating predictions across multiple orderings and enhanced performance from reasoning models when background knowledge is available.

Conclusion: These two strategies provide more robust methods for evaluating text de-identification techniques by building stronger re-identification attacks that better measure the ability of de-identification methods to conceal personal identities.

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally
identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the
identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure.
Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be
assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an
automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that
have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build
stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which
the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions
across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2)
reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when
the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

TL;DR: Qwen3-XPlus models use layer-selective tuning on parallel data to enhance translation while maintaining reasoning capabilities, achieving significant improvements in multilingual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General LLMs excel at reasoning but translation-enhanced models struggle with reasoning tasks. There's a need for models that can handle both translation and reasoning effectively.

Method: Proposed a translation-enhanced recipe starting with instruct models and applying layer-selective tuning only on parallel data, using small parallel datasets for training.

Result: Achieved 15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages like Swahili, with 1+ point average improvement on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining reasoning proficiency comparable to Qwen3 instruct model.

Conclusion: This approach offers a promising method for multilingual enhancement that reduces complexity and improves accessibility for various languages.

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced
for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a
novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies
layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we
introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in
translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving
15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili.
Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves
an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining
proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning
datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement,
significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range
of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

*Yiqi Li,Yusheng Liao,Zhe Chen,Yanfeng Wang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DICE is a lightweight framework that uses small language models to refine LLM outputs through chain-of-thought correction, improving format accuracy by 35.4% and content correctness by 29.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often prioritize reasoning over adhering to strict output formats, and fine-tuning them is impractical due to high computational costs and limited parameter access.

Method: DICE decouples the process by having LLMs generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs to analyze and refine outputs through chain-of-thought correction. It constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and applies dual-tuning strategy for SLMs.

Result: Experiments show DICE improves format accuracy by 35.4% and content correctness by 29.4%, achieving state-of-the-art performance over competitive baselines.

Conclusion: DICE effectively preserves LLMs' knowledge and reasoning capabilities while ensuring outputs conform to user-specific structured requirements through lightweight SLM-based refinement.

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IRIS is a novel framework for real-time causal discovery that combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover both known and novel causal relations from initial variables, automatically collecting documents and identifying missing variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery methods face challenges like expensive data collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic assumptions. LLM-based methods excel at known relations but fail to uncover novel ones.

Method: IRIS uses a hybrid approach combining statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods. It starts with initial variables, automatically collects relevant documents, extracts variables, uncovers causal relations, and includes a missing variable proposal component to expand causal graphs.

Result: The framework enables real-time causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring pre-existing datasets, addressing limitations of both traditional statistical methods and recent LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: IRIS provides a comprehensive solution for causal discovery that overcomes key limitations of existing methods by integrating statistical and LLM-based approaches, enabling discovery of both known and novel causal relations in real-time.

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

*Giacomo Gonella,Gian Maria Campedelli,Stefano Menini,Marco Guerini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrisiText is the first large-scale dataset for generating warning messages across 13 crisis scenarios, containing over 400,000 messages for 18,000 crisis situations, with experiments comparing various NLG approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI assistance in emergencies focuses mainly on classification tasks, overlooking the significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG architectures for crisis situations like natural disasters or violent attacks.

Method: Created CrisiText dataset by starting from existing crisis descriptions, building chains of events, and pairing each event with expert-guided warning messages. Compared supervised fine-tuning with preference alignment, zero-shot, few-shot approaches, out-of-distribution scenarios, and automatic post-editing.

Result: Developed a comprehensive dataset of 400,000+ warning messages spanning 18,000 crisis situations across 13 disaster types, with each message accompanied by three suboptimal warning types for comparative NLG studies.

Conclusion: The paper establishes CrisiText as a foundational resource for crisis warning message generation research and demonstrates the viability of various NLG approaches for this critical application domain.

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing
supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and
few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic
post-editor.

*Chenyang Gu,Yewen Pu,Bruce Yang,Xiaofan Li,Huan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSPO is an RL algorithm that trains LLMs to actively search external knowledge through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample filtering, achieving significant performance improvements on QA benchmarks without supervised data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for enhancing LLMs with external knowledge search either rely on prompting or suffer from performance limitations and training instability when applying RL to complex interactive tasks.

Method: Dynamic-filter Sequence-level Policy Optimization (DSPO) - an RL algorithm using sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample filtering to train models to interleave multi-turn search and reasoning without supervised demonstration data.

Result: DSPO-trained 7B model improves over comparable previous work by 34.1% across multiple QA benchmarks, outperforms previous 14B model by nearly 9% relative on HotpotQA, and maintains exceptional training stability.

Conclusion: DSPO enables robust agent training for LLMs to actively search external knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex QA tasks while maintaining training stability.

Abstract: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is
crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on
prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from
performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive
tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we
introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust
agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample
filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search
and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across
multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable
previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from
previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\%
relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

*Yongding Tao,Tian Wang,Yihong Dong,Huanyu Liu,Kechi Zhang,Xiaolong Hu,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-Critique is a novel method for detecting data contamination in RL post-training of LLMs by identifying policy collapse through entropy distribution analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data contamination during RL post-training poses a critical threat to LLM evaluation validity, but existing detection methods only cover pre-training and SFT stages, leaving RL phase vulnerable.

Method: Self-Critique probes for policy collapse by analyzing output entropy distribution collapse into sparse modes, and introduces RL-MIA benchmark for RL contamination scenarios.

Result: Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods with up to 30% AUC improvement, making detection possible where existing methods perform close to random guessing.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the critical gap in RL post-training contamination detection and enables reliable evaluation of LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

TL;DR: CFVBench is a new multimodal benchmark for video-based retrieval-augmented generation that addresses limitations in modality coverage and format diversity, revealing current MLLMs' struggles with fine-grained multimodal details and proposing AVR framework to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal retrieval-augmented generation benchmarks are limited in modality coverage and format diversity, often focusing on single-modality tasks or coarse-grained scene understanding, creating a need for more comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

Method: Created CFVBench with 5,360 QA pairs from 599 videos covering diverse formats like chart-heavy reports and software tutorials; evaluated 7 retrieval methods and 14 MLLMs; proposed Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR) framework that adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external tools.

Result: Current MLLMs (including GPT-4 and Gemini) struggle to capture transient fine-grained multimodal details; AVR consistently enhances fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all evaluated MLLMs.

Conclusion: CFVBench reveals critical bottlenecks in current multimodal models, and the proposed AVR framework effectively addresses fine-grained multimodal comprehension challenges, providing a scalable solution for improving video-based MRAG systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal
evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However,
existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity,
often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene
understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale,
manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos,
yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and
domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials,
requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while
maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we
systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing
a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture
transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we
propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that
adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external
tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances
fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all
evaluated MLLMs

*Xiangxu Zhang,Lei Li,Yanyun Zhou,Xiao Zhou,Yingying Zhang,Xian Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DyReMe is a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that generates realistic consultation-like cases with distractors and varied expression styles, evaluating LLMs on accuracy, veracity, helpfulness, and consistency to better align with real clinical practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations in medical diagnostics are misaligned with real-world practice, relying on static benchmarks from public medical exams that overestimate performance and ignore the ambiguity and variability of real clinical cases.

Method: Proposed DyReMe benchmark generates fresh, consultation-like cases with distractors (differential diagnoses, misdiagnosis factors) and varied expression styles, evaluating LLMs on four dimensions: accuracy, veracity, helpfulness, and consistency.

Result: Experiments show DyReMe provides more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing significant misalignments between state-of-the-art LLM performance and real clinical practice requirements.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for evaluation frameworks like DyReMe that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics, as current static benchmarks fail to capture real-world clinical complexity.

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

*Jiuheng Lin,Cong Jiang,Zirui Wu,Jiarui Sun,Yansong Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLARity is a cost-effective RL framework that improves reasoning quality in expert LLMs using small general-purpose LLMs, addressing the limitations of standard outcome-based RL on MCQs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training expert LLMs in data-scarce domains using MCQs with standard RL often degrades reasoning quality like logical consistency, while existing solutions like large-scale PRMs are too expensive.

Method: CLARity integrates consistency-aware reward mechanism with 2-stage refine-then-monitor pipeline and dynamic data reformulation strategy to enhance reasoning consistency and exploit limited data effectively.

Result: CLARity improves response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines, with human evaluations confirming improvements in coherence and professionalism.

Conclusion: CLARity offers a generalizable solution enabling smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency, providing a cost-effective alternative to expensive PRMs.

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying
on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we
observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency.
Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward
Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose
CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using
only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware
reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to
enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to
better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves
response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human
evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and
professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables
smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our

*Kohei Oda,Po-Min Chuang,Kiyoaki Shirai,Natthawut Kertkeidkachorn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DualCSE is a sentence embedding method that assigns two embeddings per sentence - one for explicit semantics and one for implicit semantics - to overcome limitations of single-vector approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional sentence embedding methods struggle to capture implicit semantics because they assign only a single vector per sentence, which is insufficient for representing both explicit and implicit meanings.

Method: Proposes DualCSE which assigns two embeddings to each sentence: one for explicit semantics and another for implicit semantics, coexisting in a shared space to allow selection of desired semantics for different tasks.

Result: Experimental results show DualCSE effectively encodes both explicit and implicit meanings and improves performance on downstream tasks like information retrieval and text classification.

Conclusion: DualCSE successfully overcomes the limitations of single-vector sentence embeddings by capturing both explicit and implicit semantics, leading to improved performance in various applications.

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still
struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be
attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding
methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two
embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the
other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the
shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific
purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental
results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and
implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

*Jiapeng Wang,Changxin Tian,Kunlong Chen,Ziqi Liu,Jiaxin Mao,Wayne Xin Zhao,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MaP is a framework that combines checkpoint merging and Pass@k metric to address instability in LLM evaluation during pre-training, providing smoother performance curves and more reliable model assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation during pre-training suffers from significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics, making it difficult to reliably assess model progress.

Method: MaP uses two complementary techniques: checkpoint merging (averaging recent model weights to smooth parameter space) and Pass@k metric (providing robust statistical estimates of model capability).

Result: Extensive experiments show MaP yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance, and ensures more consistent model rankings.

Conclusion: MaP provides a more reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by
significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we
systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct
sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and
\textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract
both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that
synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the
\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by
averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance
statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP
yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance,
and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more
reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a
crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

TL;DR: ShiZhi is a specialized LLM for criminal court view generation that achieves 58.5 BLEU-1 score and high accuracy on charge prediction using a 110K+ case dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Court View Generation is challenging due to case complexity, and direct generation from raw facts limits performance, requiring domain-specific solutions.

Method: Developed ShiZhi LLM specifically for court view generation, trained on CCVG dataset containing 110K+ Chinese cases with fact descriptions paired with court views.

Result: Achieved 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation and 86.1% accuracy with 92.5% macro F1 on charge prediction, demonstrating small LLMs can generate legally coherent court views.

Conclusion: Domain-specific LLMs trained on high-quality legal data can effectively generate reasonable court views, even with smaller model sizes.

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal
artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View"
section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to
the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw
facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large
language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We
construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K
cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views.
Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation
and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental
results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally
coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our

*Jianuo Huang,Yaojie Zhang,Yicun Yang,Benhao Huang,Biqing Qi,Dongrui Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MaskKV is a training-free cache eviction framework for diffusion large language models that reduces memory usage while maintaining performance through mask-query guided scoring and adaptive cache budgeting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion LLMs have high memory costs due to bidirectional attention cache, limiting their ability to handle long contexts under resource constraints. Existing ARM cache strategies don't work well for dLLMs.

Method: Uses mask-query guided scoring to identify and evict less critical tokens using attention weights, plus adaptive cache budgeting that reduces allocation in intermediate layers and focuses on prompt-preferring heads.

Result: On LLaDA with only 256 KV pairs (less than 5% of tokens), retains 94% of full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length.

Conclusion: MaskKV effectively addresses dLLM memory limitations while maintaining performance, enabling efficient long-context processing under resource constraints.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to
dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at
the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the
cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory
footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under
resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for
ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to
unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a
training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the
effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a
mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to
identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive
cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in
intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On
LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of
tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up
to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV), a white-box method that analyzes structural fingerprints in attribution graphs to verify reasoning correctness and identify computational patterns of errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CoT verification methods (black-box and gray-box) provide limited insight into why computations fail, lacking deeper understanding of reasoning errors.

Method: Train a classifier on structural features of attribution graphs from correct vs incorrect CoT steps, treating them as execution traces of latent reasoning circuits.

Result: Structural signatures of error are highly predictive, domain-specific, and causal - enabling targeted interventions to correct faulty reasoning.

Conclusion: White-box analysis of computational processes enables moving from simple error detection to causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

*Yu-Chen Lu,Chong-Yan Chen,Chi-Chih Chang,Yu-Fang Hu,Kai-Chiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLRC is a fine-grained low-rank compression method that optimizes rank allocation per layer and uses progressive decoding to maintain LLM performance while reducing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current low-rank compression methods use uniform compression ratios across layers, causing performance degradation, and perform poorly during text decoding.

Method: FLRC determines optimal rank allocation for each layer and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text generation quality.

Result: Achieves up to 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods.

Conclusion: FLRC establishes a more robust and efficient framework for improving LLM inference through fine-grained low-rank compression.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLP is an LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product pricing that uses retrieval, two-stage optimization (SFT + GRPO), and confidence filtering to provide accurate price suggestions, significantly outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inexperienced individual sellers on C2C platforms struggle with pricing second-hand products efficiently. Existing static regression models have poor generalization and fail to capture market dynamics like price depreciation over time.

Method: LLP retrieves similar products, uses LLMs to understand pricing information from text, applies two-stage optimization (supervised fine-tuning followed by group relative policy optimization), and employs confidence-based filtering to reject unreliable suggestions.

Result: LLP substantially surpasses existing methods and generalizes well to unseen categories. On Xianyu platform, it raised static adoption rate from 40% to 72% at 30% coverage, maintaining 47% SAR even at 90% recall.

Conclusion: The LLM-based generative framework LLP effectively addresses second-hand product pricing challenges, demonstrating superior performance and practical deployment success on China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon),
inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay)
often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand
products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for
automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static
regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail
to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over
time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product
pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic
market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key
pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions.
To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a
two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative
policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning.
Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject
unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP
substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen
categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is
China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming
the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises
the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of
47\% even at 90\% recall.

*Francesco Maria Molfese,Luca Moroni,Ciro Porcaro,Simone Conia,Roberto Navigli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReTraceQA is a new benchmark for evaluating reasoning processes in Small Language Models (SLMs) on commonsense tasks, revealing that 14-24% of correct answers come from flawed reasoning, showing current metrics overestimate SLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of SLMs focuses only on final answer accuracy, ignoring the validity of reasoning processes, which can lead to overestimation of model capabilities.

Method: Introduced ReTraceQA benchmark with expert-annotated dataset for process-level evaluation, using strong LLMs as automated judges for reasoning-aware assessment instead of answer-only metrics.

Result: SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning in 14-24% of cases. When evaluated with reasoning-aware metrics, SLM performance drops significantly (up to 25% decrease) across all models and datasets.

Conclusion: Focusing only on final answer accuracy overestimates SLM capabilities; reasoning process evaluation is crucial for accurate assessment of commonsense reasoning abilities.

Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on
an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current
evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final
answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those
answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that
introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our
expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances
(14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning
processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by
evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the
ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models
(LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than
answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and
datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

TL;DR: ThinkLogit enables large non-reasoning models to perform complex reasoning using smaller reasoning models as guides through logit arithmetic, achieving significant accuracy improvements without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large models to exhibit complex reasoning behaviors like backtracking and self-correction without requiring additional training, which is typically costly.

Method: Proposes ThinkLogit decoding-time approach using logit arithmetic to guide large non-reasoning models with smaller reasoning models, and ThinkLogit-DPO which further optimizes the guider with preference training.

Result: Achieved 24.5% and 29.1% relative accuracy improvements on five reasoning benchmarks using Qwen2.5-32B guided by a 21x smaller model. Works across different model families and is orthogonal to other training methods.

Conclusion: ThinkLogit provides a practical, cost-effective way to unlock long reasoning capabilities in large models without expensive post-training, using smaller reasoning models as guides.

Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with
strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies
suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first
investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To
this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit
arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using
a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can
further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments
demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement
in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning
benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x
smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider
and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to
post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised
distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield
stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in
large-scale models without costly post-training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NL2GenSym is a framework that uses LLMs to automatically generate symbolic rules for SOAR cognitive architecture from natural language, achieving over 86% success rate and generating novel heuristic rules that significantly improve decision efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOAR architecture requires laborious manual rule coding, hindering practical adoption. LLMs show potential for automated rule generation but lack robust experimental validation.

Method: Proposes NL2GenSym framework with Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism: LLM-based Generator creates rules from natural language using RAG-accessed knowledge base, rules are executed in SOAR for validation, and LLM-based Critic iteratively refines rules based on execution feedback.

Result: Achieved 86% success rate in rule generation on Water Jug Problem dataset. Generated novel heuristic rules reducing average decision cycles to 1.98× optimal solution and 1/1000 of baseline. Smaller models achieved better performance than larger counterparts.

Conclusion: NL2GenSym successfully bridges the gap between LLMs and symbolic AI, enabling autonomous generation of effective symbolic rules from natural language with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the
development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its
practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging
Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules
generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research
predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental
validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage
to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework
that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic
rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel
Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided
by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge
base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are
immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their
correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based
Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our
specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen
series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success
rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the
framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision
cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of
baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym
enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger
counterparts.

*Eshaan Tanwar,Deepak Nathani,William Yang Wang,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic study of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models, revealing that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of representational subspace while preserving pre-trained representations. The authors propose 'tuning vectors' to capture directional parameter shifts and show they enhance instruction-following, generation quality, and cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While domain-specific fine-tuning of LLMs shows strong performance, the underlying mechanisms of how fine-tuning reshapes the parametric space are not well understood, particularly for domain-specialized models which remain under-explored compared to auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models.

Method: The authors propose 'tuning vectors' - a novel framework inspired by task vectors that explicitly capture directional parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. They systematically analyze domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models and examine directional alignment across model components.

Result: Fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of representational subspace while preserving pre-trained representations. Tuning vectors enhance instruction-following and generation quality, and combining vectors across domains improves generalization. These vectors primarily write new directional information into MLP layers while amplifying existing directions in attention heads.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into LLM adaptation and offer a general, interpretable framework for analyzing specialization in large language models through the lens of tuning vectors and directional parameter shifts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong
performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning
reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily
focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving
domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study
of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis
reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational
subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To
interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel
framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional
parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are
critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality.
Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved
generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these
vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the
model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings
offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable

*Xingyu Lin,Yilin Wen,En Wang,Du Su,Wenbin Liu,Chenfu Bao,Zhonghou Lv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TEPO is a novel token-level framework that addresses entropy collapse in GRPO methods by incorporating Markov Likelihood to link group-level rewards with tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO and related entropy-regularization methods face challenges with sparse token rewards in chain-of-thought reasoning, leading to entropy collapse or model collapse due to undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments.

Method: TEPO incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood) to link group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation, creating a token-level framework that addresses the limitations of current approaches.

Result: TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics (including @k and accuracy), sets new state-of-the-art on mathematical reasoning tasks, and significantly enhances training stability.

Conclusion: TEPO successfully addresses the entropy collapse problem in GRPO methods and demonstrates superior performance and stability in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting
their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related
entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token
rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on
undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to
entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel
token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood)
links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments
show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics
(including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on
mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training
stability.

*Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Alex Xie,Saujas Vaduguru,Daniel Fried,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes ambiguity in human-AI communication for data visualization code generation, develops a taxonomy of ambiguity types, proposes metrics to quantify them, and explores how multi-turn dialogue with pragmatic models can reduce ambiguity and improve code accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguities in natural language can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect the speaker's intent, particularly in data visualization where natural language impacts code generation for plots.

Method: Developed a taxonomy of ambiguity types and proposed metrics to quantify them. Used Matplotlib problems from DS-1000 dataset. Evaluated three pragmatic dialogue models (Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, Questions under Discussion) through simulated user studies to reduce ambiguity.

Result: The proposed ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations than uncertainty baselines. Multi-turn pragmatic dialogues successfully reduce ambiguity and enhance code accuracy by better matching user goals.

Conclusion: Multi-turn exchanges with pragmatic dialogue strategies are valuable for reducing ambiguity in code generation tasks, leading to improved alignment between generated code and user intent.

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

*Ziyu Zheng,Yaming Yang,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao,Xinyan Huang,Weigang Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MSGCOT is a multi-scale graph prompting framework that captures hierarchical structural features and uses progressive coarse-to-fine reasoning, outperforming single-granularity methods especially in few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph prompt-tuning methods use single-granularity approaches (node-level or subgraph-level), which overlook the multi-scale structural information inherent in graph data and limit prompt semantic diversity.

Method: Proposed MSGCOT framework with: 1) Lightweight low-rank coarsening network to capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis vectors, 2) Dynamic multi-scale information integration mimicking human coarse-to-fine cognition, forming progressive prompt chains.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets show MSGCOT outperforms state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning methods, with particularly superior performance in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Integrating multi-scale information into graph prompting through MSGCOT framework effectively addresses limitations of single-granularity approaches and demonstrates superior performance, especially in data-scarce settings.

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM SELECTOR is the first framework for active model selection of LLMs that efficiently identifies the best model with limited annotations by adaptively selecting informative queries and using judge-based oracle annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior evaluation approaches require fully annotated datasets, which is expensive and impractical for selecting the best LLM among many options.

Method: Adaptively selects a small set of informative queries to annotate and leverages a judge-based oracle annotation model to reduce annotation costs.

Result: Reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best LLM across 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs.

Conclusion: LLM SELECTOR provides an efficient and cost-effective solution for model selection in the era of numerous LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

### [89] [On the Representations of Entities in Auto-regressive Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09421)
*Victor Morand,Josiane Mothe,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces entity mention reconstruction as a framework to study how LLMs internally represent entities, proposing the Entity Lens method to generate multi-token entity mentions from hidden states and showing LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Named entities are fundamental knowledge building blocks in text, but it remains unclear how LLMs internally represent entities, with prior research focusing mainly on explicit relationships rather than entity representations themselves.

Method: The paper introduces entity mention reconstruction using task vectors and proposes the Entity Lens, which extends the logit-lens to predict multi-token mentions from various entity representations derived from LLM hidden states.

Result: The method consistently generates multi-token mentions from entity representations, providing evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and manipulate multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Conclusion: LLMs develop specialized mechanisms for entity representation that can handle multi-token entities, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Entity Lens framework for studying internal entity representations in language models.

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparative study of context management strategies for spoken dialog state tracking using Speech-LLMs, showing full spoken history yields best performance while compressed history offers good trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate different context management approaches for end-to-end spoken dialog state tracking and determine the most effective way to handle spoken conversation context.

Method: Systematic evaluation of three context strategies: traditional multimodal context (text history + spoken current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history using attention-pooling-based compression on the SpokenWOZ corpus.

Result: Full spoken conversation as input yields highest performance among similar-sized models, significantly surpassing prior methods. Compressed spoken history maintains competitive accuracy with reduced context size.

Conclusion: Full spoken history provides best performance for spoken dialog state tracking, while compressed history offers a practical trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency through more effective context utilization.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for
end-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically
evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken
current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches.
Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full
spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of
similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that
attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong
trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed
analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context
utilization.

TL;DR: KORMo-10B is the first large-scale open bilingual LLM for Korean, trained mainly on synthetic data (68.74% Korean portion), achieving performance comparable to multilingual baselines without model collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To construct the first fully open bilingual LLM for a non-English language (Korean) using predominantly synthetic data, addressing the challenge of low-resource language modeling.

Method: Trained KORMo-10B (10.8B parameters) from scratch on a Korean-English corpus with carefully curated synthetic data featuring balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles.

Result: The model achieves performance comparable to contemporary open-weight multilingual baselines across reasoning, knowledge, and instruction-following benchmarks, demonstrating synthetic data can sustain long-horizon pretraining without collapse.

Conclusion: Synthetic data-driven fully open models are viable for low-resource languages, with bilingual instruction tuning enabling near-native Korean reasoning and discourse coherence, establishing a transparent framework for future multilingual LLM research.

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a
fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language,
specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in
low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual
LLM research.

*Xixi Wang,Jordanka Kovaceva,Miguel Costa,Shuai Wang,Francisco Camara Pereira,Robert Thomson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned compact open-source language models outperform large closed LLMs like GPT-4o in extracting complex crash information from unstructured narratives, addressing privacy concerns and domain knowledge gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale analysis of free-text crash narratives is challenging due to lack of standardized tools, privacy concerns with closed LLMs, and poor performance on inference-heavy tasks with many categories.

Method: Fine-tuning compact open-source PLMs (BERT with LoRA) to inject domain-specific knowledge for identifying Manner of Collision and Crash Type from real-world crash narratives.

Result: Fine-tuned compact models outperformed GPT-4o on the CISS dataset, captured richer narrative details, and even corrected mislabeled annotations while requiring minimal training resources.

Conclusion: Compact open-source PLMs can effectively support reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives, offering privacy-preserving and domain-adapted alternatives to closed LLMs.

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been
shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However,
large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented
tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content
written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In
recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large
language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various
natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from
crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,
for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100
categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises
privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools
often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these
challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support
reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging
objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash
Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash
narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject
task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.
Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation
Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models
outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal
training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can
capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations
in the dataset.

TL;DR: The paper presents a full-text indexing pipeline for LLM training data using Elasticsearch on arm64 infrastructure, enabling large-scale data indexing and jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited access and inscrutability of LLM training data, which contains critical web-scraped data but remains inaccessible to the general scientific community despite open-weight LLM proliferation.

Method: Developed a full-text indexing pipeline using Elasticsearch parallel indices deployed on the Alps infrastructure (energy-efficient arm64 supercluster), indexing 8.6T tokens from 15.2T used for Apertus LLM training.

Result: Successfully indexed 8.6T tokens, demonstrating: 1) Elasticsearch portability to arm64 infrastructure, 2) feasibility of full-text indexing at modern LLM dataset scale, and 3) utility for jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.

Conclusion: The findings enable large-scale data indexing, facilitate transition to greener computation, and provide critical LLM safety tools through accessible, curated web search capabilities.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their
training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM
training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the
data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite
potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM
training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps
infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster,
we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM
family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline,
curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation
arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at
the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible
and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure
previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting
large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener
computation.

*Manuel Vargas Guzmán,Jakub Szymanik,Maciej Malicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show good recursive reasoning but struggle with compositional generalization in logical inference. A hybrid symbolic-neural architecture is proposed to overcome these limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and address the generalization limitations of neural models in logical reasoning, specifically distinguishing between compositionality and recursiveness.

Method: Used syllogistic fragment as benchmark, evaluated pre-trained LLMs, and proposed a hybrid architecture combining symbolic reasoning with neural computation.

Result: LLMs demonstrate reasonable proficiency in recursiveness but struggle significantly with compositionality. Hybrid model preserves efficiency even with small neural components.

Conclusion: Hybrid models effectively address key generalization barriers in neural reasoning systems by combining neural processing speed with symbolic reasoning completeness.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural
reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI) is a new task that internalizes complex multimodal policies into model parameters, eliminating the need for lengthy policy prompts during inference. The proposed TriMPI framework uses three-stage training to achieve better policy adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based conversational agents use lengthy predefined policies as in-context prompts, which are computationally expensive and difficult to follow faithfully. Multimodal policies governing visual and multimodal behaviors are particularly understudied.

Method: TriMPI: a three-stage training framework including (1) policy knowledge injection via continual pretraining, (2) supervised finetuning, and (3) PolicyRollout - a GRPO-style reinforcement learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses.

Result: TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy, generalization, and robustness to forgetting. The method shows improved policy-following without including policies during inference.

Conclusion: This is the first work on multimodal policy internalization, providing datasets, training recipes, and comprehensive evaluations to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined
policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these
LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such
policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly
complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large
fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that
govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.
Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and
demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on
text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),
a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model
parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy
during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build
two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using
tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first
injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised
finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement
learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for
grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,
generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal
policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and
comprehensive evaluations to foster future research. Project page:

Motivation: Statistics remains underexplored in LLM benchmarking despite advances in mathematical and logical reasoning, creating a gap in evaluating statistical intelligence.

Method: Used a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation for automated problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control from academic curricula and leading journals.

Result: Closed-source models like GPT5-mini achieved below 57% on research-level problems, with open-source models performing significantly worse, highlighting statistical reasoning challenges.

Conclusion: StatEval serves as a rigorous benchmark to advance statistical intelligence in LLMs, revealing current limitations in statistical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and
integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive
benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across
difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering
undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof
tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a
scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates
large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring
academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to
both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of
reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models
such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with
open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the
unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs.
We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical

TL;DR: Analyzing when unlabeled performance estimation methods produce reliable rankings across domains, finding LLM-based error predictors outperform drift-based and zero-shot baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding when NLP model performance estimates without labels produce reliable rankings across different domains, as prior work lacks clarity on ranking reliability.

Method: Two-step evaluation with four base classifiers and LLMs as error predictors, tested on GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets across 15 domains.

Result: LLM-based error predictors produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than drift-based or zero-shot baselines.

Conclusion: Ranking reliability depends on performance differences across domains and alignment between error model predictions and base model failure patterns, providing guidance for cross-domain model evaluation.

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for
understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures
based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when
these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this
paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step
evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models
as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets,
spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors
produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than
drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings:
ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are
larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true
failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can
be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

TL;DR: Proposes an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent classification and uses masked spectrograms for data augmentation to improve robustness against accent variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based ASR models are sensitive to accent and dialect variations, leading to high word error rates in linguistically diverse languages like English and Persian.

Method: Train spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent cues, mask influential regions, use masked spectrograms for data augmentation, and evaluate with Whisper model on English and Persian speech.

Result: Substantial WER reductions in both English and Persian settings, with newly collected Persian dataset establishing first systematic benchmark for accent variation in Persian ASR.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances ASR robustness against accent variability and advances development of multilingual ASR systems resilient to accent and dialect diversity.

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic
speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal
variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically
diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we
propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect
classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a
spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the
regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms
for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against
accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian
speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple
regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent
variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech
research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource,
linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model
demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER
reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness
of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR
systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset

TL;DR: The paper proposes Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to reduce overthinking in large reasoning models by penalizing excessive reasoning segments while maintaining accuracy.


<details>

Motivation: Large reasoning models with RLVR often suffer from overthinking - excessive reasoning that increases computational costs. Existing token-level penalization methods reduce token usage but harm model performance due to oversimplified supervision.

Method: GRSP uses step-level supervision with a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters, based on findings that reasoning segments correlate with both token consumption and model performance.

Result: GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without heavily compromising accuracy, especially on harder problems. It also stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across different model sizes.

Conclusion: The granularity of supervision is crucial for balancing efficiency and accuracy in reasoning models, and step-level methods like GRSP provide better regularization than token-level approaches.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

### [100] [Evaluating Robustness of Large Language Models Against Multilingual Typographical Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09536)
*Yihong Liu,Raoyuan Zhao,Lena Altinger,Hinrich Schütze,Michael A. Hedderich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MulTypo is a multilingual typo generation algorithm that evaluates LLM robustness across languages and tasks, finding typos consistently degrade performance, especially in generative and reasoning tasks, with language-dependent robustness patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM benchmarks assume clean input, leaving robustness to real-world typographical errors across languages underexplored, despite LLMs being deployed in multilingual applications with user inputs containing natural typos.

Method: Introduced MulTypo algorithm for multilingual typo generation based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing behavior. Evaluated 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five downstream tasks including language inference, multi-choice QA, mathematical reasoning, and machine translation.

Result: Typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and reasoning tasks. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance but may increase brittleness under noise. High-resource languages are more robust than low-resource ones, and translation from English is more robust than into English.

Conclusion: Findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and multilingual robustness evaluation. The code and data are made publicly available to support further research in this area.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual,
real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical
errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness
of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates
human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing
behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five
downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,
mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that
typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and
those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is
comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance
but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent
robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource
ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into
English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and
multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly
available.

### [101] [SPG: Sandwiched Policy Gradient for Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09541)
*Chengyu Wang,Paria Rashidinejad,DiJia Su,Song Jiang,Sid Wang,Siyan Zhao,Cai Zhou,Shannon Zejiang Shen,Feiyu Chen,Tommi Jaakkola,Yuandong Tian,Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPG is a novel policy gradient method for diffusion LLMs that uses both upper and lower bounds of log-likelihood to reduce bias, outperforming existing RL methods on mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning diffusion LLMs with human preferences via RL is challenging because their intractable log-likelihood prevents direct application of standard policy gradient methods, and existing surrogate methods like ELBO introduce significant bias.

Method: Proposed Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG) that leverages both upper and lower bounds of the true log-likelihood to reduce policy gradient bias, addressing limitations of one-sided approximations like ELBO.

Result: SPG significantly outperforms baselines based on ELBO or one-step estimation, improving accuracy by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500, 18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs.

Conclusion: SPG provides an effective solution for RL-based alignment of diffusion LLMs by reducing policy gradient bias through the use of both upper and lower bounds, demonstrating substantial performance improvements across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient
alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple
tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or
task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because
their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard
policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant
policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy
Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true
log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines
based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy
over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,
18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Diffusion LLMs face a Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC) where parallel decoding conflicts with causal reasoning requirements, limiting their effectiveness in complex tasks and causing inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Diffusion LLMs (DLLMs) struggle with complex reasoning despite their parallel decoding advantages, and to identify the fundamental conflict between parallel processing and sequential reasoning requirements.

Method: Behavioral analysis of DLLMs in reasoning tasks, identification of PSC, introduction of three scaling dimensions (parallel, diffusion, sequential), and empirical evaluation of scaling effects.

Result: DLLMs show genuine parallelism only for simple outputs, revert to autoregressive behavior in complex tasks, and suffer from limited self-reflection and reasoning depth due to PSC. Parallel scaling improves performance while diffusion/sequential scaling are constrained.

Conclusion: PSC is a fundamental limitation of DLLMs that requires specific mitigations like parallel-oriented prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling to reduce inefficiencies and improve reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high
throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive
alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which
enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often
required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core
Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and
complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for
directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to
autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive
prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking
without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,
reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we
introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and
sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,
diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these
findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented
prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce
PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

*Yu Wang,Tianhao Tan,Yifei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-stage framework for multilingual medical video retrieval that combines hierarchical chunking, knowledge graph enrichment, and efficient coarse-to-fine search with LLM re-ranking to achieve accurate and scalable retrieval across language boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems either compress hour-long videos into coarse embeddings (losing fine-grained details) or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching, making multilingual medical video retrieval challenging.

Method: Divide video subtitles into semantically coherent chunks, enrich with knowledge graph facts, organize into hierarchical tree with language-agnostic multilingual encoder embeddings, then use coarse-to-fine tree search with lightweight LLM re-ranking of top chunks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on mVCR test set, with ablation studies confirming complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an accurate and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video collections, avoiding exhaustive cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision.

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives
is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language
boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into
coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We
tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025
M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual
semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video
subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise
knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node
embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query
time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search
prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a
lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive
cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on
the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation
studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical
indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate
and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video
collections.

### [104] [A Comprehensive Evaluation of Multilingual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Performance, Consistency, and Faithfulness Across Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09555)
*Raoyuan Zhao,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Michael A. Hedderich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First comprehensive study of multilingual Chain-of-Thought reasoning, evaluating performance, consistency, and faithfulness across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Chain-of-Thought reasoning improves task performance in high-resource languages like English, the thinking traces (intermediate steps) remain underexplored in multilingual settings.

Method: Evaluated three dimensions: 1) Language compliance, accuracy, and consistency when models are instructed to think in target languages; 2) Crosslingual consistency by interchanging thinking traces between languages; 3) Faithfulness using perturbation-based techniques (truncation and error injection).

Result: Found strong language preferences and divergent performance across languages; quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary substantially by prompt language; models rely on traces to varying degrees across languages.

Conclusion: Multilingual CoT reasoning shows significant variations in performance, consistency, and faithfulness across different languages, highlighting the need for more comprehensive evaluation beyond final-answer accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in
high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined
final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,
i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of
multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,
consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,
answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or
prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language
preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess
crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between
languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary
substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt
perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to
probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models
rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support
future research.

*Daniel Brubaker,William Sheffield,Junyi Jessy Li,Kanishka Misra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces WUGNECTIVES, a dataset to test if discourse connectives can help language models learn about novel entities, finding that reasoning-focused tuning improves performance but models struggle with concessive connectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether discourse connectives can inform language models about world knowledge, flipping the traditional approach of using world knowledge to predict connectives.

Method: Created WUGNECTIVES dataset with 8,880 stimuli to evaluate LMs' inferences about novel entities in connective-linked contexts, testing 17 different LMs across scales and training regimens.

Result: Reasoning-focused tuning improved performance on most connectives, but all models systematically struggled with concessive connectives, with large performance variation across connective types.

Conclusion: Discourse connectives can help LMs acquire world knowledge, but concessive relations remain challenging, paving way for more nuanced investigation of language cues in LM learning.

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the
discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments,
with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip
this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of
understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To
this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates
LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the
entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various
scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning
behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,
there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,
with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a
concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations
into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release
WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

TL;DR: AutoPR automates research paper promotion by transforming papers into engaging social media content, with PRAgent framework showing 604% increase in watch time and 438% rise in likes compared to direct LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As research volume grows, scholars rely on social platforms for discovery and authors invest significant effort in promotion. AutoPR aims to automate this process to reduce human effort and ensure visibility.

Method: Introduces PRAgent, a multi-agent framework with three stages: multimodal content extraction, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and platform-specific adaptation for optimal reach and engagement.

Result: PRAgent achieved 604% increase in total watch time, 438% rise in likes, and at least 2.9x boost in overall engagement compared to direct LLM pipelines on the PRBench benchmark.

Conclusion: AutoPR is established as a tractable research problem, with platform modeling and targeted promotion being key contributors to performance gains, providing a roadmap for scalable automated scholarly communication.

Abstract: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on
social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in
promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this
process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic
Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,
engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release
PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to
high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity
(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment
(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent
framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with
multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and
platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum
reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates
substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%
rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation
studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most
to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research
problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly
communication.

*Xiao Yu,Baolin Peng,Michel Galley,Hao Cheng,Qianhui Wu,Janardhan Kulkarni,Suman Nath,Zhou Yu,Jianfeng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dyna-Mind is a two-stage training framework that teaches AI agents to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting, improving their performance in long-horizon interactive tasks like web navigation and computer use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning models excel in math and coding but perform poorly in long-horizon interactive tasks. The paper argues AI agents need "vicarious trial and error" - mental simulation of alternative futures - to enhance understanding and performance in complex environments.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) ReSim trains agents to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search trees using real experience, grounding reasoning in world dynamics. 2) Dyna-GRPO uses online RL with outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback to strengthen simulation and decision-making.

Result: Experiments on Sokoban, ALFWorld, and AndroidWorld benchmarks show ReSim effectively infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and Dyna-GRPO learns better policies for long-horizon, planning-intensive tasks using outcome and interaction-level signals.

Conclusion: Simulation plays a central role in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in challenging environments, addressing the gap between reasoning models' expert abilities and their performance in interactive tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS) enables real-time Spoken Language Models to perform Chain-of-Thought reasoning while speaking by using a dual-brain approach that separates reasoning from speech generation, achieving high accuracy with minimal latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Spoken Language Models struggle with Chain-of-Thought reasoning due to high latency from sequential generation, preventing real-time thinking while speaking like humans do.

Method: Proposes a brain-inspired dual-brain framework with a "Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning that paces and guides a separate "Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation, eliminating mode-switching.

Result: MPS significantly outperforms existing think-while-speaking methods, achieving 92.8% accuracy on Spoken-MQA mathematical reasoning and 82.5 score on URO-Bench speech conversation, with reasoning performance comparable to full CoT pre-computation but much lower latency.

Conclusion: The work effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time interaction in spoken language models.

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought
process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,
is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced
Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,
real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for
thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a
"Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate
"Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor
eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.
Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing
think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to
models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically
reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and
attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work
effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time
interaction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: P-TTS is an inference-time data augmentation method that uses only 90 manually selected reasoning examples to enhance LLM reasoning through systematic prompt variations and finetuning, achieving significant performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the laborious and resource-intensive process of curating large reasoning datasets for LLMs, while still leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities.

Method: Uses a small pool of 90 reasoning instances and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory contexts, then finetunes Qwen-2.5 models on this data.

Result: P-TTS models outperform competitive baselines with absolute accuracy gains up to +30.00% on AIME benchmarks, and show enhanced zero-shot generalization on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks like Gaokao, Kaoyan, and OlympiadBench.

Conclusion: Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit LLM reasoning in resource-constrained domains by effectively exploring the latent space of reasoning patterns with minimal annotation overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large
reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we
introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit
LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

TL;DR: Fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement with fewer than 1,000 images, matching or surpassing CNN baselines that require much more data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge vision and language by exploring how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with minimal supervision, addressing the underexploited potential of LLMs in specialized visual tasks.

Method: Comprehensive comparison of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on artificial text overlay detection in images, with fine-tuning on limited data.

Result: LLMs fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) achieved up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data.

Conclusion: LLM-based approaches demonstrate superior adaptability and data efficiency for real-world object detection tasks, providing actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in low-resource visual environments.

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

### [112] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses memorization in text-to-image diffusion models by showing that initial noise samples affect when the denoising trajectory escapes memorization basins, and proposes strategies to adjust initial noise for earlier escape while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often memorize training data, raising privacy and copyright concerns. Current mitigation approaches that delay classifier-free guidance result in poor image-text alignment, creating a need for methods that enable earlier escape from memorization basins.

Method: Two mitigation strategies that adjust initial noise samples: collective adjustment to find samples that encourage earlier basin escape, and individual adjustment to utilize specific initial samples that promote escape while preserving alignment.

Result: The proposed approaches significantly reduce memorization while maintaining good image-text alignment, demonstrating that initial noise manipulation can effectively address the memorization problem.

Conclusion: Initial noise samples play a crucial role in determining memorization escape timing, and strategic adjustment of these samples provides an effective way to reduce memorization in text-to-image diffusion models without compromising output quality.

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study examines gender representation biases in AI-generated occupational images from DALL-E 3 and Ideogram, finding both reinforce traditional gender stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in research on representational biases in AI-generated visualizations, as previous studies focused mainly on creation process and image quality.

Method: Generated over 750 AI images of occupations using DALL-E 3 and Ideogram, followed by thematic analysis to evaluate gender representation biases.

Result: Both AI image generators reinforce traditional gender stereotypes in occupational images, though to varying degrees.

Conclusion: AI visualization tools risk reinforcing narrow representations; suggestions provided for practitioners, individuals, and researchers to improve gender diversity in AI-generated images.

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

TL;DR: Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts router integrated into Visual Autoregressive Models reduces computational redundancy by 20% FLOPs and 11% faster inference while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Autoregressive Models suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer calls at increasing resolutions, leading to inefficiency.

Method: Introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts router with scale-aware thresholding that balances expert selection based on token complexity and resolution without additional training.

Result: Achieved 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster inference while matching the image quality of the dense baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic routing approach effectively trades compute for quality in Visual Autoregressive Models, eliminating computational redundancy while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [115] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised OOD detection method using epistemic uncertainty from hierarchical Bayesian modeling of GMM parameters in neural network feature space, achieving significant improvements over predictive entropy approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised OOD detection methods rely on predictive entropy which conflates epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, leading to misclassification of ambiguous in-distribution regions as OOD. Need for better uncertainty separation without requiring auxiliary OOD datasets.

Method: Hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model parameters in deep neural network feature space to derive epistemic uncertainty, avoiding the need for auxiliary data or additional training stages.

Result: Outperforms existing uncertainty-based methods on SemanticKITTI dataset: 18% improvement in AUROC, 22% increase in AUPRC, and 36% reduction in FPR95 (from 76% to 40%) compared to predictive entropy approach.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach effectively separates epistemic uncertainty for unsupervised OOD detection, significantly improving performance over conventional predictive entropy methods without requiring additional training data.

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-OSCAR is a hierarchical open-set classifier for HAR that identifies known activities with high accuracy while rejecting unknown ones, and can localize unknown classes to the nearest internal node in the hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between real-world activities and annotated datasets in HAR, and handle the issue of class dissimilarity where some activities overlap or encompass sub-activities.

Method: Arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy and develop Hi-OSCAR, which performs open-set classification while enabling localization of unknown activities to the nearest hierarchical node.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for known activities while effectively rejecting unknown activities. Also collected a new public dataset NFI_FARED with 19 activities from various contexts.

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR provides a robust solution for open-set HAR by leveraging hierarchical structure, offering more insight than binary known/unknown classification and enabling future research with the new NFI_FARED dataset.

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised clustering method for detecting high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in epilepsy patients, achieving high sensitivity (97.67%) and precision (98.57%) on controlled datasets, with strong correlation to surgical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HFOs are promising biomarkers for identifying epileptogenic zones, but visual detection is time-consuming and subjective. Automated detection methods are needed for clinical use.

Method: Unsupervised clustering technique applied to events extracted from time-frequency domain using S-transform, differentiating HFOs from spikes, background activity, and artifacts.

Result: Achieved 97.67% sensitivity, 98.57% precision, and 97.78% F-score on controlled dataset. In patients, showed 0.73 ratio between HFOs rates in resected vs non-resected contacts, correlating with surgical outcomes.

Conclusion: HFOs are confirmed as promising epileptogenicity biomarkers. Removing HFOs (especially fast ripple) leads to seizure freedom, while remaining HFOs lead to recurrence.

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes DINOv2's internal representations using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), revealing functional specialization across tasks, geometric properties of learned concepts, and proposes a new Minkowski Representation Hypothesis based on convex mixtures of archetypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what DINOv2 actually perceives internally, as it's widely used for object recognition, scene understanding, and action recognition but its internal representations remain unknown.

Method: Adopts Linear Representation Hypothesis and operationalizes it using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to create a 32,000-unit dictionary. Analyzes downstream task recruitment patterns, geometry/statistics of learned concepts, and proposes Minkowski Representation Hypothesis.

Result: Found functional specialization: classification uses 'Elsewhere' concepts (learned negations), segmentation uses boundary detectors, depth estimation uses monocular depth cues. Representations are partly dense, evolve toward coherence, tokens occupy low-dimensional locally connected sets. Proposed convex mixture archetype structure.

Conclusion: Proposes Minkowski Representation Hypothesis where tokens are formed by convex mixtures of archetypes, grounded in conceptual spaces and multi-head attention mechanisms, providing a refined framework for interpreting vision-transformer representations.

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyDAE is a physics-guided degradation-adaptive expert model for remote sensing image restoration that transforms implicit degradation features into explicit decision signals to handle multiple heterogeneous degradations like haze, noise, blur, and low-light conditions with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one restoration methods overly rely on implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation physics, making them ineffective for complex and heterogeneous degradations in remote sensing images.

Method: Two-stage cascaded architecture with Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) to analyze degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives, plus physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation strategies.

Result: Superior performance across all four restoration tasks on three benchmark datasets (MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, MDRS-Landsat), with substantial improvements in restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count and computational complexity.

Conclusion: PhyDAE achieves optimal balance between performance and efficiency, comprehensively outperforming state-of-the-art methods in remote sensing image restoration.

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-centric understanding and generation are typically studied separately, but there's a need for unified spatial intelligence that can both interpret and create scenes from different viewpoints.

Method: Introduces a novel paradigm that treats camera as language, integrates language regression and diffusion-based generation, and uses a large-scale dataset of 4M vision-language-camera triplets with both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps.

Result: Puffin demonstrates superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric generation and understanding, and generalizes to diverse cross-view tasks like spatial imagination, world exploration, and photography guidance.

Conclusion: The unified approach enables flexible and reliable spatial generation and understanding, advancing multimodal spatial intelligence research.

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric

TL;DR: Proposes Structured Output Regularization (SOR) for transfer learning, which freezes internal network structures while using group lasso and L1 penalties to adapt models to specific data with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transfer learning freezes weights and adds task-specific layers, which limits adaptation to domain-specific features and can cause overfitting with limited data.

Method: SOR framework freezes internal network structures (e.g., convolutional filters) and uses group lasso combined with L1 penalties to tailor models to specific data with minimal additional parameters.

Result: Achieved competitive results on three few-shot medical imaging classification tasks using DenseNet121 and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established benchmarks.

Conclusion: SOR is a simple yet effective framework that enables broad applicability for transfer learning tasks by adapting models to specific domains with minimal parameters.

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks for multimodal large language models focus on specific domains like planning or spatial understanding, lacking systematic evaluation of comprehensive embodied capabilities needed for physical world interaction.

Method: Created BEAR benchmark with 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across 14 domains in 6 categories. Proposed BEAR-Agent that integrates pretrained vision models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning capabilities.

Result: Evaluation of 20 representative MLLMs revealed persistent limitations across all embodied capability domains. BEAR-Agent achieved 9.12% absolute gain and 17.5% relative improvement on GPT-5, and improved performance on embodied tasks in simulated environments.

Conclusion: BEAR provides systematic evaluation of MLLM embodied capabilities, and BEAR-Agent demonstrates that integrating specialized vision models can substantially enhance MLLM performance across diverse embodied tasks.

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

TL;DR: A biologically inspired defense framework that uses foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in to mitigate adversarial attacks without requiring model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional adversarial defenses are computationally intensive, while the human visual system achieves inherent robustness through biological mechanisms like attention-guided sparse sampling and predictive coding.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning-guided saccades to capture multiple foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into reconstructed images before classification, incorporating three biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet show improved robustness across diverse classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead compared to other defense techniques.

Conclusion: The biologically inspired preprocessing effectively mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and enables seamless integration with existing systems without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

Motivation: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution rely on self-attention with quadratic complexity, creating computational bottlenecks. Linear Attention offers linear complexity but has been hindered by unsolved challenges like training instability and perception-distortion trade-offs.

Method: Uses Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF) to resolve training instability, SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to mitigate perception-distortion trade-off, and TAG guidance paradigm based on 'precision-over-volume' principle.

Result: LinearSR simultaneously delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its core diffusion forward pass achieves SOTA-level speed while maintaining competitive multi-step inference time.

Conclusion: This work provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future research in efficient generative super-resolution.

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

*Paula Maddigan,Andrew Lensen,Rachael C. Shaw*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision pipeline for wildlife re-identification using key frame extraction from videos of kākā parrots, providing a non-invasive alternative to traditional tagging methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wildlife monitoring methods like leg banding are invasive and time-consuming. Computer vision offers promising non-invasive solutions for efficient animal re-identification and population monitoring.

Method: Unsupervised pipeline combining YOLO and Grounding DINO for object detection, optical flow blur detection, DINOv2 for image encoding, and clustering methods to extract representative key frames from video recordings at custom feeders.

Result: The proposed key frame selection methods achieve high accuracy in kākā re-identification, providing quality image collections for individual recognition.

Conclusion: This AI-based approach offers a valuable non-invasive alternative to physical tagging, improving wildlife monitoring with applications in ecology and conservation biology.

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

### [128] [Q-Router: Agentic Video Quality Assessment with Expert Model Routing and Artifact Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08789)
*Shuo Xing,Soumik Dey,Mingyang Wu,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router is an agentic framework for universal video quality assessment that uses vision-language models as routers to dynamically select and ensemble expert models based on video content, improving generalization, interpretability, and performance across diverse video types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA models trained with direct score supervision suffer from poor generalization across diverse content (UGC, short-form videos, AIGC), limited interpretability, and lack of extensibility to novel use cases or content types.

Method: Multi-tier model routing system with VLMs as real-time routers that dynamically reason and ensemble appropriate expert models conditioned on input video semantics, including a heavy tier for spatiotemporal artifacts localization for interpretability.

Result: Matches or surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on various benchmarks, substantially improves generalization and interpretability, excels on Q-Bench-Video benchmark, and capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts.

Conclusion: Q-Router shows promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems and has potential as a reward function for post-training video generation models.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

*Yuanhao Zou,Zhaozheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for Medical VQA that addresses modality alignment, hard negative mining, and knowledge fusion through multi-level alignment, soft label-based hard negative mining, and gated cross-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Med-VQA approaches lack unified modality alignment, under-explore hard negatives, and may introduce irrelevant information through knowledge fusion techniques.

Method: Three key components: (1) unified multi-level modality alignment using contrastive learning and optimal transport, (2) hard negative mining with soft labels, (3) Gated Cross-Attention Module for answer vocabulary integration.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art on multiple Med-VQA datasets including RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key challenges in Med-VQA through comprehensive modality alignment, improved negative handling, and selective knowledge integration.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

*Rohan Choudhury,Shanchuan Lin,Jianyi Wang,Hao Chen,Qi Zhao,Feng Cheng,Lu Jiang,Kris Kitani,Laszlo A. Jeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR accelerates video super-resolution by identifying and skipping computation on low-detail regions, achieving up to 60% faster processing with no quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based super-resolution is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to higher resolutions and longer videos, while many video regions are low-detail and don't need refinement.

Method: Propose SkipSR framework that identifies low-detail regions from low-resolution input and skips computation on them entirely, only super-resolving areas that require refinement.

Result: Achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality in standard SR benchmarks.

Conclusion: SkipSR provides an effective strategy to accelerate video super-resolution while preserving perceptual quality in both standard and one-step diffusion SR models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video

### [131] [D-CoDe: Scaling Image-Pretrained VLMs to Video via Dynamic Compression and Question Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08818)
*Yiyang Huang,Yizhou Wang,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-CoDe is a training-free framework that adapts image-pretrained vision-language models for video understanding by addressing perception bottlenecks and token overload through dynamic compression and question decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending image-based vision-language models to video domain is challenging due to dense temporal visual inputs that exceed model capacity, specifically facing perception bottlenecks and token overload issues.

Method: Proposes D-CoDe with two components: dynamic compression (adaptive frame selection and content-aware spatial token aggregation) and question decomposition (reformulating queries into sub-questions).

Result: Effectively improves video understanding across various benchmarks and shows strong performance on challenging long-video tasks.

Conclusion: D-CoDe demonstrates potential for handling complex video-language tasks without requiring additional training, offering an efficient adaptation approach for video large language models.

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

### [132] [FOLK: Fast Open-Vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation via Label-guided Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08849)
*Hongrui Wu,Zhicheng Gao,Jin Cao,Kelu Yao,Wen Shen,Zhihua Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOLK is a fast open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method that uses label-guided knowledge distillation to avoid 2D mapping noise and accelerate inference by directly classifying 3D instances from point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods map 3D instances to 2D RGB-D images for classification using VLMs, which introduces noise from 2D occlusions and incurs high computational costs, slowing down inference speed.

Method: Proposes a teacher-student framework: a teacher model generates high-quality 2D CLIP embeddings with visibility and viewpoint diversity, while a 3D student model directly produces 3D embeddings. Uses label-guided distillation to transfer open-vocabulary knowledge from 2D to 3D.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 with AP50 score of 35.7, while running 6.0x to 152.2x faster than previous methods. Also tested on Replica dataset.

Conclusion: FOLK effectively addresses noise and computational issues in open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation through knowledge distillation, achieving both superior performance and significant speed improvements.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

*Ronan John,Anis Chihoub,Ryan Meegan,Gina Sidelli,Jeffery Neyhart,Peter Oudemans,Kristin Dana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised vision transformer approach for cranberry crop monitoring that learns temporal evolution without manual annotations, enabling growth prediction and variety comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual crop monitoring is time-consuming, and deep learning approaches require tedious annotations. There's a need for automated, interpretable methods for tracking crop growth over time.

Method: Fine-tuning vision transformers using self-supervised learning with two pretext tasks: time regression and class prediction to learn latent space for time-lapse evolution of plant appearance.

Result: The method creates interpretable 2D temporal tracks that model crop growth over time and can distinguish temporal differences between cranberry varieties. A novel time-lapse dataset of 8 cranberry varieties with 52 observations over 4 months is provided.

Conclusion: The self-supervised ViT approach provides an interpretable time-series model for crop growth monitoring that avoids manual annotations and can generalize to other crops.

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

*Daiki Yoshikawa,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP uses an ℓ₁-Product metric on Cartesian products of hyperbolic spaces to simultaneously capture hierarchical relationships within concept families and compositional relationships across different concept families in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle to simultaneously express hierarchical structures within concept families and compositional structures across different concept families. While hyperbolic space efficiently captures tree-like hierarchies, its suitability for representing compositionality remains unclear.

Method: PHyCLIP employs an ℓ₁-Product metric on a Cartesian product of hyperbolic factors. Intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual hyperbolic factors, while cross-family composition is captured by the ℓ₁-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra.

Result: Experiments on zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the embedding space.

Conclusion: PHyCLIP effectively resolves the dilemma of simultaneously capturing hierarchical and compositional semantic structures in vision-language models through its novel geometric approach using hyperbolic product spaces.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

*Yufei Song,Ziqi Zhou,Qi Lu,Hangtao Zhang,Yifan Hu,Lulu Xue,Shengshan Hu,Minghui Li,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegTrans is a novel transfer attack framework that improves adversarial example transferability across segmentation models by dividing inputs into local regions and remapping semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples for perturbation optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods for segmentation models show poor transferability due to complex contextual dependencies and feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models.

Method: Divides input samples into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples, which replace original samples for perturbation optimization while retaining only local semantic information.

Result: Significantly improves transfer attack success rates by average 8.55% compared to state-of-the-art methods, with over 100% improvement in computational efficiency, validated on PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes datasets across four segmentation models and three backbone networks.

Conclusion: SegTrans effectively addresses transferability challenges in segmentation model attacks through local semantic remapping, achieving superior performance without additional computational overhead.

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASVP is a runtime defense method that protects image restoration models from knowledge distillation attacks by perturbing feature maps using singular value decomposition to disrupt student learning while maintaining teacher performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge distillation attacks threaten deep model IP by training student networks using teacher outputs. Existing classification defenses don't work well for image restoration due to continuous, high-dimensional outputs requiring spatial coherence.

Method: ASVP uses singular value decomposition on internal feature maps, amplifying top-k singular values to inject structured high-frequency perturbations that disrupt distillation alignment while preserving output quality.

Result: ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60-75% across five restoration tasks (super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, deraining) with negligible impact on teacher performance.

Conclusion: ASVP provides a practical, strong defense against unauthorized knowledge distillation for open-source restoration models, outperforming prior methods with consistent protection.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ro-Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on dynamic out-of-distribution counterfactual video test sets, showing current models degrade significantly on manipulated content but can be improved through counterfactual fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored robustness of MLLMs when faced with manipulated video content, particularly counterfactual scenarios that deviate from normal distributions.

Method: Created Ro-Bench benchmark with high-quality, diverse video data by editing Style, Object, Background and their compositions to generate counterfactual test sets. Evaluated 8 recent video MLLMs and tested fine-tuning with counterfactual data.

Result: Current MLLMs exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to counterfactual video content. Fine-tuning with counterfactual data improved performance by 21.73% on Ro-Bench and 12.78% across 20 tasks in MVBench dataset.

Conclusion: Counterfactual data is highly effective for enhancing MLLMs' video understanding ability and robustness, demonstrating the importance of testing models on out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The

TL;DR: Proposes an object-focused data augmentation framework using segmentation and diffusion-based synthesis to enhance animal detection in drone-based monitoring systems with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limited data availability in aerial drone-based animal health monitoring, compounded by scene-specific issues like small, occluded animals and lack of domain-specific datasets for transfer learning.

Method: Segments animals from backgrounds and augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create realistic, diverse scenes for animal detection.

Result: Initial experiments show superior performance compared to baseline models on animal detection task using the augmented dataset.

Conclusion: The method enables real-time animal health monitoring in data-scarce scenarios by generating domain-specific data, bridging the gap between limited data and practical applications.

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DisTANCE benchmark showing LVLMs have limited visual estimation precision, proposes Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) paradigm to improve perception by decomposing problems into sub-tasks, achieving significant accuracy improvements from 8.0% to 64.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference-time scaling methods work well for reasoning but have unclear impact on visual perception in LVLMs, which treat perception as one-shot output without modeling perceptual processes.

Method: Proposes Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, combined with reinforcement learning techniques.

Result: PTS significantly improves perception accuracy from 8.0% to 64.7% on DisTANCE benchmark, generalizes to out-of-domain tasks, and even with synthetic data improves both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks.

Conclusion: PTS enables perception to align with inference-time scaling by introducing more perception-related tokens and increasing attention to image tokens, providing a new paradigm for improving LVLM visual perception capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

### [140] [mmJoints: Expanding Joint Representations Beyond (x,y,z) in mmWave-Based 3D Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08970)
*Zhenyu Wang,Mahathir Monjur,Shahriar Nirjon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmJoints is a framework that enhances mmWave-based 3D pose estimation by adding joint descriptors that explicitly indicate sensing likelihood and location reliability, improving interpretability and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In mmWave pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections cause models to rely on statistical priors rather than actual sensor data, degrading performance in downstream tasks like gesture and activity recognition.

Method: Augments pre-trained mmWave pose estimators with additional joint descriptors that estimate the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the reliability of its predicted location, making bias explicit rather than mitigating it.

Result: Achieves descriptor estimation error rate below 4.2%, improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5%, and boosts activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods across 13 pose estimation settings with over 115,000 signal frames.

Conclusion: mmJoints successfully enhances mmWave-based pose estimation by making model biases explicit through joint descriptors, leading to improved interpretability and better performance in downstream applications.

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

*Maoliang Li,Ke Li,Yaoyang Liu,Jiayu Chen,Zihao Zheng,Yinjun Wu,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMIR is an efficient hierarchical scheduling framework for image retrieval that improves accuracy and reduces computation by 3.5x compared to existing multi-vector retrieval systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-vector retrieval approaches suffer from limited accuracy and efficiency due to poor alignment between queries and varying image objects, and redundant fine-grained image segments.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical paradigm with multiple intermediate granularities for better query-image alignment, uses cross-hierarchy similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize redundancy, and automatically configures parameters for different datasets.

Result: Achieves substantial accuracy improvements and reduces computation by up to 3.5 times compared to existing multi-vector retrieval systems.

Conclusion: HiMIR provides an effective solution for efficient and accurate image retrieval in multimodal large language model applications.

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HandEval, the first quality assessment model specifically for generated hand regions in text-to-image models, addressing structural distortions and unrealistic textures in AI-generated hands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with generating accurate details in complex local regions like human hands, exhibiting structural distortions and unrealistic textures. The quality assessment of hand regions is largely neglected, limiting downstream task performance.

Method: Proposed HandPair dataset with 48k high- and low-quality hand pairs for training without manual annotation. Developed HandEval model that leverages MLLM capabilities and incorporates hand keypoint prior knowledge for quality assessment.

Result: HandEval aligns better with human judgments than existing SOTA methods. When integrated into image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, it significantly enhances generated hand realism and detection accuracy.

Conclusion: HandEval provides an effective solution for hand quality assessment in generated images and demonstrates universal effectiveness in downstream applications including image generation optimization and AIGC detection.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAChroma introduces imperceptible perturbations to grayscale images to prevent unauthorized AI colorization, addressing copyright concerns in manga and films.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent copyright infringement from unauthorized AI colorization of monochrome content like manga and films, as no effective prevention methods currently exist.

Method: Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma) optimizes imperceptible perturbations using Laplacian filter for perceptual quality, with diverse input transformations for transferability and robustness.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet and Danbooru show PAChroma effectively degrades colorization quality while maintaining visual appearance, meeting effectiveness, imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness criteria.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first defensive paradigm against illegitimate AI colorization, enabling copyright protection for visual content in generative media.

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SJD2 accelerates autoregressive text-to-image models by enabling parallel token generation through speculative Jacobi-denoising decoding, reducing inference time while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive text-to-image models suffer from slow inference due to sequential token-by-token decoding requiring thousands of model forward passes per image.

Method: Introduces speculative Jacobi-denoising decoding with next-clean-token prediction paradigm, fine-tuning models to accept noise-perturbed embeddings and predict clean tokens, enabling parallel generation through iterative denoising in embedding space.

Result: Method accelerates generation by reducing model forward passes while maintaining visual quality of generated images.

Conclusion: SJD2 provides an effective framework for parallel token generation in autoregressive models through denoising-based Jacobi iterations, significantly improving inference efficiency.

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

### [145] [On Epistemic Uncertainty of Visual Tokens for Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09008)
*Hoigi Seo,Dong Un Kang,Hyunjin Cho,Joohoon Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies uncertain visual tokens in vision encoders as a key cause of object hallucination in LVLMs, proposes a method to detect and mask these tokens using adversarial perturbations, and shows significant reduction in hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) - where models describe objects not present in input images - remains a critical challenge that needs to be addressed.

Method: Proposes identifying uncertain visual tokens using adversarial perturbations to measure representation deviations, then masking these tokens during self-attention in middle vision encoder layers to suppress their influence.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can work synergistically with other existing techniques.

Conclusion: Modifying only the vision encoder by detecting and masking uncertain visual tokens is an effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

*Xiaoxiao Ma,Feng Zhao,Pengyang Ling,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiang Wei,Hu Yu,Jie Huang,Zhixiong Zeng,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an entropy-informed decoding strategy for autoregressive image generation that improves quality and speed by using dynamic temperature control and entropy-aware speculative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive image generation models have sampling issues due to lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution of image tokens compared to text tokens.

Method: Two main innovations: 1) dynamic temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves higher generation quality with faster synthesis speed, achieving near-lossless generation at about 85% of the inference cost of conventional acceleration methods.

Conclusion: The proposed entropy-informed decoding strategy effectively enhances both generation quality and sampling speed across diverse AR image generation models.

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

*Weitong Kong,Zichao Zeng,Di Wen,Jiale Wei,Kunyu Peng,June Moh Goo,Jan Boehm,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DGLSS-NL, a novel task for domain generalization in LiDAR semantic segmentation under noisy labels, and proposes DuNe, a dual-view framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor imperfections, occlusions, and human errors, which degrades segmentation accuracy and is amplified under domain shifts. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains unexplored.

Method: Proposed DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on confidence-aware filtering of predictions.

Result: Achieved 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with overall Arithmetic Mean of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean of 48.50%.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks and shows state-of-the-art performance, addressing the gap in noisy-label learning for 3D LiDAR segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A post-training framework for latent diffusion models that incorporates lesion-aware pixel space objectives to improve medical image-to-image translation, particularly for enhancing lesion delineation in brain CT-to-MRI conversion for stroke diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are efficient but may compromise pixel-level details crucial for medical images, especially small lesions that are clinically significant. This limitation affects diagnostic reliability in applications like stroke diagnosis where accurate lesion reconstruction is critical.

Method: Proposed a novel post-training framework that incorporates lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives into pre-trained LDMs. This approach enhances both overall image quality and lesion delineation precision without requiring full model retraining.

Result: Evaluated on brain CT-to-MRI translation for 817 acute ischemic stroke patients. The framework improved overall image quality and enhanced lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.

Conclusion: The post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs and shows substantial potential for broader applications across diverse medical image translation tasks, addressing the critical need for accurate lesion reconstruction in clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

TL;DR: An image-based anomaly detection framework using vision transformers for monitoring flexible microelectrode implantation in brain cortex, with progressive feature sampling and channel selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flexible microelectrode implantation is challenging due to deformable probe structure and critical bio-tissue interaction, requiring careful monitoring for reliability and safety.

Method: Uses microscopic cameras and vision transformer with progressive granularity patch feature sampling and selective channel features from pretrained ViT at four checkpoints.

Result: Validated effectiveness with image datasets from implantation system, addressing sensitivity-tolerance trade-off in different locations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully monitors FME implantation process through image-based anomaly detection with optimized feature extraction.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normal estimation methods struggle with modeling fine-grained geometric structures, and current Mamba-based approaches focus mainly on global shape understanding while neglecting local geometric details.

Method: Proposes Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) for multi-scale point cloud patch feature fusion, and Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed components.

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by effectively capturing fine-grained geometric structures for improved point cloud normal estimation.

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV applications in military reconnaissance and environmental monitoring require accurate MOT for situational awareness, but face challenges from complex backgrounds, small targets, and occlusions.

Method: GL-DT framework with Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module for joint motion-appearance modeling, global-local collaborative detection strategy, and JPTrack tracking algorithm.

Result: Significantly improves MOT continuity and stability while maintaining real-time performance, enhancing small-target detection and reducing ID switches/trajectory fragmentation.

Conclusion: Provides strong support for advancing UAV detection and tracking technologies by effectively addressing key challenges in multi-object tracking.

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

TL;DR: Dense2MoE transforms dense Diffusion Transformers into Mixture of Experts structure to reduce inference overhead while maintaining performance, achieving 60% parameter reduction without degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers have large parameter sizes causing substantial inference overhead, and existing compression methods like pruning lead to severe performance degradation due to reduced model capacity.

Method: Replace FFNs in DiT Blocks with MoE layers (62.5% reduction in activated FFN parameters) and introduce Mixture of Blocks for selective activation. Use multi-step distillation pipeline with Taylor metric-based expert initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature loss.

Result: Achieves 60% reduction in activated parameters while maintaining original performance, surpassing pruning-based approaches in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for efficient text-to-image generation by preserving model capacity through structured sparsification via MoE transformation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

*Weikai Huang,Jieyu Zhang,Taoyang Jia,Chenhao Zheng,Ziqi Gao,Jae Sung Park,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOS is a scalable synthetic data pipeline that pastes high-quality object segments into images using layout priors and generative relighting, outperforming larger real-image datasets on detection and grounding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large annotated datasets are costly, biased, and hard to scale, while existing synthetic data lack flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.

Method: Object-centric composition strategy that pastes synthetic object segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative relighting to produce accurate masks, boxes, and referring expressions.

Result: Models trained on 100K synthetic SOS images outperform those trained on larger real datasets (GRIT with 20M images, V3Det with 200K), achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4 N_Acc on gRefCOCO grounding. Also improves performance in low-data settings.

Conclusion: SOS enables controllable dataset construction and improves generalization across data scales, with particular benefits in limited real data scenarios and targeted data generation for challenging tasks.

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

*Dominik Winter,Mai Bui,Monica Azqueta Gavaldon,Nicolas Triltsch,Marco Rosati,Nicolas Brieu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSDM is a multimodal semantic diffusion model that generates realistic image-mask pairs for cell/nuclei segmentation to address data scarcity, particularly for rare morphologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of annotated data for cell and nuclei segmentation in computational pathology, especially for rare or atypical morphologies, where manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly.

Method: Uses a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) conditioned on cellular/nuclear morphologies (horizontal/vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, integrated via multi-head cross-attention.

Result: Synthetic images closely match real data with low Wasserstein distances. Incorporation of synthetic samples significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on specific cell types like columnar cells.

Conclusion: Multimodal diffusion-based augmentation effectively enriches datasets and improves robustness and generalizability of cell/nuclei segmentation models, paving the way for broader generative model applications in computational pathology.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

### [156] [Polar Separable Transform for Efficient Orthogonal Rotation-Invariant Image Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09125)
*Satya P. Singh,Rashmi Chaudhry,Anand Srivastava,Jagath C. Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSepT is a novel polar separable transform that overcomes computational complexity and numerical instability issues of classical orthogonal moments like Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments through complete kernel factorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical orthogonal moment-based image representations suffer from high computational complexity (O(n³N²) to O(n⁶N²)) and numerical instability (O(N⁴) condition number) at large orders, which limits their practical applications.

Method: PSepT uses tensor-product construction combining Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent radial and angular processing through complete kernel factorization.

Result: PSepT reduces computational complexity to O(N² log N), memory requirements to O(N²), and condition number scaling to O(√N), representing exponential improvements. It maintains orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and rotation-covariance while enabling exact reconstruction.

Conclusion: PSepT enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible with classical methods, offering better numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive performance on structured datasets, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis applications.

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

### [157] [Training Feature Attribution for Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09135)
*Aziz Bacha,Thomas George*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes training feature attribution, which links test predictions to specific regions in training images, providing joint analysis of input features and training examples for better model explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are opaque, and existing explainability methods focus either on input features or training examples separately, but both perspectives should be studied jointly to improve trust and accountability.

Method: Training feature attribution - linking test-time predictions to specific regions of specific training images to provide fine-grained, test-specific explanations of model behavior.

Result: Experiments on vision datasets show the method identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious correlations (like patch-based shortcuts) that conventional attribution methods fail to expose.

Conclusion: Training feature attribution provides new insights into the inner workings of deep models by jointly analyzing test predictions and training data regions, offering more comprehensive explanations than existing methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

### [158] [Online Topological Localization for Navigation Assistance in Bronchoscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09144)
*Clara Tomasini,Luis Riazuelo,Ana C. Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization pipeline that provides navigation assistance without requiring patient CT scans, using only phantom data for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bronchoscopy navigation methods require CT scans and additional sensors, which involve extra setup and training. A simpler topological localization approach could provide sufficient navigation assistance without these requirements.

Method: An image-based bronchoscopy topological localization pipeline trained exclusively on phantom data, eliminating the need for real data labeling and patient CT scans.

Result: The approach shows good generalization capabilities and surpasses existing methods, particularly on real data test sequences.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides effective bronchoscopy navigation assistance without requiring patient CT scans or complex sensor setups, demonstrating strong performance on real data.

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

*Yankun Wu,Zakaria Laskar,Giorgos Kordopatis-Zilos,Noa Garcia,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach for instance-level recognition that synthetically generates diverse object instances from multiple domains without using real images, enabling efficient training of foundation models and improving retrieval performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instance-level recognition faces challenges in creating large-scale annotated datasets due to its fine-grained nature, limiting real-world applicability across domains.

Method: Synthetically generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied conditions and backgrounds without relying on any real images, then fine-tunes foundation vision models on this generated data.

Result: Significantly improves retrieval performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains.

Conclusion: Offers an efficient and effective alternative to extensive data collection and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where only domain names are needed as input, enabling wide real-world applications.

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

### [160] [TARO: Toward Semantically Rich Open-World Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09173)
*Yuchen Zhang,Yao Lu,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO is a novel detection framework that identifies unknown objects and classifies them into meaningful coarse parent categories within a semantic hierarchy, rather than treating all unknowns as a single class.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional object detectors fail with novel objects in real-world scenarios, and existing open-set methods that simply label unknowns as 'Unknown' are insufficient for safety-critical applications where more descriptive categorization is needed.

Method: TARO uses a sparsemax-based head for objectness modeling, hierarchy-guided relabeling for auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that learns hierarchical relationships to categorize unknowns into coarse parent classes.

Result: TARO can categorize up to 29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduces confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieves competitive performance in both unknown recall and known mAP.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between simple unknown detection and more useful hierarchical categorization of novel objects, enhancing decision-making in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online Video Depth Anything (oVDA) enables real-time monocular depth estimation by adapting LLM techniques like feature caching and frame masking, achieving 42 FPS on A100 and 20 FPS on Jetson with superior accuracy and VRAM efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video Depth Anything (VDA) shows strong performance but relies on batch-processing, making it unsuitable for online/real-time applications. This work addresses the need for efficient online video depth estimation deployable on edge devices.

Method: Adapts techniques from Large Language Models: uses latent feature caching during inference and frame masking during training to enable online processing without batch dependencies.

Result: oVDA outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both accuracy and VRAM usage. Achieves 42 FPS on NVIDIA A100 and 20 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson edge device.

Conclusion: The proposed oVDA method successfully enables real-time video depth estimation with low VRAM requirements, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices. Code and compilation scripts will be released for easy implementation.

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides the first comprehensive baseline study comparing seven deep learning approaches for cricket shot classification, revealing significant performance gaps between literature claims and practical results, with modern EfficientNet-GRU achieving 92.25% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cricket shot classification from video is challenging due to the need for effective spatiotemporal modeling, and there are discrepancies between reported accuracies in literature and practical implementation results that need systematic investigation.

Method: Implemented and evaluated seven deep learning approaches across four paradigms: CNN-LSTM, attention-based models, vision transformers, transfer learning, and EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark with standardized evaluation protocols using PyTorch Lightning.

Result: Found significant performance gaps - re-implementations of previous methods achieved 46.0%, 55.6%, and 57.7% vs. reported 96%, 99.2%, and 93%. Modern EfficientNet-B0 with GRU achieved 92.25% accuracy, showing substantial improvements with modern architectures.

Conclusion: Modern architectures with systematic optimization can achieve high accuracy in cricket shot classification, and standardized evaluation protocols are critically important for reproducible research in sports video analysis.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAAD-X dataset and VCBM framework for interpretable driver intent prediction in autonomous driving, showing transformers outperform CNNs in interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As autonomous systems interact more with humans, interpretability of decision-making becomes crucial for safety. Understanding environment representations remains challenging in deep learning systems.

Method: Created DAAD-X multimodal dataset with hierarchical textual explanations from driver eye-gaze and vehicle perspective. Proposed Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM) that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations without post-hoc techniques.

Result: Transformer-based models show greater interpretability than CNN-based models. Introduced multilabel t-SNE visualization to illustrate disentanglement and causal correlation among explanations.

Conclusion: The work advances interpretable driver intent prediction through new dataset and framework, demonstrating transformers' superiority in interpretability for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP is a multimodal deep learning framework that adapts CLIP with temporal integration and domain-specific strategies for cattle behavior recognition, achieving 96.1% accuracy on six indoor behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cattle behavior monitoring is crucial for animal health and productivity, but existing methods face challenges with domain gaps between pre-trained models and real-world surveillance footage, especially in data-scarce scenarios.

Method: Adapted CLIP model with temporal integration module, tailored data augmentation, and specialized text prompts to bridge domain gap between web data and cattle surveillance footage.

Result: Achieved 96.1% overall accuracy across six behaviors in supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding, drinking and standing-ruminating. Demonstrated robust generalization in few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Cattle-CLIP shows strong potential for multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behavior analysis, particularly effective for data-scarce behavior recognition tasks in livestock monitoring.

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) for photon-efficient 3D reconstruction in LOS and NLOS imaging, with specialized attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal transient measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in 3D reconstruction from transient measurements due to low quantum efficiency of sensors and high noise levels, especially for long-range or complex scenes.

Method: Develops TRT architecture with spatio-temporal self-attention encoders for local/global correlations and cross-attention decoders for feature integration. Creates TRT-LOS and TRT-NLOS variants for specific imaging tasks.

Result: Both TRT-LOS and TRT-NLOS significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic and real-world data from different imaging systems. Also contributes new datasets including large-scale synthetic LOS data and real-world NLOS measurements.

Conclusion: TRT provides a generic and effective solution for photon-efficient 3D reconstruction in time-resolved imaging systems, with demonstrated superiority over existing approaches.

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVI generates infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency and controllable storylines by using Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, which trains the model to identify and correct its own errors through closed-loop recycling of self-generated errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing long-video methods are limited to single-prompt extrapolation with repetitive scenes due to accumulated errors and the discrepancy between training on clean data and testing on self-generated outputs.

Method: Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning that injects historical errors into clean inputs, approximates predictions with one-step bidirectional integration, calculates errors with residuals, and dynamically banks errors into replay memory for resampling.

Result: SVI scales videos from seconds to infinite durations without additional inference cost, maintaining compatibility with diverse conditions like audio, skeleton, and text streams, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: SVI effectively bridges the training-testing gap in autoregressive video generation by learning from self-generated errors, enabling infinite-length video generation with high consistency and controllability.

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

TL;DR: TEMA-LLM is a cross-domain sequential recommendation framework that uses LLMs for semantic tag generation and multi-attention mechanisms to capture both domain-specific and cross-domain user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cross-domain sequential recommendation by better capturing domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns for personalized consumer experiences in e-commerce platforms.

Method: Uses LLMs to generate descriptive tags from item metadata, fuses tag embeddings with item identifiers and features, and employs a Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention mechanism to model user preferences across domains.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four large-scale e-commerce datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for advancing intelligent, user-centric recommendation systems in consumer electronics through semantic enrichment and cross-domain modeling.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

TL;DR: This paper proposes HMVDx, a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework using Multimodal Large Language Models for low-cost shoulder disorder diagnosis from consumer-grade videos, achieving 79.6% accuracy improvement over direct video diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of early and accurate diagnosis of shoulder disorders in regions with scarce medical resources by developing low-cost, scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions using consumer-grade devices.

Method: Proposes HMVDx framework that divides action understanding and disease diagnosis tasks between two MLLMs, using videos from consumer-grade devices and introducing a novel Usability Index metric based on medical decision-making logic.

Result: HMVDx achieved 79.6% improvement in diagnostic accuracy for shoulder joint injuries compared to direct video diagnosis methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant potential for low-cost MLLM applications in medical diagnostics, particularly valuable for underserved regions with limited medical resources.

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

*Alina Elena Baia,Alessio Xompero,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs lag behind specialized models in image privacy prediction accuracy despite being more resource-intensive, though they show higher robustness to image perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation comparing large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against specialized models for image privacy prediction, and determine if the trend toward generic VLMs is justified.

Method: Established a zero-shot benchmark for image privacy classification and evaluated top-3 open-source VLMs using task-aligned prompts, comparing their performance, efficiency, and robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.

Result: VLMs currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy prediction accuracy despite their higher parameter count and slower inference, but exhibit higher robustness to image perturbations.

Conclusion: The current trend favoring generic VLMs over specialized models for image privacy prediction may be premature, as purpose-built models still achieve better accuracy despite VLMs' advantages in robustness.

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

### [171] [Hallucination Filtering in Radiology Vision-Language Models Using Discrete Semantic Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09256)
*Patrick Wienholt,Sophie Caselitz,Robert Siepmann,Philipp Bruners,Keno Bressem,Christiane Kuhl,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Sven Nebelung,Daniel Truhn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to filter out high-entropy questions significantly improves accuracy of black-box vision-language models in radiologic VQA by detecting and rejecting hallucination-prone queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of black-box vision-language models in radiologic image-based visual question answering by detecting and filtering out questions likely to generate hallucinations.

Method: Evaluated DSE on two datasets using GPT-4o and GPT-4.1. Generated multiple answers per question with temperature 1.0, grouped meaning-equivalent responses using bidirectional entailment, computed DSE from semantic cluster frequencies, and filtered questions with DSE > 0.3 or > 0.6.

Result: After filtering high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy improved from 51.7% to 76.3% for GPT-4o (retaining 334/706 questions) and from 54.8% to 63.8% for GPT-4.1 (retaining 499/706 questions), both statistically significant (p < .001).

Conclusion: DSE enables reliable hallucination detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency, significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy, and offers a practical filtering strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for Referring Video Object Segmentation that jointly optimizes temporal sentence grounding and segmentation, using moment-centric sampling and bidirectional anchor-updated propagation for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for RefVOS either use handcrafted heuristics that miss temporal cues or external keyframe models that increase system complexity.

Method: Joint optimization of TSG and RefVOS with FIND token for key moment identification, moment-centric sampling strategy, and bidirectional anchor-updated propagation for stable tracking.

Result: The framework naturally incorporates key moment grounding capability and provides high-quality mask initialization while mitigating accumulated errors.

Conclusion: Proposed unified framework effectively addresses temporal reasoning and visual comprehension challenges in RefVOS through integrated temporal sentence grounding and optimized sampling strategies.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

### [173] [Spotlight on Token Perception for Multimodal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09285)
*Siyuan Huang,Xiaoye Qu,Yafu Li,Yun Luo,Zefeng He,Daizong Liu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VPPO is a novel policy gradient algorithm that leverages token perception to enhance multimodal reasoning in LVLMs by focusing on visually-dependent tokens and reweighting trajectory advantages based on visual dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods neglect the role of visual perception in optimization, despite its critical importance for multimodal reasoning in LVLMs.

Method: Proposes Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO) which uses token perception analysis to identify visually-dependent tokens, reweights trajectory advantages by visual dependency, and focuses policy updates on perceptually pivotal tokens.

Result: VPPO achieves substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models across eight perception and reasoning benchmarks, with consistent effectiveness at 7B and 32B model scales.

Conclusion: The work establishes a token-level perceptual perspective for analyzing multimodal RLVR and presents an effective optimization strategy to significantly enhance LVLMs' multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

*Tejaswi V. Panchagnula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human visual gaze follows Levy walk dynamics similar to animal foraging, optimized for efficient information gathering in visual environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the spatiotemporal statistics of human eye movements and explore whether visual gaze follows similar dynamics as animal foraging behavior, which has broad applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces.

Method: Conducted a large-scale experiment with 40 participants viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4 million gaze points using high-speed eye tracking. Analyzed gaze trajectory statistics and trained a CNN to predict fixation heatmaps from image input alone.

Result: Human gaze trajectory follows a Levy walk pattern similar to animal foraging, suggesting optimal efficiency in visual information gathering. The CNN model successfully reproduced salient fixation regions across novel images, demonstrating that key gaze behavior components are learnable from visual structure.

Conclusion: Human visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging, opening new avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

*Yuying Li,Siyi Qian,Hao Liang,Leqi Zheng,Ruichuan An,Yongzhen Guo,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapGeo is a caption-assisted reasoning framework that converts geometric diagrams into text captions to improve MLLMs' geometric reasoning, achieving substantial performance gains (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-72B from 8.6% to 59.0%). The paper also introduces CapGeo-Bench, a benchmark with 4,641 figure-caption pairs and keypoint-based evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric reasoning remains a major challenge for MLLMs, with advanced systems like GPT-O3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggling despite strong textual reasoning abilities. The bottleneck appears to be understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself, suggesting that converting visual content to textual captions could bridge this gap.

Method: Introduces CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that converts geometric diagrams into concise textual descriptions. Also proposes CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated figure-caption pairs with a keypoint-based evaluation metric that correlates with downstream performance.

Result: Substantial improvements when models use captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improved from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, Claude-Opus-4 from 44.8% to 73.0%. The keypoint-based evaluation metric strongly correlates with downstream CapGeo performance.

Conclusion: The framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway for advancing geometric reasoning in MLLMs by bridging visual and textual modalities through geometric captioning, addressing the core challenge of understanding geometric diagrams.

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid-depth is a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework that integrates CLIP and DINO foundation models to extract semantic-spatial knowledge through contrastive language guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on KITTI benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation approaches suffer from insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge extraction, limiting their performance.

Method: Proposes a coarse-to-fine progressive learning framework: 1) Aggregates multi-grained features from CLIP (global semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language guidance with a proxy task for depth-aware feature alignment; 2) Integrates camera pose information and pixel-wise language alignment to refine depth predictions as a plug-and-play module for existing MDE pipelines.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI benchmark demonstrate significant performance improvements across all metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, with benefits for downstream tasks like BEV perception.

Conclusion: The integration of CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details through language guidance effectively addresses feature granularity mismatches and enhances continuous depth estimation performance.

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

TL;DR: IRCR-Net is a semi-supervised method for nuclei instance segmentation that uses instance-aware consistency regularization and morphological priors to reduce pseudo-label noise and improve performance, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High annotation costs and data scarcity limit fully supervised methods, while existing semi-supervised approaches fail to regularize instance-level consistency, lack pathological structure priors, and introduce noisy pseudo-labels during training.

Method: Proposes IRCR-Net with Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms, incorporating morphological prior knowledge to assess pseudo-label quality and discard low-quality predictions.

Result: Significantly enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across multiple public datasets, even surpassing fully supervised methods in some scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed instance-aware robust consistency regularization effectively addresses limitations of existing semi-supervised methods for nuclei segmentation, demonstrating superior performance through proper pseudo-label quality assessment and morphological prior utilization.

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Progressive Prompt Fusion Network (PPFN) with Selective Progressive Training (SPT) is proposed for thermal infrared image enhancement, addressing coupled degradations through adaptive prompt guidance and achieving 8.76% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing infrared enhancement methods focus on individual degradations and struggle with coupled degradations, while all-in-one RGB methods are ineffective due to different imaging models. Thermal infrared image enhancement remains underexplored.

Method: PPFN establishes prompt pairs based on thermal imaging process and fuses them to modulate features for specific degradations. SPT mechanism gradually refines handling of composite cases through progressive training.

Result: The approach delivers promising visual results under specific degradation and significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes with 8.76% improvement. A new high-quality infrared benchmark is introduced.

Conclusion: The proposed PPFN with SPT effectively handles coupled degradations in thermal infrared images, providing adaptive guidance for enhancement while preserving structural details and improving contrast.

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

### [180] [Boosting Multi-modal Keyphrase Prediction with Dynamic Chain-of-Thought in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09358)
*Qihang Ma,Shengyu Li,Jie Tang,Dingkang Yang,Shaodong Chen,Yingyi Zhang,Chao Feng,Jiao Ran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using vision-language models for multi-modal keyphrase prediction, addressing limitations of traditional approaches through zero-shot, supervised fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and dynamic CoT strategies to improve reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-modal approaches have limitations in handling absence and unseen scenarios, and existing benchmarks overestimate model capability due to training-test overlap.

Method: Leverage VLMs with zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning, then use Fine-tune-CoT with high-quality reasoning data, and propose dynamic CoT to adaptively inject reasoning data during training.

Result: Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies successfully enhance VLMs for multi-modal keyphrase prediction, with dynamic CoT addressing the 'overthinking' phenomenon and improving reasoning flexibility.

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

*Junyan Ye,Dongzhi Jiang,Jun He,Baichuan Zhou,Zilong Huang,Zhiyuan Yan,Hongsheng Li,Conghui He,Weijia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice is a vision-centric reasoning benchmark that challenges MLLMs to perform fine-grained visual reasoning without relying on external knowledge, moving beyond shallow perception to require analytical observation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning benchmarks primarily assess language-based reasoning and treat visual input as replaceable context, creating a gap in evaluating true vision-centric reasoning capabilities.

Method: The benchmark integrates three components: seven types of visual challenges, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce visual reliance, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning process.

Result: BLINK-Twice poses significant challenges to current MLLMs, with 20 leading models struggling. While language-based reasoning strategies can improve performance, they often result in unstable reasoning. Repeated image observation and active visual interaction show promise.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals limitations in current MLLMs' vision reasoning capabilities and highlights the need for new paradigms that better integrate visual processing with reasoning, rather than relying on language-based reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

### [182] [Visibility-Aware Densification for 3D Gaussian Splatting in Dynamic Urban Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09364)
*Yikang Zhang,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAD-GS is a 3D Gaussian splatting framework that addresses geometry recovery in challenging urban scenes by identifying unreliable structures, selecting diverse views, and recovering missing geometry through multi-view stereo reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3DGS depends heavily on quality point cloud initialization and overlapping camera frustums, which are often unavailable in unbounded, dynamic urban environments, leading to distortions and artifacts when training with partially initialized point clouds.

Method: The method identifies unreliable geometry via voxel-based visibility reasoning, selects informative views through diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures using patch matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction to generate new Gaussian primitives.

Result: Extensive experiments on Waymo and nuScenes datasets show VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches and significantly improves reconstructed geometry quality for both static and dynamic objects.

Conclusion: VAD-GS effectively addresses the limitations of traditional 3DGS in challenging urban environments by enabling geometry recovery even in regions lacking initial points, demonstrating superior performance in reconstructing complex scenes.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Minkowski-MambaNet is a deep learning framework that directly estimates forest volume and biomass from raw LiDAR data by integrating Mamba's Selective State Space Model with Minkowski networks to capture long-range dependencies for better tree differentiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring, but directly estimating woody volume and AGB from LiDAR point clouds is challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to distinguish trees.

Method: Proposes Minkowski-MambaNet that integrates Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM) into a Minkowski network to encode global context and long-range dependencies, with skip connections to enhance features and accelerate convergence.

Conclusion: This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.

incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust

### [184] [Utilizing dynamic sparsity on pretrained DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09380)
*Reza Sedghi,Anand Subramoney,David Kappel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two methods to exploit sparsity in DETR's MLP layers for efficient inference: SIBS (static heuristic) and MGS (dynamic gating), with MGS achieving 85-95% sparsity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models like DETR face efficiency challenges in vision tasks, particularly due to computational demands during inference.

Method: Two approaches: SIBS (static indicator-based sparsification using fixed patterns) and MGS (micro-gated sparsification with lightweight dynamic gating trained on pretrained DETR).

Result: MGS achieves 85-95% activation sparsity on COCO dataset while maintaining or improving performance, significantly reducing computation.

Conclusion: MGS provides a practical, input-adaptive sparsification method that enables efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers without full retraining.

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

*Jin-Chuan Shi,Chengye Su,Jiajun Wang,Ariel Shamir,Miao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mono4DEditor is a framework for text-driven 4D scene editing that enables precise semantic editing of dynamic scenes reconstructed from monocular videos while preserving unedited content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Editing 4D scenes from monocular videos based on text prompts is valuable for content creation but challenging due to the need for precise semantic edits in localized regions of complex dynamic scenes while maintaining integrity of unedited content.

Method: Augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features for language-embedded dynamic representation, uses two-stage point-level localization (CLIP similarity selection + spatial refinement), and applies diffusion-based video editing with flow and scribble guidance for spatial fidelity and temporal coherence.

Result: Enables high-quality text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, preserving appearance and geometry of unedited areas, and surpasses prior approaches in flexibility and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor provides an effective solution for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing, addressing the challenges of precise semantic localization and temporal coherence in dynamic scene editing.

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DWTA-Net is a two-stage framework for low-light video enhancement that jointly exploits short- and long-term temporal cues to effectively suppress noise and artifacts in real-world low-light videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based approaches for low-light video enhancement struggle with heavy noise in real scenes due to limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage I uses Visual State-Space blocks for multi-frame alignment to recover brightness, color, and structure. Stage II employs recurrent refinement with dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow to balance static and dynamic regions, plus a texture-adaptive loss for detail preservation.

Result: Experiments on real-world low-light videos show DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DWTA-Net successfully addresses the challenge of heavy noise in low-light video enhancement by effectively leveraging both short- and long-term temporal information through its two-stage architecture.

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SilvaScenes is a new dataset for tree species instance segmentation from under-canopy images, collected across 5 bioclimatic domains in Quebec with 1476 trees from 24 species. Benchmarking shows tree segmentation works well (67.65% mAP) but species classification remains challenging (35.69% mAP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics for forest management needs better perception in complex natural environments with occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation. Existing datasets are inadequate as they focus on urban settings or limited species.

Method: Created SilvaScenes dataset with under-canopy images across 5 bioclimatic domains in Quebec, featuring 1476 trees from 24 species with expert annotations. Benchmarked modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation.

Result: Tree segmentation achieved 67.65% mAP, showing it's relatively easy. Species classification only reached 35.69% mAP, indicating it remains a significant challenge despite using modern deep learning methods.

Conclusion: SilvaScenes provides a valuable benchmark for forest perception systems. While tree detection works reasonably well, fine-grained species classification in natural forest environments remains an open challenge that requires further research.

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

*Jisu Han,Wonjun Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes dimensional entropy maximization to improve calibration in test-time prompt tuning for Vision-Language Models by addressing modality gap issues caused by dominant feature dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from modality gaps where single dominant feature dimensions across modalities degrade calibration performance during test-time adaptation, limiting their reliability in real-world deployment.

Method: Proposes dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes textual feature distributions toward uniformity to reduce dependency on dominant dimensions and mitigate modality gap issues.

Result: The method alleviates calibration performance degradation in test-time prompt tuning, enhancing the reliability of VLMs for real-world applications.

Conclusion: Dimensional entropy maximization offers a simple yet effective solution to improve VLM calibration by addressing dominant dimension dependencies in test-time adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The audiovisual industry needs to produce virtually unlimited novel characters while preserving artistic style and shared visual traits from small sets of human-designed references, broadening creative possibilities in animation and gaming.

Method: Adapts DreamBooth fine-tuning with multi-token strategy using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual characters and collective style, combined with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Removes class-specific regularization and introduces random tokens/embeddings during generation.

Result: Evaluated on five small specialized datasets, the approach produces high-quality, diverse characters while preserving distinctive aesthetic features of reference characters, with human evaluation confirming effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates potential for unlimited character creation while preserving learned style, offering significant creative possibilities for animation and gaming industries.

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a standardized evaluation framework for interactive medical image segmentation to address inconsistent evaluation practices, and evaluates state-of-the-art algorithms across diverse clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for interactive medical image segmentation are inconsistent and clinically unrealistic, hindering fair algorithm comparison and misrepresenting real-world performance.

Method: Developed a clinically grounded methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software framework for standardized evaluation pipelines to assess state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous tasks.

Result: Key findings: minimizing information loss in user interactions is critical for robustness; adaptive-zooming boosts robustness and convergence; performance drops when validation differs from training; 2D methods work well with slab-like images but 3D helps with large/irregular targets; non-medical models degrade with poor contrast and complex shapes.

Conclusion: Standardized evaluation is essential for fair comparison of interactive segmentation algorithms, and the proposed framework reveals important insights about algorithm performance across diverse clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

TL;DR: PhysToolBench is the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of physical tools through a VQA dataset with 1,000+ image-text pairs, testing tool recognition, understanding, and creation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify MLLMs' true understanding of physical tools, which is essential for general-purpose intelligent agents to achieve true versatility in interacting with the physical world.

Method: Created a Visual Question Answering dataset with three difficulty levels: Tool Recognition (identifying function), Tool Understanding (grasping operational principles), and Tool Creation (fashioning new tools from available objects).

Result: Evaluation of 32 MLLMs revealed significant deficiencies in tool understanding across proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and VLA backbone models.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have substantial gaps in physical tool comprehension, highlighting the need for improved benchmarks and solutions to advance true tool understanding capabilities.

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

TL;DR: Samsung smartphone images show diagonal artifacts affecting PRNU-based camera verification, but raw images bypass this issue. Artifacts can also be used forensically for HDR and portrait-mode analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate diagonal artifacts in Samsung smartphone images and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification, particularly addressing fingerprint collisions and forensic limitations.

Method: Analyzed images from Galaxy S and A series models, compared PRNU verification with and without raw capture in PRO mode, and explored forensic applications of the artifacts.

Result: Galaxy S models share common patterns causing fingerprint collisions; raw images bypass artifact pipeline; artifacts can help reduce HDR misdetections and localize synthetic bokeh regions.

Conclusion: PRNU verification remains reliable with raw images, but artifacts pose challenges for mid-range models and forensic cases without raw access, though artifacts themselves have forensic utility.

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

*PeiHuang Zheng,Yunlong Zhao,Zheng Cui,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRNet is a real-time detection framework that preserves primitive shallow spatial features to enhance small object detection in aerial images, addressing information degradation through Progressive Refinement Neck and Enhanced SliceSamp modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations, where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic information, leading to frequent misses and false positives.

Method: PRNet uses two modules: Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and Enhanced SliceSamp (ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized rearrangement and convolution.

Result: Extensive experiments on VisDrone, AI-TOD, and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: PRNet effectively addresses the limitations of existing FPN-based methods by prioritizing preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial features, enabling better small object detection in aerial imagery.

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior

### [194] [FLOWING: Implicit Neural Flows for Structure-Preserving Morphing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09537)
*Arthur Bizzi,Matias Grynberg,Vitor Matias,Daniel Perazzo,João Paulo Lima,Luiz Velho,Nuno Gonçalves,João Pereira,Guilherme Schardong,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLOWING is a novel morphing framework that models warping as differential vector flows, ensuring continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence without costly regularizations, achieving state-of-the-art morphing quality for 2D images and 3D shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MLP-based implicit neural representations for morphing require expensive regularizations that lead to unstable training and poor feature alignment. There's a need for a more principled approach that naturally ensures smooth and coherent transformations.

Method: Recasts warping as construction of differential vector flows, encoding structural flow properties directly into network architectures to ensure continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster convergence across various applications including face/image morphing and Gaussian Splatting morphing, enabling accurate and structure-preserving transformations.

Conclusion: FLOWING provides a principled flow-centric approach that overcomes limitations of standard MLP-based morphing methods, delivering stable training and high-quality results without requiring costly regularizations.

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

*Minkyoung Cho,Ruben Ohana,Christian Jacobsen,Adityan Jothi,Min-Hung Chen,Z. Morley Mao,Ethem Can*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TC-LoRA introduces dynamic, context-aware control in diffusion models by conditioning model weights directly through time-modulated LoRA adapters, improving generative fidelity and spatial condition adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models use static conditioning strategies that modify intermediate activations, limiting adaptation to the dynamic multi-stage denoising process from coarse structure to fine detail.

Method: Uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each diffusion step based on time and user conditions, enabling explicit adaptive conditioning strategies.

Result: Significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to spatial conditions compared to static activation-based methods across various data domains.

Conclusion: TC-LoRA establishes an alternative approach where conditioning strategy is modified through deeper functional adaptation of weights, allowing control to align with dynamic task demands and generative stages.

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSP-DETR is a unified detection framework for biomedical settings that enables few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen tasks within a single model, outperforming prior methods especially in low-shot and open-set scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection in biomedical settings faces challenges due to scarce labeled data and frequent emergence of novel or rare categories, requiring robust few-shot detection and open-set recognition capabilities.

Method: Built on class-agnostic DETR backbone, constructs class prototypes from support images, learns embedding space using augmented views and lightweight transformer decoder, with joint optimization of prototype matching loss, alignment-based separation loss, and KL divergence regularization.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors across ova, blood cell, and malaria detection tasks, especially in low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Conclusion: FSP-DETR provides a unified framework that enables inference-time flexibility for unseen class recognition, background rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining, addressing key challenges in biomedical object detection.

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

*Fengming Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of research trends in computer vision and machine learning conferences (CVPR, ICLR, NeurIPS) from 2023-2025, identifying major shifts toward multimodal vision-language models, generative methods, and 3D/video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide transparent, reproducible measurement of evolving research trends across major AI conferences, enabling better understanding of field evolution and identifying emerging directions.

Method: Analyzed 26,104 accepted papers by normalizing titles/abstracts, using phrase-protected matching against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign topical labels and extract fine-grained information about tasks, architectures, training methods, objectives, datasets, and modalities.

Result: Identified three major trends: (1) rapid growth of multimodal vision-language-LLM work reframing perception as instruction following; (2) expansion of generative methods focusing on diffusion controllability; (3) resilient 3D/video activity with shift to Gaussian splatting. Also found VLMs dominated by parameter-efficient adaptation and training shifts from scratch to fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The study reveals consistent longitudinal patterns across venues, with field moving toward multimodal systems, efficient adaptation methods, and practical training approaches. The released lexicon enables community auditing and extension of this analysis.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

*Peiwen Sun,Shiqiang Lang,Dongming Wu,Yi Ding,Kaituo Feng,Huadai Liu,Zhen Ye,Rui Liu,Yun-Hui Liu,Jianan Wang,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpaceVista-1M dataset and SpaceVista-7B model for all-scale spatial reasoning, addressing challenges in dataset curation and scale-aware modeling across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse applications like robotics and autonomous driving by overcoming reliance on indoor 3D scans, manual annotations, and lack of effective all-scale scene modeling.

Method: Developed a holistic solution with structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware modeling, and progressive training paradigm. Created SpaceVista-1M dataset (1M QA pairs from 38K video scenes across 5 scales) using automated pipeline, and built SpaceVista-7B model with scale-aware experts and progressive rewards.

Result: Extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance with strong generalization across all scales and scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses key challenges in spatial reasoning, providing comprehensive dataset, model, and benchmark for advancing all-scale spatial intelligence in MLLMs.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A distillation framework that equips vision-language models with action capabilities by transferring knowledge from small pretrained action models, achieving high success rates with reduced training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Vision-Language Action models from scratch is expensive, so the authors aim to leverage existing pretrained models through knowledge distillation to reduce costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) lightweight alignment mapping VLM states to action space of small action model, 2) selective fine-tuning of language model, state encoder, and action modules. Adds only action token and state encoder to original VLM structure.

Result: Achieved 97.3% average success rate on LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). Real-world experiments showed 82.0% success rate (17% improvement over teacher model).

Conclusion: Action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate precise actions while substantially reducing training costs, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

### [200] [StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09608)
*Ruyi Xu,Guangxuan Xiao,Yukang Chen,Liuning He,Kelly Peng,Yao Lu,Song Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingVLM enables real-time understanding of infinite video streams by maintaining a compact KV cache with attention sinks, recent vision tokens, and text tokens, trained via simple SFT on short video chunks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with infinite video streams due to quadratic computational costs from full attention and poor performance on long videos, while sliding window methods break coherence or have high latency.

Method: A unified framework aligning training with streaming inference, using a compact KV cache with attention sinks, recent vision tokens, and text tokens, trained via SFT on short overlapped video chunks to mimic inference patterns.

Result: Achieves 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini on Inf-Streams-Eval, maintains stable real-time performance at 8 FPS on H100, and improves VQA performance on LongVideoBench (+4.30) and OVOBench Realtime (+5.96).

Conclusion: StreamingVLM provides an effective solution for real-time infinite video understanding with stable performance and enhanced general VQA abilities through simple SFT training.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

*Graham Tierney,Srikar Katta,Christopher Bail,Sunshine Hillygus,Alexander Volfovsky*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new experimental design to estimate causal effects of text properties while avoiding overlap bias in LLM-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in studying humility's effect on political persuasion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of isolating causal effects of linguistic properties when text features are interlinked, avoiding latent confounding and overlap bias in LLM-based approaches.

Method: A new experimental design that handles latent confounding without inducing overlap bias, applied to study humility's effect on political communication persuasiveness.

Result: LLM-based methods performed worse than simple bag-of-words models; the new design successfully isolated the causal effect of expressing humility on perceived persuasiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed experimental design provides unbiased treatment effect estimates and offers insights for social media platforms, policymakers, and social scientists studying communication effects.

Abstract: Many social science questions ask how linguistic properties causally affect
an audience's attitudes and behaviors. Because text properties are often
interlinked (e.g., angry reviews use profane language), we must control for
possible latent confounding to isolate causal effects. Recent literature
proposes adapting large language models (LLMs) to learn latent representations
of text that successfully predict both treatment and the outcome. However,
because the treatment is a component of the text, these deep learning methods
risk learning representations that actually encode the treatment itself,
inducing overlap bias. Rather than depending on post-hoc adjustments, we
introduce a new experimental design that handles latent confounding, avoids the
overlap issue, and unbiasedly estimates treatment effects. We apply this design
in an experiment evaluating the persuasiveness of expressing humility in
political communication. Methodologically, we demonstrate that LLM-based
methods perform worse than even simple bag-of-words models using our real text
and outcomes from our experiment. Substantively, we isolate the causal effect
of expressing humility on the perceived persuasiveness of political statements,
offering new insights on communication effects for social media platforms,
policy makers, and social scientists.

TL;DR: HES-SQL is a hybrid training framework for Text-to-SQL generation that combines thinking-mode-fused supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization to improve both query accuracy and execution efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance Text-to-SQL generation by balancing semantic accuracy with computational efficiency, addressing the need for both correct and efficient database queries in natural language interfaces.

Method: Uses three innovations: skeleton-completeness scoring for preference alignment, query-latency-aware reward system for efficiency, and self-distillation for reasoning capability preservation. Combines SFT with GRPO for hybrid thinking models.

Result: Achieves 79.14% execution accuracy on BIRD and 54.9% on KaggleDBQA benchmarks, with 11-20% efficiency gains over supervised baselines. Demonstrates competitive performance on MySQL 8.0 and SQLite 3.42.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for Text-to-SQL systems that effectively balances accuracy with efficiency through execution-informed RL, with implications for robust natural language database interfaces and broader structured generation tasks.

Abstract: We present HES-SQL, a novel hybrid training framework that advances
Text-to-SQL generation through the integration of thinking-mode-fused
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).
Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a skeleton-completeness
scoring mechanism that enhances preference alignment between generated queries
and optimal SQL structures; (2) a query-latency-aware reward system that
incentivizes the generation of computationally efficient SQL queries; (3) a
self-distillation process for thinking-mode completion that prevents
degradation of the model's reasoning capabilities. This framework enables
hybrid thinking models to switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes
while improving SQL query accuracy and execution efficiency.
  Experimental evaluation, conducted on MySQL 8.0 and SQLite 3.42 under
controlled single-user conditions, demonstrates that HES-SQL achieves
competitive performance with execution accuracies of 79.14\% and 54.9\% on the
BIRD and KaggleDBQA benchmarks, respectively. Query latency is measured as the
end-to-end execution time of generated queries on the DBMS, averaged over
multiple runs to mitigate variance. Efficiency gains range from 11\% to 20\%
relative to supervised baselines. Our results establish a new paradigm for
Text-to-SQL systems that effectively balances semantic accuracy with
computational efficiency through execution-informed reinforcement learning
(RL). The proposed methodology has significant implications for developing
robust natural language interfaces to databases and can be extended to broader
structured generation tasks requiring both correctness and efficiency
optimization.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Spatio-temporal implicit neural representations combined with ADMM optimization and INCODE conditioning framework for dynamic X-ray CT reconstruction under interlaced acquisition, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating robustness to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address dynamic X-ray computed tomography reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes, overcoming challenges of global undersampling, spatial complexity, and noise.

Method: Combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE conditioning framework and implicit neural representations, with explicit noise modeling through weighted least squares data fidelity term.

Result: Outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR) across all settings, shows robustness to moderate noise, and achieves significant improvement in challenging regimes with explicit noise modeling.

Conclusion: The approach provides strong performance, modularity for practical applications including detector non-idealities modeling and ring artifact correction, and enables 4D volumetric reconstruction with potential for massive parallelization.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of spatio-temporalImplicit Neural
Representations (INRs) for dynamic X-ray computed tomography (XCT)
reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes. The proposed approach
combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework
incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our
method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global
undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and
noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and
outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a
state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the
inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels,
and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares
data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging
regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical
reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by
explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact
correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present
a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over
batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive
parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Evidential U-KAN, a trustworthy medical image segmentation method that integrates progressive evidence uncertainty guided attention (PEUA) and semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) to improve accuracy and reliability in challenging regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evidence deep learning methods for medical image segmentation often neglect using uncertainty maps to refine ambiguous boundary segmentation and suppress evidence of incorrect classes indiscriminately, which impairs uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas.

Method: Proposed PEUA mechanism progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps with low-rank learning to denoise attention weights, and SAEL strategy with semantic-smooth evidence generator and fidelity-enhancing regularization to retain critical semantics.

Result: Extensive experiments on 4 datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over competing methods.

Conclusion: Evidential U-KAN provides a novel solution for trustworthy medical image segmentation by effectively leveraging uncertainty guidance and preserving semantic information in challenging regions.

Abstract: Trustworthy medical image segmentation aims at deliver accurate and reliable
results for clinical decision-making. Most existing methods adopt the evidence
deep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and
theoretical robustness. However, the EDL-based methods often neglect leveraging
uncertainty maps rich in attention cues to refine ambiguous boundary
segmentation. To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty
guided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature
representation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA
progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank
learning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for
challenging regions. Concurrently, standard EDL methods suppress evidence of
incorrect class indiscriminately via Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization,
impairing the uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas and consequently
distorts the corresponding attention guidance. We thus introduce a
semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) strategy, integrating a
semantic-smooth evidence generator and a fidelity-enhancing regularization term
to retain critical semantics. Finally, by embedding PEUA and SAEL with the
state-of-the-art U-KAN, we proposes Evidential U-KAN, a novel solution for
trustworthy medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over the competing methods. The

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FS-RWKV is an efficient RWKV-based framework for synthesizing 7T-quality MRI images from 3T acquisitions, addressing computational limitations of existing methods while preserving anatomical details through frequency-spatial processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI provides superior image quality but has limited clinical adoption due to high costs and technical demands. Computational synthesis from more accessible 3T MRI offers a solution, but existing CNN and Transformer approaches have limitations in spatial coverage and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposed FS-RWKV framework with two key modules: FSO-Shift for discrete wavelet decomposition and omnidirectional spatial shifting to enhance global context while preserving high-frequency details, and SFEB for adaptive anatomical structure reinforcement through frequency-aware feature fusion.

Result: FS-RWKV consistently outperforms CNN-, Transformer-, GAN-, and RWKV-based baselines on UNC and BNU datasets across T1w and T2w modalities, achieving superior anatomical fidelity and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The FS-RWKV framework provides an efficient and effective solution for 3T-to-7T MRI synthesis, overcoming computational limitations of existing methods while maintaining high-quality anatomical detail preservation.

Abstract: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers enhanced spatial resolution and tissue
contrast that enables the detection of subtle pathological changes in
neurological disorders. However, the limited availability of 7T scanners
restricts widespread clinical adoption due to substantial infrastructure costs
and technical demands. Computational approaches for synthesizing 7T-quality
images from accessible 3T acquisitions present a viable solution to this
accessibility challenge. Existing CNN approaches suffer from limited spatial
coverage, while Transformer models demand excessive computational overhead.
RWKV architectures offer an efficient alternative for global feature modeling
in medical image synthesis, combining linear computational complexity with
strong long-range dependency capture. Building on this foundation, we propose
Frequency Spatial-RWKV (FS-RWKV), an RWKV-based framework for 3T-to-7T MRI
translation. To better address the challenges of anatomical detail preservation
and global tissue contrast recovery, FS-RWKV incorporates two key modules: (1)
Frequency-Spatial Omnidirectional Shift (FSO-Shift), which performs discrete
wavelet decomposition followed by omnidirectional spatial shifting on the
low-frequency branch to enhance global contextual representation while
preserving high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) Structural Fidelity
Enhancement Block (SFEB), a module that adaptively reinforces anatomical
structure through frequency-aware feature fusion. Comprehensive experiments on
UNC and BNU datasets demonstrate that FS-RWKV consistently outperforms existing
CNN-, Transformer-, GAN-, and RWKV-based baselines across both T1w and T2w
modalities, achieving superior anatomical fidelity and perceptual quality.

Motivation: Direct application of SAM2 to 3D medical images faces domain gaps: bidirectional anatomical continuity vs unidirectional video flow, and need for precise boundary delineation crucial for medical analysis.

Method: Proposes SAM2-3dMed with two innovations: Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP) module for bidirectional inter-slice dependencies, and Boundary Detection (BD) module for enhanced boundary accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments on MSD datasets (Lung, Spleen, Pancreas) show SAM2-3dMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation overlap and boundary precision.

Conclusion: The approach advances 3D medical image segmentation and provides a general paradigm for adapting video-centric foundation models to spatial volumetric data.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of 3D medical images is critical for clinical
applications like disease assessment and treatment planning. While the Segment
Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable success in video object
segmentation by leveraging temporal cues, its direct application to 3D medical
images faces two fundamental domain gaps: 1) the bidirectional anatomical
continuity between slices contrasts sharply with the unidirectional temporal
flow in videos, and 2) precise boundary delineation, crucial for morphological
analysis, is often underexplored in video tasks. To bridge these gaps, we
propose SAM2-3dMed, an adaptation of SAM2 for 3D medical imaging. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: 1) a Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP)
module explicitly models bidirectional inter-slice dependencies by guiding SAM2
to predict the relative positions of different slices in a self-supervised
manner; 2) a Boundary Detection (BD) module enhances segmentation accuracy
along critical organ and tissue boundaries. Extensive experiments on three
diverse medical datasets (the Lung, Spleen, and Pancreas in the Medical
Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset) demonstrate that SAM2-3dMed significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
segmentation overlap and boundary precision. Our approach not only advances 3D
medical image segmentation performance but also offers a general paradigm for
adapting video-centric foundation models to spatial volumetric data.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LODi is a framework that adapts adult brain MRI segmentation models to infant scans using transfer learning and domain adaptation, enabling accurate segmentation despite anatomical differences and limited labeled infant data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infant brain MRI segmentation is challenging due to evolving anatomy, motion artifacts, and scarce high-quality labeled data, while abundant adult brain MRI data is available.

Method: Pre-train on adult brain MRI data, then adapt to 0-2 year-olds using weakly supervised learning with FreeSurfer silver-standard labels, hierarchical feature refinement, and multi-level consistency constraints.

Result: Superior performance over traditional supervised learning and domain-specific models on internal and external datasets, enabling fast, accurate, age-adaptive segmentation while mitigating scanner biases.

Conclusion: Leveraging adult brain priors provides a foundation for age-flexible neuroimaging analysis, enabling more reliable and generalizable brain MRI segmentation across the lifespan.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is critical for studying early
neurodevelopment and diagnosing neurological disorders. Yet, it remains a
fundamental challenge due to continuously evolving anatomy of the subjects,
motion artifacts, and the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. In this work,
we present LODi, a novel framework that utilizes prior knowledge from an adult
brain MRI segmentation model to enhance the segmentation performance of infant
scans. Given the abundance of publicly available adult brain MRI data, we
pre-train a segmentation model on a large adult dataset as a starting point.
Through transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies, we progressively
adapt the model to the 0-2 year-old population, enabling it to account for the
anatomical and imaging variability typical of infant scans. The adaptation of
the adult model is carried out using weakly supervised learning on infant brain
scans, leveraging silver-standard ground truth labels obtained with FreeSurfer.
By introducing a novel training strategy that integrates hierarchical feature
refinement and multi-level consistency constraints, our method enables fast,
accurate, age-adaptive segmentation, while mitigating scanner and site-specific
biases. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional supervised
learning and domain-specific models. Our findings highlight the advantage of
leveraging adult brain priors as a foundation for age-flexible neuroimaging
analysis, paving the way for more reliable and generalizable brain MRI
segmentation across the lifespan.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support clinical and research applications by enabling high-fidelity brain tumor MRI inpainting and healthy tissue restoration through generative modeling.

Method: Latent diffusion model conditioned on both tissue segmentations and voxel-level continuous tumor concentrations to generate 3D spatially coherent and anatomically consistent images.

Result: Achieved PSNR of 18.5 for healthy tissue inpainting and 17.4 for tumor inpainting, demonstrating high-fidelity synthesis capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed generative model successfully performs both tumor synthesis and healthy tissue restoration tasks with high quality, as validated by PSNR metrics.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inpainting supports numerous clinical and
research applications. We introduce the first generative model that conditions
on voxel-level, continuous tumor concentrations to synthesize high-fidelity
brain tumor MRIs. For the BraTS 2025 Inpainting Challenge, we adapt this
architecture to the complementary task of healthy tissue restoration by setting
the tumor concentrations to zero. Our latent diffusion model conditioned on
both tissue segmentations and the tumor concentrations generates 3D spatially
coherent and anatomically consistent images for both tumor synthesis and
healthy tissue inpainting. For healthy inpainting, we achieve a PSNR of 18.5,
and for tumor inpainting, we achieve 17.4. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: MMAudioSep is a generative model for video/text-queried sound separation built on a pretrained video-to-audio model, achieving superior performance compared to existing separation models while retaining original generation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage knowledge from pretrained audio generative models for efficient training of sound separation models, avoiding the need to train from scratch.

Method: Fine-tunes a pretrained video-to-audio generative model for sound separation tasks, using video/text queries to separate audio sources.

Result: MMAudioSep outperforms existing deterministic and generative separation models in sound separation performance.

Conclusion: Foundational sound generation models can be effectively adapted for sound-related downstream tasks like separation while preserving their original generation capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce MMAudioSep, a generative model for video/text-queried sound
separation that is founded on a pretrained video-to-audio model. By leveraging
knowledge about the relationship between video/text and audio learned through a
pretrained audio generative model, we can train the model more efficiently,
i.e., the model does not need to be trained from scratch. We evaluate the
performance of MMAudioSep by comparing it to existing separation models,
including models based on both deterministic and generative approaches, and
find it is superior to the baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
even after acquiring functionality for sound separation via fine-tuning, the
model retains the ability for original video-to-audio generation. This
highlights the potential of foundational sound generation models to be adopted
for sound-related downstream tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ControlAudio is a progressive diffusion approach for controllable text-to-audio generation that integrates text, timing, and phoneme features through multi-task learning and step-by-step conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing controllable TTA generation methods suffer from data scarcity and compromised performance at scale, limiting fine-grained control over timing and speech content.

Method: Progressive diffusion modeling with: 1) Data construction via annotation and simulation, 2) Pretraining DiT on text-audio pairs then incrementally integrating timing and phoneme features, 3) Progressively guided inference aligning with DiT's coarse-to-fine sampling.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in temporal accuracy and speech clarity, significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: ControlAudio effectively addresses data scarcity in controllable TTA generation through progressive multi-task learning and achieves superior fine-grained control over audio generation.

Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) generation with fine-grained control signals, e.g.,
precise timing control or intelligible speech content, has been explored in
recent works. However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation
performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast
controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a
progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits
distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text,
timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we
propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation,
augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme.
Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT)
on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then
incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic
representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we
propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more
fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling
nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity,
significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective
evaluations. Demo samples are available at:

### [211] [Generating Sizing Fields for Mesh Generation via GCN-based Simplification of Adaptive Background Grids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08645)
*Xunyang Zhu,Hongfei Ye,Yifei Wang,Taoran Liu,Jianjun Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper presents an adaptive background grid simplification (ABGS) framework using Graph Convolutional Networks to optimize unstructured mesh generation by reducing grid complexity while maintaining geometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating optimal background grids for unstructured mesh generation is challenging due to requirements for geometric conformity, computational efficiency, and artifact-free results. Traditional methods face difficulties in balancing these competing objectives.

Method: The framework reformulates grid simplification as an edge score regression problem using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). It employs a custom loss function that considers both geometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy, replacing costly procedural evaluations.

Result: The method achieves 74%-94% element reduction in background grids and reduces sizing field query times by 35%-88% across diverse engineering models, demonstrating significant computational efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: The ABGS framework provides an effective data-driven solution for background grid simplification, enabling faster mesh generation while maintaining quality through intelligent edge collapse prediction using GCNs.

Abstract: The sizing field defined on a triangular background grid is pivotal for
controlling the quality and efficiency of unstructured mesh generation.
However, creating an optimal background grid that is geometrically conforming,
computationally lightweight, and free from artifacts like banding is a
significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel, adaptive background grid
simplification (ABGS) framework based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).
We reformulate the grid simplification task as an edge score regression problem
and train a GCN model to efficiently predict optimal edge collapse candidates.
The model is guided by a custom loss function that holistically considers both
geometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy. This data-driven approach
replaces a costly procedural evaluation, accelerating the simplification
process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
across diverse and complex engineering models. Compared to the initial dense
grids, our simplified background grids achieve an element reduction of 74%-94%,
leading to a 35%-88% decrease in sizing field query times.

Motivation: Address challenges in AI-driven 3D generation: achieving smooth surfaces and reducing storage overhead while maintaining model quality.

Method: Multi-stage framework with parameterized primitive-based generation algorithm that identifies shape features and replaces model elements with high-quality surface primitives, plus corresponding storage method.

Result: Achieved Chamfer Distance 0.003092, VIoU 0.545, F1-Score 0.9139, NC 0.8369 with primitive parameter files ~6KB in size on virtual and real scene datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively generates 3D models with smooth surfaces and minimal storage, particularly suitable for rapid prototyping of simple models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI-driven 3D model generation have leveraged cross
modality, yet generating models with smooth surfaces and minimizing storage
overhead remain challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage framework
for generating 3D models composed of parameterized primitives, guided by
textual and image inputs. In the framework, A model generation algorithm based
on parameterized primitives, is proposed, which can identifies the shape
features of the model constituent elements, and replace the elements with
parameterized primitives with high quality surface. In addition, a
corresponding model storage method is proposed, it can ensure the original
surface quality of the model, while retaining only the parameters of
parameterized primitives. Experiments on virtual scene dataset and real scene
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a Chamfer
Distance of 0.003092, a VIoU of 0.545, a F1-Score of 0.9139 and a NC of 0.8369,
with primitive parameter files approximately 6KB in size. Our approach is

*Rui Hu,Delai Qiu,Yining Wang,Shengping Liu,Jitao Sang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: VAPO is a reinforcement learning method that improves speech recognition in academic lectures by enforcing structured visual reasoning from presentation slides, preventing degeneration into simple OCR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with domain-specific terminology in academic lectures, and existing methods are either complex pipelines or OLLMs that degenerate into basic OCR without proper visual reasoning.

Method: Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO) uses reinforcement learning to enforce a structured "Look before Transcription" process with <think><answer> format, where the model first performs OCR on slides then generates transcriptions using that visual information.

Result: VAPO significantly improves recognition of domain-specific terms and establishes an effective end-to-end paradigm for SlideASR, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on the new SlideASR-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: VAPO provides a novel post-training method that successfully controls model reasoning to leverage visual information from slides, overcoming the limitations of existing approaches and improving ASR performance in specialized domains.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often struggle with
domain-specific terminology, especially in specialized settings such as
academic lectures. To address this, we define the SlideASR task, which
leverages the rich visual information from presentation slides to improve
transcription accuracy. Existing pipeline methods for this task tend to be
complex and underperform. Although omni-modal large language models (OLLMs)
provide a promising end-to-end framework, they frequently fail in practice by
degenerating into simple optical character recognition (OCR) systems. To
overcome this, we propose Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a novel
post-training method designed to control the model's reasoning process. Drawing
on the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, VAPO enforces a structured "Look
before Transcription" procedure using a <think><answer> format. Specifically,
the model first performs OCR on the slide content within the think step, then
generates the transcription by referencing this recognized visual information
in the answer step. This reasoning process is optimized via reinforcement
learning with four distinct rewards targeting format compliance, OCR accuracy,
ASR quality, and visual anchoring consistency. To support further research, we
construct SlideASR-Bench, a new entity-rich benchmark consisting of a synthetic
dataset for training and testing, and a challenging real-world set for
evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VAPO significantly improves
recognition of domain-specific terms, establishing an effective end-to-end
paradigm for SlideASR.

*Ahmed Adel Attia,Jing Liu,Carol Espy Wilson*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes using articulatory features as both an auxiliary task and pseudo-input in deep learning ASR models, showing consistent improvements especially in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit articulatory features in modern deep learning ASR systems, as previous work was limited to shallow acoustic models and articulatory information was largely sidelined in recent ASR research.

Method: Uses speech inversion as auxiliary prediction task and injects predicted articulatory features as query stream in cross-attention module with acoustic embeddings as keys/values.

Result: Experiments on LibriSpeech show consistent improvements over strong transformer baselines, particularly under low-resource conditions.

Conclusion: Articulatory features can provide meaningful benefits when reintroduced with modern deep learning architectures, especially in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Prior works have investigated the use of articulatory features as
complementary representations for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but their
use was largely confined to shallow acoustic models. In this work, we revisit
articulatory information in the era of deep learning and propose a framework
that leverages articulatory representations both as an auxiliary task and as a
pseudo-input to the recognition model. Specifically, we employ speech inversion
as an auxiliary prediction task, and the predicted articulatory features are
injected into the model as a query stream in a cross-attention module with
acoustic embeddings as keys and values. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate
that our approach yields consistent improvements over strong transformer-based
baselines, particularly under low-resource conditions. These findings suggest
that articulatory features, once sidelined in ASR research, can provide
meaningful benefits when reintroduced with modern architectures.

*Vishakha Lall,Yisi Liu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes modeling stress as a temporally evolving phenomenon using dynamic labeling from emotional states and cross-attention sequential models, achieving significant accuracy improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work treats stress as static, but stress actually evolves over time and is influenced by historical emotional states, making dynamic modeling more appropriate for accurate detection.

Method: Dynamic labeling strategy that derives fine-grained stress annotations from emotional labels, and cross-attention-based sequential models (Unidirectional LSTM and Transformer Encoder) to capture temporal stress progression.

Result: Achieved notable accuracy gains: +5% on MuSE and +18% on StressID datasets over existing baselines, with good generalization to custom real-world dataset.

Conclusion: Modeling stress as a dynamic construct in speech provides significant value and improved detection performance compared to static approaches.

Abstract: Detecting psychological stress from speech is critical in high-pressure
settings. While prior work has leveraged acoustic features for stress
detection, most treat stress as a static label. In this work, we model stress
as a temporally evolving phenomenon influenced by historical emotional state.
We propose a dynamic labelling strategy that derives fine-grained stress
annotations from emotional labels and introduce cross-attention-based
sequential models, a Unidirectional LSTM and a Transformer Encoder, to capture
temporal stress progression. Our approach achieves notable accuracy gains on
MuSE (+5%) and StressID (+18%) over existing baselines, and generalises well to
a custom real-world dataset. These results highlight the value of modelling
stress as a dynamic construct in speech.

*Yaya Sy,Christophe Cerisara,Irina Illina*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A new pruning method for Whisper models in low-resource languages like Bambara that uses embedding compression and layer merging instead of vocabulary pruning, achieving 48% size reduction and 2.15x speedup while preserving 90% of original performance with only 32h of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods like Distill-Whisper require massive retraining data (21,000 hours) which is unavailable for most low-resource languages, making it challenging to deploy lightweight models on edge devices in data-scarce settings.

Method: Instead of vocabulary pruning (unsuitable due to code-switching), the approach uses low-rank decomposition and feature distillation for embedding compression, and layer merging rather than removal to limit performance loss.

Result: The final model achieves 48% smaller size and 2.15x faster inference on MacBook Air M1 while preserving 90% of the original Whisper model's performance, using only 32 hours of Bambara speech-to-text data.

Conclusion: The proposed pruning recipe enables effective model compression for low-resource languages with minimal data requirements, making Whisper models practical for edge deployment in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Pruning large pre-trained transformers for low-resource languages is
challenging, as it often requires massive retraining data to recover
performance. For instance, Distill-Whisper prunes Whisper by 40% and retrains
on 21,000 hours of speech, far beyond what is available for most languages. Can
Whisper be made lighter and faster for edge devices in data-scarce settings?
Focusing on Bambara with only 32h of speech-to-text data, we propose a new
pruning recipe. Instead of vocabulary pruning, which is unsuitable due to
frequent code-switching by Bambara speakers, we compress the embeddings with
low-rank decomposition and feature distillation. Rather than removing layers,
we merge them to limit performance loss. The final model preserves 90% of the
original performance while being 48% smaller and 2.15x faster on a MacBook Air
M1.

*Danel Adendorff,Simon Malan,Herman Kamper*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether performance limitations in zero-resource word segmentation and clustering come from word segment representations or clustering methods, finding that representation variability is the primary limiting factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems still produce imperfect lexicons, and to determine whether the main limitation lies in how word segments are represented or how they are clustered into word types.

Method: Combined various self-supervised speech features (continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods (K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data, using controlled experiments to isolate representation vs clustering effects.

Result: The best system uses graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features. Faster alternatives use graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged continuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences.

Conclusion: Representation variability across segments of the same word type -- rather than clustering methods -- is the primary factor limiting performance in zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems.

Abstract: Zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems aim to tokenise speech
into word-like units without access to text labels. Despite progress, the
induced lexicons are still far from perfect. In an idealised setting with gold
word boundaries, we ask whether performance is limited by the representation of
word segments, or by the clustering methods that group them into word-like
types. We combine a range of self-supervised speech features
(continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods
(K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data. The best
system uses graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features.
Faster alternatives use graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged
continuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences. Through
controlled experiments that isolate either the representations or the
clustering method, we demonstrate that representation variability across
segments of the same word type -- rather than clustering -- is the primary
factor limiting performance.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper addresses speaker anonymization in multi-speaker conversational audio, focusing on anonymizing only one target speaker while preserving others, with applications in call center privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speaker anonymization research focuses on single-speaker audio, but real-world scenarios like call centers require anonymizing only specific speakers in multi-speaker conversations, creating a significant gap in current methods and evaluation.

Method: The study explores effective strategies for targeted speaker anonymization in conversational audio, identifies problems in development, and proposes improved evaluation methodologies for multi-speaker scenarios.

Result: The research highlights the limitations of conventional anonymization methods for multi-speaker scenarios and demonstrates the inadequacy of current evaluation metrics for accurately assessing privacy protection and utility in complex conversational settings.

Conclusion: This work bridges important gaps in speaker anonymization by developing targeted approaches for multi-speaker conversational audio and proposing enhanced evaluation frameworks specifically designed for scenarios where only one speaker needs anonymization.

Abstract: Most of the existing speaker anonymization research has focused on
single-speaker audio, leading to the development of techniques and evaluation
metrics optimized for such condition. This study addresses the significant
challenge of speaker anonymization within multi-speaker conversational audio,
specifically when only a single target speaker needs to be anonymized. This
scenario is highly relevant in contexts like call centers, where customer
privacy necessitates anonymizing only the customer's voice in interactions with
operators. Conventional anonymization methods are often not suitable for this
task. Moreover, current evaluation methodology does not allow us to accurately
assess privacy protection and utility in this complex multi-speaker scenario.
This work aims to bridge these gaps by exploring effective strategies for
targeted speaker anonymization in conversational audio, highlighting potential
problems in their development and proposing corresponding improved evaluation
methodologies.

*Zirun Zhou,Zhengyang Xiao,Haochuan Xu,Jing Sun,Di Wang,Jingfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper reveals a practical security threat where attackers can manipulate vision-language-action models by injecting physical objects as triggers into training datasets, enabling goal-oriented backdoor attacks that execute predefined actions when triggers are present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models rely on uncurated training datasets which pose security risks. Current backdoor attacks require white-box access and cause task failures rather than enforcing specific actions, highlighting the need for more practical threat models.

Method: Proposes goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA) using physical triggers in training data. Introduces BadLIBERO dataset based on LIBERO benchmark, incorporating diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions with a three-level evaluation system.

Result: GoBA achieves 97% success rate in achieving backdoor goals when physical triggers are present, with zero performance degradation on clean inputs. Action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack performance, while trigger size has little effect.

Conclusion: Physical object injection poses a serious security threat to VLA models, enabling practical backdoor attacks that remain undetected during normal operation but execute malicious actions when triggers are present.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved
embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and
perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets
raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly
assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing
specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers
can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the
training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the
VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes
predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers.
Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO
that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions.
In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim
VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and
success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to
successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the
physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on
clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that
the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack
performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and
BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at
https://goba-attack.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLMs are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks when interacting with external data sources, with well-known attack patterns still succeeding across various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs increasingly process sensitive corporate data through tool-calling and RAG, indirect prompt injection emerges as a critical attack vector that enables adversaries to exploit models through manipulated inputs.

Method: Systematic evaluation of indirect prompt injection attacks across diverse models, analyzing susceptibility based on parameters like model size, manufacturer, and specific implementations.

Result: Current LLMs remain highly susceptible to indirect prompt injection attacks, with well-known attack patterns continuing to succeed and exposing persistent weaknesses in model defenses.

Conclusion: Need for strengthened training procedures, centralized database of known attack vectors, and unified testing framework to integrate security into core LLM design, as current models fail to mitigate long-standing threats.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now routinely used to autonomously execute
complex tasks, from natural language processing to dynamic workflows like web
searches. The usage of tool-calling and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
allows LLMs to process and retrieve sensitive corporate data, amplifying both
their functionality and vulnerability to abuse. As LLMs increasingly interact
with external data sources, indirect prompt injection emerges as a critical and
evolving attack vector, enabling adversaries to exploit models through
manipulated inputs. Through a systematic evaluation of indirect prompt
injection attacks across diverse models, we analyze how susceptible current
LLMs are to such attacks, which parameters, including model size and
manufacturer, specific implementations, shape their vulnerability, and which
attack methods remain most effective. Our results reveal that even well-known
attack patterns continue to succeed, exposing persistent weaknesses in model
defenses. To address these vulnerabilities, we emphasize the need for
strengthened training procedures to enhance inherent resilience, a centralized
database of known attack vectors to enable proactive defense, and a unified
testing framework to ensure continuous security validation. These steps are
essential to push developers toward integrating security into the core design
of LLMs, as our findings show that current models still fail to mitigate
long-standing threats.

### [221] [When to Reason: Semantic Router for vLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08731)
*Chen Wang,Xunzhuo Liu,Yuhan Liu,Yue Zhu,Xiangxi Mo,Junchen Jiang,Huamin Chen*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: A semantic router that selectively applies reasoning modes to LLM queries based on their complexity, achieving significant improvements in accuracy while reducing latency and token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning modes in LLMs improve accuracy but incur high costs in latency and token usage, which are unnecessary for simple prompts, creating a need for selective reasoning application.

Method: Developed a semantic router that classifies queries by their reasoning requirements and applies reasoning modes only when beneficial.

Result: Achieved 10.2 percentage point accuracy improvement on MMLU-Pro benchmark while reducing latency by 47.1% and token consumption by 48.5% compared to direct inference with vLLM.

Conclusion: Semantic routing effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in open-source LLM serving systems by selectively applying reasoning only when needed.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial accuracy gains when
augmented with reasoning modes such as chain-of-thought and inference-time
scaling. However, reasoning also incurs significant costs in inference latency
and token usage, with environmental and financial impacts, which are
unnecessary for many simple prompts. We present a semantic router that
classifies queries based on their reasoning requirements and selectively
applies reasoning only when beneficial. Our approach achieves a 10.2 percentage
point improvement in accuracy on the MMLU-Pro benchmark while reducing response
latency by 47.1% and token consumption by 48.5% compared to direct inference
with vLLM. These results demonstrate that semantic routing offers an effective
mechanism for striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency in open-source
LLM serving systems

### [222] [Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models for the Machine-Assisted Resolution of User Intentions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08576)
*Justus Flerlage,Alexander Acker,Odej Kao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates open-source LLMs for local deployment in intent-based operating systems, comparing them against proprietary models like GPT-4 for workflow generation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM implementations rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which create privacy, autonomy, and scalability limitations. Local deployment is essential for robust and trusted language-first interaction paradigms.

Method: Comparative analysis of several open-source and open-access LLMs against OpenAI's GPT-4-based systems, assessing performance in generating workflows for various user intentions.

Result: The study provides empirical insights into the practical viability and performance trade-offs of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable components.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs show potential for enabling more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious user-device interaction through locally embedded intelligence, supporting decentralization and democratization of AI infrastructure.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural
language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as
translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex
workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional,
GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction
paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate
their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions
across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However,
extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which
introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For
language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface
paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative.
This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of
locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational
components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine
the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating
user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is
conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess
performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present
study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance
trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable
components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study
inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI
infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes
more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded
intelligence.

### [223] [BigCodeArena: Unveiling More Reliable Human Preferences in Code Generation via Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08697)
*Terry Yue Zhuo,Xiaolong Jin,Hange Liu,Juyong Jiang,Tianyang Liu,Chen Gong,Bhupesh Bishnoi,Vaisakhi Mishra,Marek Suppa,Noah Ziems,Saiteja Utpala,Ming Xu,Guangyu Song,Kaixin Li,Yuhan Cao,Bo Liu,Zheng Liu,Sabina Abdurakhmanova,Wenhao Yu,Mengzhao Jia,Jihan Yao,Kenneth Hamilton,Kumar Shridhar,Minh Chien Vu,Dingmin Wang,Jiawei Liu,Zijian Wang,Qian Liu,Binyuan Hui,Meg Risdal,Ahsen Khaliq,Atin Sood,Zhenchang Xing,Wasi Uddin Ahmad,John Grundy,David Lo,Banghua Zhu,Xiaoning Du,Torsten Scholak,Leandro von Werra*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BigCodeArena is a human evaluation platform for code generation that enables execution of LLM-generated code and human interaction with execution outcomes. It collected over 14,000 code conversations and identified 4,700 pairwise human preferences, leading to two benchmarks for systematic evaluation of LLM coding capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual evaluation of LLM-generated code is challenging due to the need to understand raw code and simulate execution. Existing platforms lack comprehensive execution environments for proper code quality assessment.

Method: Built on Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena provides on-the-fly execution environment for LLM-generated code across 10 languages and 8 execution environments. Collected 14,000+ code conversations and identified 4,700 pairwise human preferences.

Result: Analysis revealed underexplored LLM preferences in fine-grained domains. BigCodeReward benchmark showed LLMs perform better at judging coding preferences when execution results are available. AutoCodeArena benchmark found proprietary LLMs (GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Claude-Opus-4) lead in code generation performance.

Conclusion: BigCodeArena enables systematic evaluation of LLM coding capabilities through human feedback and automated benchmarks. Execution-aware evaluation is crucial for accurate assessment of code generation quality, with proprietary models currently leading the field.

Abstract: Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable
real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model
responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of
LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding
long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this
end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code
generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment.
Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of
LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and
outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions
across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution
environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700
multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers
underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by
tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding
and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based
on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For
BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the
consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows
that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the
execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose
AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding
quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation
performance among recent emerging models.

TL;DR: McMining is introduced as a task to mine programming misconceptions from student code samples, with a benchmark dataset and LLM-based approaches showing effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students often develop programming misconceptions that lead to bugs, inefficient code, and hinder learning of related concepts.

Method: Developed an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions with code samples, and introduced two LLM-based McMiner approaches using Gemini, Claude, and GPT models.

Result: Extensive evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.

Conclusion: LLM-based approaches can effectively mine programming misconceptions from student code samples, enabling better identification and remediation of learning gaps.

Abstract: When learning to code, students often develop misconceptions about various
programming language concepts. These can not only lead to bugs or inefficient
code, but also slow down the learning of related concepts. In this paper, we
introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples
of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining
systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together
with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We
then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive
evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are
effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.

### [225] [FreqCa: Accelerating Diffusion Models via Frequency-Aware Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08669)
*Jiacheng Liu,Peiliang Cai,Qinming Zhou,Yuqi Lin,Deyang Kong,Benhao Huang,Yupei Pan,Haowen Xu,Chang Zou,Junshu Tang,Shikang Zheng,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FreqCa is a frequency-aware caching method that reduces inference costs in diffusion transformers by reusing low-frequency features and predicting high-frequency ones with interpolation, achieving 99% memory reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature caching methods assume feature continuity across timesteps, but this doesn't always hold. Frequency analysis reveals different dynamics in low and high-frequency components, motivating a more nuanced approach.

Method: Proposes Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa) that reuses low-frequency features based on similarity and predicts high-frequency features using second-order Hermite interpolation. Also introduces caching Cumulative Residual Features (CRF) to reduce memory footprint.

Result: Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate effectiveness in both generation and editing tasks with significant memory reduction.

Conclusion: FreqCa successfully addresses inference cost issues in diffusion transformers by leveraging frequency-domain insights and achieves substantial memory savings while maintaining performance in generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on
GitHub.

*Motahare Mounesan,Sourya Saha,Houchao Gan,Md. Nurul Absur,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction in dynamic edge environments using cooperative Q-learning agents for camera and server selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is critical for edge applications like fire rescue, but dynamic edge resource availability causes disruptions that challenge reconstruction reliability.

Method: Two cooperative Q-learning agents for camera selection and server selection that operate online, learning policies through interactions with edge environment. Implemented on distributed testbed with lab devices and FABRIC infrastructure.

Result: Framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The RL-based framework enables reliable 3D reconstruction under resource-constrained and disruption-prone edge environments.

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

### [227] [The Boundaries of Fair AI in Medical Image Prognosis: A Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08840)
*Thai-Hoang Pham,Jiayuan Chen,Seungyeon Lee,Yuanlong Wang,Sayoko Moroi,Xueru Zhang,Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairTTE is the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event prediction in medical imaging, revealing pervasive bias across imaging modalities and limited effectiveness of current fairness methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in fairness research for medical prognosis scenarios, as most existing works focus only on medical image diagnosis tasks and overlook time-to-event prediction for disease progression outcomes.

Method: Developed FairTTE framework that integrates TTE prediction and fairness algorithms, uses causal analysis to uncover bias sources, and conducts large-scale evaluation across diverse imaging modalities and TTE outcomes.

Result: Found that bias is pervasive across different imaging modalities, current fairness methods offer limited mitigation, fairness becomes increasingly difficult under distribution shifts, and strong association exists between bias sources and model disparities.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need for more robust, equitable prognostic models and holistic approaches that target all forms of bias, as existing solutions have significant limitations in maintaining fairness under real-world conditions.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

*Ammar I Marvi,Nancy G Kanwisher,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sparse decomposition approach reveals distinct functional components across visual streams, with DNNs showing stronger alignment with ventral stream representations than dorsal or lateral streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the inconsistency between distinct functional processes in human visual streams and DNNs' ability to model the entire visual system with single-task training, suggesting common computational principles.

Method: Applied novel sparse decomposition to identify dominant visual components in each stream, then introduced Sparse Component Alignment (SCA) to measure representational alignment between brains and machines.

Result: Found clear differences in component profiles: ventral stream shows selectivity for faces, places, bodies, text, food; lateral stream for social interactions, motion, hand actions; dorsal stream has less interpretable components. DNNs are more aligned with ventral than dorsal/lateral representations.

Conclusion: SCA provides higher-resolution measurement of representational alignment than conventional methods, capturing underlying neural tuning axes and revealing DNNs' stronger alignment with ventral stream representations.

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

*Zhen Yang,Yansong Ma,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework that adaptively adjusts KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for optimal uncertainty calibration in Evidence Deep Learning, overcoming limitations of static hyperparameters in dynamic data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EDL methods use static hyperparameters for uncertainty calibration, which limits adaptability in dynamic data distributions and leads to poor calibration and generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks.

Method: MPC employs bi-level optimization: inner loop updates model parameters with dynamically configured loss function; outer loop uses policy network to optimize KL divergence coefficient and class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards balancing accuracy and uncertainty quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show MPC significantly enhances reliability and calibration of model predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

Conclusion: The learnable Dirichlet prior in MPC enables flexible adaptation to class distributions and training dynamics, providing superior uncertainty modeling compared to fixed-prior methods.

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

*Timur Mudarisov,Mikhail Burtsev,Tatiana Petrova,Radu State*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes limitations of softmax normalization in attention mechanisms, showing that increasing selected tokens reduces selective ability and gradient sensitivity issues arise at low temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental limitations of softmax-based attention mechanisms, particularly how normalization affects token selection ability and geometric separation in transformer models.

Method: Developed theoretical framework for analyzing selective ability and geometric separation, conducted experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model to validate theoretical findings on token selection patterns and gradient sensitivity.

Result: As number of selected tokens increases, model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, converging toward uniform selection. Gradient sensitivity presents challenges during training, especially at low temperature settings.

Conclusion: Softmax normalization has inherent limitations in attention mechanisms, motivating the need for more robust normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

TL;DR: BBQ is a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model that improves human evaluation of generative models by explicitly modeling rater quality and providing guaranteed convergence through EM algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard metrics fail to reflect human preferences, and human evaluations are costly and noisy due to participant variability. Existing Bradley-Terry methods either ignore rater variability or lack convergence guarantees.

Method: Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant (BBQ) that models rater quality, downweights unreliable participants, and uses Expectation-Maximization algorithm for guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence.

Result: BBQ achieves faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust, interpretable rankings compared to baseline models, even with noisy or crowdsourced raters.

Conclusion: BBQ enables more reliable and cost-effective human evaluation of generative models by addressing rater variability and providing convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Energy-Driven Steering (EDS) is a fine-tuning free framework that uses an external Energy-Based Model to dynamically steer LLM activations during inference, reducing false refusals while maintaining safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety alignment techniques make LLMs over-cautious, causing them to refuse benign prompts. The goal is to enhance safety while reducing false refusals.

Method: Train an external EBM to assign high energy to undesirable states (false refusal/jailbreak) and low energy to desirable states (helpful response/safe reject). Use energy gradients to dynamically steer LLM hidden states during inference without weight modification.

Result: Substantially lowers false refusal rates, raising compliance on ORB-H benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining baseline safety performance.

Conclusion: EDS provides an effective paradigm for building LLMs with both low false refusal rates and high safety, decoupling behavioral control from core knowledge with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

*Disharee Bhowmick,Ranjith Ramanathan,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS is an unsupervised framework that compresses time series into compact token sequences by detecting change points and summarizing segments, achieving up to 30x compression while preserving temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard time series models treat all time steps equally, leading to inefficiencies and poor robustness in long or noisy sequences. Existing approaches fail to leverage latent temporal structure like regime transitions and repeated motifs.

Method: STaTS uses BIC-based statistical divergence to detect change points across multiple resolutions, then summarizes each segment using functions like mean or generative models like GMMs. It operates as a model-agnostic preprocessor.

Result: Achieves 85-90% of full-model performance with dramatic computational cost reductions. Outperforms uniform and clustering-based compression baselines, improves robustness under noise, and preserves discriminative structure across 150+ datasets.

Conclusion: STaTS provides a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware time series modeling that can be integrated with existing encoders without retraining.

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for measuring fine-grained cross-sample memorization in federated learning, revealing that FL models memorize client data, especially intra-client data more than inter-client data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL memorization detection focuses on single samples, underestimating cross-sample risks, while centralized learning methods can't be directly applied to FL due to data access constraints.

Method: Proposed framework quantifies intra- and inter-client memorization using fine-grained cross-sample measurement across all clients, with studies on memorization patterns and influencing factors.

Result: FL models do memorize client data, with intra-client memorization being higher than inter-client memorization, influenced by decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between CL and FL memorization analysis, revealing subtle memorization patterns and key influencing factors in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

### [235] [Struc-EMB: The Potential of Structure-Aware Encoding in Language Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08774)
*Shikun Liu,Haoyu Wang,Mufei Li,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces structure-aware text embeddings that integrate structural relations (like hyperlinks/citations) directly into LLM encoding, outperforming text-only and post-hoc methods across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM text embeddings overlook rich structural information (hyperlinks, citations) that provides crucial context in real-world datasets, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Two in-process methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching, plus Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing techniques to handle noisy structural data.

Result: Structure-aware approaches consistently outperform text-only and post-hoc baselines in zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: Provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually aware embedding models.

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

### [236] [Time-Aware Feature Selection: Adaptive Temporal Masking for Stable Sparse Autoencoder Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08855)
*T. Ed Li,Junyu Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATM is a novel training method for sparse autoencoders that uses adaptive temporal masking to reduce feature absorption and improve feature stability while maintaining reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse autoencoder training methods suffer from feature absorption where features merge with each other to minimize L1 penalty, making it difficult to consistently identify and analyze model behaviors.

Method: Adaptive Temporal Masking (ATM) dynamically adjusts feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and reconstruction contributions to compute evolving importance scores, then applies probabilistic masking based on statistical thresholding.

Result: ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs while maintaining excellent reconstruction quality on the Gemma-2-2b model.

Conclusion: ATM provides a principled solution for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, establishing a foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLER (Reinforcement Learning with Ensembled Rewards) addresses system bias in RLIR by aggregating diverse models and adapting reward interpolation, achieving performance close to RLVR with stable scaling on unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLIR enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings but suffers from performance and stability issues due to system bias where models overestimate high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased reward estimation.

Method: Proposed RLER which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward interpolation and rollout selection to mitigate system bias characterized by three metrics: ρ_noise, ρ_selfbias, and ρ_symbias.

Result: RLER improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable scaling on unlabeled samples.

Conclusion: RLER effectively mitigates system bias in RLIR, making it highly applicable for stable reinforcement learning scaling in unlabeled settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

### [238] [Multimodal Prompt Optimization: Why Not Leverage Multiple Modalities for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09201)
*Yumin Choi,Dongki Kim,Jinheon Baek,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces multimodal prompt optimization, extending prompt optimization beyond text to include images, videos, and other modalities, and proposes MPO framework that jointly optimizes multimodal prompts while using Bayesian selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods are limited to text-only approaches, which restricts the full potential of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can handle images, videos, and other modalities.

Method: Proposed Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO) - a unified framework that performs joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates and uses Bayesian-based selection strategy leveraging earlier evaluations as priors.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse modalities (images, videos, molecules) show MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods.

Conclusion: Multimodal prompt optimization is a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs, and MPO effectively addresses this need.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

TL;DR: This paper compiles and analyzes diverse prompt datasets from various sources, proposes a prompt optimization method using syntactic embeddings, and improves LLM output meaningfulness by guiding prompts toward a centroid representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are emerging but lack systematic analysis. The authors aim to understand prompt construction patterns and improve prompt engineering through optimization.

Method: Compiled extensive prompt datasets from various channels, selected representative datasets for systematic analysis, and proposed a prompt optimization approach using syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures to guide LLMs to rewrite prompts toward a centroid representation.

Result: The analysis revealed commonalities and differences in prompt construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora. The proposed optimization method improved the meaningfulness of model outputs.

Conclusion: The work provides valuable insights into prompt construction patterns and demonstrates an effective optimization approach that enhances LLM performance, with datasets and code made available for further research.

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HINT is an adaptive hinting framework that improves RL training for LLMs by providing heuristic hints instead of direct answers, addressing the issue of low training affinity caused by distributional mismatch between external guidance and model policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for enhancing CoT reasoning in LLMs fail when task difficulty exceeds model capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training. Prior approaches using off-policy data often misguide policy updates due to low training affinity.

Method: Introduces Affinity metric to monitor exploration efficiency and training stability. Proposes HINT framework that provides adaptive heuristic hints to guide models toward discovering solutions autonomously, rather than giving direct answers.

Result: HINT consistently outperforms existing methods on mathematical reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results across models of various scales, with more stable learning and greater data efficiency.

Conclusion: HINT effectively addresses the low training affinity problem in RL for LLMs by using adaptive hinting that preserves autonomous reasoning capabilities while improving training efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

*Beige Jerry Jin,Leila Wehbe*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: A transformer-based encoding model that combines MEG and fMRI data from naturalistic speech experiments to estimate cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution in neuroimaging by integrating MEG (high temporal resolution) and fMRI (high spatial resolution) for single-trial naturalistic data analysis.

Method: Developed a transformer-based encoding model trained on MEG and fMRI data from multiple subjects listening to narrative stories, with a latent layer representing reconstructed cortical sources.

Result: The model predicts MEG better than single-modality encoding models, yields higher spatial/temporal fidelity than minimum-norm solutions, and generalizes well across subjects and modalities, predicting ECoG better than ECoG-trained models.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical route towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping by integrating large naturalistic experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models.

Abstract: Current non-invasive neuroimaging techniques trade off between spatial
resolution and temporal resolution. While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can
capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both
high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source
localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial
naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively
to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an
open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based
encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic
speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses
with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and
fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents
our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better
than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields
source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic
minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated
latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects
and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict
electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an
entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic
experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route
towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniWM is a unified world model that integrates visual foresight and planning for embodied navigation, improving success rates by up to 30% and enabling better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current modular architectures separate navigation planning from visual world modeling, causing state-action misalignment and limited adaptability in novel scenarios.

Method: UniWM uses a unified, memory-augmented world model with a multimodal autoregressive backbone that integrates egocentric visual foresight and planning, featuring hierarchical memory for short-term perceptual cues and long-term trajectory context.

Result: UniWM improves navigation success rates by up to 30%, reduces trajectory errors significantly, and shows impressive zero-shot generalization on the TartanDrive dataset across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniWM represents a principled step toward unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation by ensuring tight alignment between prediction and control.

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes continuous memory for GUI agents using VLM embeddings to reduce context costs while preserving visual details, with auto-scaling data collection and minimal fine-tuning achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior GUI agents compress trajectories into text tokens which increases context length and misses important visual cues like widget size and position.

Method: Uses VLM as encoder to create fixed-length continuous embeddings of GUI trajectories, plugs them into backbone input layer, and employs auto-scaling data flywheel for cost-effective memory growth with minimal parameter fine-tuning.

Result: Performance improves monotonically with memory size and retrieval depth, achieving success rates comparable to closed-source models like GPT-4o and Claude-4 on real-world GUI benchmarks.

Conclusion: Continuous memory enables GUI agents to generalize across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks more effectively than text-based approaches, with scalable performance and cost efficiency.

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

*Jingxuan Wu,Zhenglin Wan,Xingrui Yu,Yuzhe Yang,Bo An,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free method that enhances diversity in flow-based text-to-image models by adding orthogonal stochastic perturbations and feature-space objectives, maintaining image quality while improving diversity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing users to repeatedly sample for diverse outputs, which is costly and inefficient. Current methods lack diversity-awareness during inference.

Method: Uses a training-free control mechanism with feature-space objectives to encourage lateral trajectory spread and time-scheduled stochastic perturbations projected orthogonally to the generation flow. Compatible with existing flow-matching solvers without model modifications.

Result: The method monotonically increases volume surrogate while preserving marginal distribution, maintaining generation quality. Empirically improves diversity metrics (Vendi Score, Brisque) across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets while upholding image quality and alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed inference-time control mechanism provides a principled way to enhance diversity in flow-based text-to-image generation without compromising quality, offering an efficient alternative to repeated sampling.

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

TL;DR: LLM-based framework critiques VRP-generated delivery routes using policy criteria, achieving 79-86% accuracy in identifying routing issues, offering scalable evaluation beyond conventional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: India's e-commerce growth faces high last-mile delivery costs (50% of operations), with VRP solvers limited by unstructured addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposed framework uses LLMs to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, generating and evaluating 400 cases with both open-source and proprietary reasoning models.

Result: Open-source LLMs achieved 79% accuracy in identifying routing issues, while proprietary reasoning models reached up to 86% accuracy in route evaluation.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation provides effective and scalable assessment of VRP routes beyond conventional distance/time metrics, with potential to improve cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and sustainability in developing countries.

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

Motivation: To generate more robust and performant heuristics by enhancing LLM-based approaches with explanations for underperformance and improvement suggestions.

Method: Expose LLM to underperforming instances, explain why failures occur, and specialize heuristic design to specific regions of the input space.

Result: Produced heuristics with ~28x better worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improved average performance, while maintaining runtime efficiency.

Conclusion: Simple augmentation techniques that provide failure explanations and targeted design can significantly enhance the robustness of LLM-generated heuristics.

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study shows both humans and AI exhibit pro-human attribution bias when evaluating literary style, with AI showing 2.5x stronger bias than humans. AI systems systematically devalue content labeled as AI-generated regardless of actual authorship.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans and machines evaluate literary style given the widespread use of AI writing tools, and to measure attribution bias in aesthetic judgments where objective standards are elusive.

Method: Two controlled experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556) and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages under blind, accurately labeled, and counterfactually labeled conditions. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a 14×14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators.

Result: Both humans and AI showed systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans had +13.7 percentage point bias (Cohen's h=0.28), while AI showed +34.3 percentage point bias (h=0.70), 2.5x stronger effect. Study 2 confirmed bias operates across AI architectures (+25.8pp). Attribution labels caused evaluators to invert assessment criteria.

Conclusion: AI models have absorbed human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training, not only replicating but amplifying human tendency for attribution bias in aesthetic judgment.

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

TL;DR: ReviewerToo is an AI-assisted peer review framework that achieves 81.8% accuracy in accept/reject decisions on ICLR 2025 papers, close to human reviewers (83.9%), with AI reviews rated higher quality than average human reviews but still below expert levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Peer review suffers from inconsistencies, subjectivity, and scalability challenges, creating a need for AI assistance to complement human judgment with systematic assessments.

Method: Developed ReviewerToo, a modular framework for AI-assisted peer review, tested on 1,963 ICLR 2025 papers using gpt-oss-120b model with specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria.

Result: AI achieved 81.8% accuracy in accept/reject decisions vs 83.9% for humans; AI reviews rated higher quality than average human reviews but below expert levels; AI excels at fact-checking and literature coverage but struggles with assessing novelty and theoretical contributions.

Conclusion: AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness in peer review while leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts, providing a foundation for hybrid peer-review systems that scale with scientific publishing growth.

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

TL;DR: SCT is a new knowledge injection paradigm that fuses knowledge graphs with LLMs through semantic graph conditions and adaptive fusion, outperforming prefix-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prefix-tuning methods simply concatenate knowledge embeddings with text inputs, overlooking relational semantics in KGs and imposing heavy reasoning burden on LLMs.

Method: SCT uses a Semantic Graph Module with GNN to extract context-aware semantic conditions from local graph neighborhoods, then a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module adaptively modulates textual embeddings via parameterized projectors.

Result: Extensive experiments show SCT significantly outperforms prefix-tuning and other baselines on knowledge graph benchmarks.

Conclusion: By modulating input representation with semantic graph context before LLM inference, SCT provides more direct and potent signals for accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

### [250] [LiveOIBench: Can Large Language Models Outperform Human Contestants in Informatics Olympiads?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09595)
*Kaijian Zou,Aaron Xiong,Yunxiang Zhang,Frederick Zhang,Yueqi Ren,Jirong Yang,Ayoung Lee,Shitanshu Bhushan,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveOIBench is a comprehensive benchmark with 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems featuring extensive test cases, designed to evaluate LLMs' coding capabilities against top human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coding benchmarks lack exceptionally challenging problems, have insufficient test case coverage, and rely on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.

Method: Created a benchmark with 403 problems from 72 official Informatics Olympiads (2023-2025), each with ~60 expert-designed test cases, featuring detailed subtask rubrics, elite contestant performance data, and a self-contained evaluation system.

Result: GPT-5 achieved 81.76th percentile (strong but below top humans at >90th), while open-weight models like GPT-OSS-120B only reached 60th percentile, showing significant capability gaps between frontier closed models and open alternatives.

Conclusion: Robust reasoning models should prioritize precise problem analysis over excessive exploration; the benchmark will be publicly available to facilitate reproducible assessments and future model development.

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.
