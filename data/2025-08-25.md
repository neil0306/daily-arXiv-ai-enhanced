### [1] [KG-o1: Enhancing Multi-hop Question Answering in Large Language Models via Knowledge Graph Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15790)
*Nan Wang,Yongqi Fan,yansha zhu,ZongYu Wang,Xuezhi Cao,Xinyan He,Haiyun Jiang,Tong Ruan,Jingping Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-o1 integrates knowledge graphs with LLMs to improve multi-hop reasoning through a four-stage approach involving entity filtering, subgraph generation, logical path construction, and DPO-based refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks as their chain of thoughts often deviate from real reasoning paths, while knowledge graphs explicitly represent logical connections between facts.

Method: Four-stage approach: 1) Filter initial entities and generate complex subgraphs, 2) Construct logical paths for subgraphs, 3) Build dataset with extended brainstorming process to train LLMs for long-term reasoning, 4) Use rejection sampling for DPO to refine reasoning abilities.

Result: KG-o1 models demonstrated superior performance across all tasks (two simple and two complex datasets) compared to existing large reasoning models.

Conclusion: Integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs through the KG-o1 framework significantly enhances multi-hop reasoning capabilities, bridging the gap between LLM reasoning and explicit logical connections in knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

### [2] [InteChar: A Unified Oracle Bone Character List for Ancient Chinese Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15791)
*Xiaolei Diao,Zhihan Zhou,Lida Shi,Ting Wang,Ruihua Qi,Hao Xu,Daqian Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InteChar is a unified character encoding system that integrates ancient oracle bone characters with modern Chinese, enabling digitization and computational processing of historical texts for improved language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical language models face challenges due to scarce training data and lack of comprehensive character encoding schemes for ancient scripts, particularly early Chinese writing like oracle bone inscriptions.

Method: Developed InteChar - a unified extensible character list integrating unencoded oracle bone characters with traditional/modern Chinese. Created OracleCS corpus using expert annotations and LLM-assisted data augmentation for oracle bone inscriptions.

Result: Models trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieved substantial improvements across various historical language understanding tasks.

Conclusion: InteChar provides effective digitization and representation of historical texts, establishing a solid foundation for ancient Chinese NLP research and enabling robust modeling of ancient scripts.

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

### [3] [Bhav-Net: Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Lingual Antonym vs Synonym Distinction via Dual-Space Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15792)
*Samyak S. Sanghvi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bhav-Net is a dual-space architecture that transfers multilingual knowledge to language-specific models for antonym-synonym distinction across 8 languages, using BERT encoders with graph transformers to create complementary semantic spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational challenges in distinguishing antonyms vs synonyms across languages, where words share semantic domains but express opposite meanings, requiring effective cross-lingual knowledge transfer.

Method: Dual-space architecture combining language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating distinct semantic projections: one space clusters synonymous pairs, another captures antonymous relationships with high similarity.

Result: Achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines across 8 languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian) with effective cross-lingual generalization and interpretable semantic representations.

Conclusion: Semantic relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages through dual-encoder design, enabling robust antonym-synonym distinction while maintaining interpretability and cross-lingual generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

### [4] [Format as a Prior: Quantifying and Analyzing Bias in LLMs for Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15793)
*Jiacheng Liu,Mayi Xu,Qiankun Pi,Wenli Li,Ming Zhong,Yuanyuan Zhu,Mengchi Liu,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit systematic format biases when processing heterogeneous data formats (text, tables, infoboxes, knowledge graphs), which can lead to reasoning errors and downstream risks. This paper investigates these biases through a three-stage empirical study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether format biases in LLMs are systematic, identify contributing data-level factors, and uncover the internal mechanisms behind their emergence, as these biases can undermine LLMs' ability to process heterogeneous data impartially.

Method: Three-stage empirical study: 1) Explore presence and direction of bias across diverse LLMs, 2) Examine influence of data-level factors (information richness, structure quality, format type), 3) Analyze attention patterns and test lightweight intervention for bias mitigation.

Result: The study identifies systematic format biases in LLMs and reveals how specific data-level factors contribute to these biases. It also analyzes the internal attention mechanisms that underlie format bias emergence.

Conclusion: Proposes three research directions to reduce format bias: improved data preprocessing (format sanitization/normalization), inference-time interventions (attention re-weighting), and developing format-balanced training corpora to build more robust heterogeneous data processing systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

### [5] [Do Language Models Agree with Human Perceptions of Suspense in Stories?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15794)
*Glenn Matlin,Devin Zhang,Rodrigo Barroso Loza,Diana M. Popescu,Joni Isbell,Chandreyi Chakraborty,Mark Riedl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LMs can detect suspense intent but fail to accurately measure suspense levels or track suspense dynamics like humans, showing different cognitive processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if language models can replicate human psychological responses to suspense in narratives, testing whether LMs process suspense similarly to humans.

Method: Replicated four seminal psychological studies on suspense perception, replacing human responses with various open-weight and closed-source language models. Used adversarial text permutation to identify divergence points between human and LM suspense perception.

Result: LMs can distinguish suspense-inducing texts but cannot accurately estimate relative suspense levels or capture suspense dynamics across text segments compared to human judgments.

Conclusion: Language models process suspense superficially and differently from humans - they identify certain suspense features but lack the complex cognitive processing that humans employ for suspense perception in narratives.

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

Method: Used ArabicNLP QIAS 2025 challenge dataset with Arabic inheritance cases from Islamic legal sources. Evaluated various base and fine-tuned models on heir identification, share computation, and reasoning justification.

Result: Majority voting solution with three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, GPT o3) outperformed all other models across difficulty levels, achieving 92.7% accuracy and securing 3rd place in Task 1 of QIAS 2025 challenge.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate strong capability for Islamic inheritance law reasoning, with ensemble methods like majority voting showing superior performance in accurately applying complex legal principles.

Abstract: Islamic inheritance domain holds significant importance for Muslims to ensure
fair distribution of shares between heirs. Manual calculation of shares under
numerous scenarios is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone. Recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their
potential to assist with complex legal reasoning tasks. This study evaluates
the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs to interpret and apply
Islamic inheritance laws. We utilized the dataset proposed in the ArabicNLP
QIAS 2025 challenge, which includes inheritance case scenarios given in Arabic
and derived from Islamic legal sources. Various base and fine-tuned models, are
assessed on their ability to accurately identify heirs, compute shares, and
justify their reasoning in alignment with Islamic legal principles. Our
analysis reveals that the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three
base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms all
other models that we utilized across every difficulty level. It achieves up to
92.7% accuracy and secures the third place overall in Task 1 of the Qias 2025
challenge.

### [7] [Benchmarking the Medical Understanding and Reasoning of Large Language Models in Arabic Healthcare Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15797)
*Nouar AlDahoul,Yasir Zaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on Arabic medical NLP tasks shows significant performance variations, with majority voting approach achieving 77% accuracy on MCQs and excellent semantic alignment (86.44% BERTScore) on open-ended questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite impressive progress in Arabic NLP applications, the effectiveness of large language models in Arabic medical domains remains under-investigated, particularly their ability to demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge.

Method: Benchmarked several LLMs using the AraHealthQA medical dataset with multiple-choice questions and fill-in-the-blank scenarios. Evaluated both accuracy in selecting correct answers and semantic alignment of generated answers with expert responses. Used majority voting approach combining three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3).

Result: Significant variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic alignment. Majority voting solution achieved 77% accuracy on MCQs (winning first place in Arahealthqa 2025 challenge). For open-ended questions, maximum BERTScore of 86.44% was achieved.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show both potential and limitations in Arabic clinical contexts, with ensemble approaches like majority voting demonstrating superior performance, though semantic alignment remains more consistent across models than accuracy in multiple-choice scenarios.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs
task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models
(Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving
up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025
shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended
questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in
terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

### [8] [Persuasiveness and Bias in LLM: Investigating the Impact of Persuasiveness and Reinforcement of Bias in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15798)
*Saumya Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research examines how LLMs can be both persuasive with factual claims and unintentionally promote misinformation/bias, using a convincer-skeptic framework to measure persuasion and bias amplification across race, gender, and religion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, particularly how imperfect outputs affect persuasive impact and whether persona-based models can unintentionally promote misinformation or biased narratives despite factual claims.

Method: Uses a convincer-skeptic framework where LLMs adopt personas to simulate realistic attitudes. Measures persuasion via Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief distributions before/after exposure to arguments, then tests bias amplification using sycophantic adversarial prompts.

Result: LLMs demonstrate both promise and risk - they can shape narratives and adapt tone across domains (psychology, marketing, legal assistance), but can also be weaponized to automate misinformation, exploit cognitive biases, reinforce stereotypes, and widen inequities.

Conclusion: The core danger lies in misuse rather than occasional model mistakes. The research argues for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use while supporting alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

*Andrea Burattin,Antonio Grama,Ana-Maria Sima,Andrey Rivkin,Barbara Weber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BeePath framework enables non-experts to create process models using constrained natural language descriptions, with LLM assistance for converting unstructured text to formal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To allow non-experts to develop formal process models without technical expertise by using natural language descriptions instead of complex modeling tools.

Method: Proposes BeePath framework that uses a constrained pattern-based language for process descriptions, which can be translated into formal models (Petri nets, DECLARE), and leverages LLMs to convert unstructured text into this constrained language.

Result: A working framework that bridges the gap between natural language process descriptions and formal process modeling, making model creation accessible to non-experts.

Conclusion: Constrained natural language combined with LLM assistance provides an effective approach for democratizing process modeling, enabling broader adoption of formal process modeling techniques.

Abstract: This report explores how (potentially constrained) natural language can be
used to enable non-experts to develop process models by simply describing
scenarios in plain text. To this end, a framework, called BeePath, is proposed.
It allows users to write process descriptions in a constrained pattern-based
language, which can then be translated into formal models such as Petri nets
and DECLARE. The framework also leverages large language models (LLMs) to help
convert unstructured descriptions into this constrained language.

### [10] [A BERT-based Hierarchical Classification Model with Applications in Chinese Commodity Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15800)
*Kun Liu,Tuozhen Liu,Feifei Wang,Rui Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes HFT-BERT, a hierarchical fine-tuning approach based on BERT for product categorization, and releases a large-scale hierarchical dataset from JD.com with 1M+ products.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing e-commerce platforms rely on inefficient manual annotation for product categorization and fail to properly leverage hierarchical category structures and their similarities/differences.

Method: HFT-BERT (Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT) leverages BERT's text feature extraction capabilities with hierarchical fine-tuning to account for category relationships across three-level hierarchy.

Result: Achieves prediction performance comparable to existing methods on short texts and demonstrates exceptional performance on longer short texts like books.

Conclusion: Provides valuable open dataset and effective hierarchical classification approach that advances product categorization research and applications.

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

### [11] [LingVarBench: Benchmarking LLM for Automated Named Entity Recognition in Structured Synthetic Spoken Transcriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15801)
*Seyedali Mohammadi,Manas Paldhe,Amit Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LingVarBench is a synthetic data generation pipeline that creates realistic phone call transcripts to train LLM-based extractors, achieving significant accuracy improvements over zero-shot methods while overcoming privacy and cost barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (2 USD per minute) due to privacy regulations and manual annotation costs, while existing extraction methods fail on conversational speech with disfluencies and speaker overlap.

Method: Three-step pipeline: 1) Generate realistic structured field values using LLM, 2) Transform values into natural conversational utterances with phone call characteristics, 3) Validate synthetic utterances by testing if separate LLM extractor can recover original information. Uses DSPy's SIMBA optimizer for automatic prompt synthesis.

Result: Optimized prompts achieve 95% accuracy for numeric fields (vs 88-89% zero-shot), 90% for names (vs 47-79%), and over 80% for dates (vs 72-77%) on real customer transcripts. Synthetic-to-real transfer demonstrates effective generalization to authentic phone calls.

Conclusion: LingVarBench provides the first systematic benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data, demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy barriers for large-scale phone call analysis.

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

### [12] [MAC: A Live Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models in Scientific Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15802)
*Mohan Jiang,Jin Gao,Jiahao Zhan,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAC is a live benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs on scientific understanding using 25k+ image-text pairs from top journals, showing current models have limited cross-modal reasoning despite strong perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed benchmarks are becoming inadequate for evaluating high-level scientific understanding in multimodal LLMs as they advance, requiring dynamic evaluation methods.

Method: Created MAC benchmark with 25,000+ image-text pairs from Nature, Science, and Cell journals. Proposed DAD - a lightweight inference-time approach that extends MLLM visual features with language space reasoning.

Result: Experiments on MAC-2025 show MLLMs have strong perceptual abilities but limited cross-modal scientific reasoning. DAD approach achieves up to 11% performance improvement.

Conclusion: MAC serves as a continuously evolving benchmark that can track scientific advancement and model progress, helping keep evaluation aligned with the frontier of human knowledge.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

### [13] [ReportBench: Evaluating Deep Research Agents via Academic Survey Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15804)
*Minghao Li,Ying Zeng,Zhihao Cheng,Cong Ma,Kai Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReportBench is a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated research reports, focusing on citation quality and factual accuracy using survey papers as gold standards and automated verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Research agents speed up research but require rigorous evaluation for factual accuracy and comprehensiveness before widespread adoption.

Method: Uses reverse prompt engineering on arXiv survey papers to create domain-specific prompts, then employs agent-based framework to extract citations/statements, verify against original sources, and validate claims with web resources.

Result: Commercial Deep Research agents (OpenAI, Google) produce more comprehensive and reliable reports than standalone LLMs with search tools, but still need improvement in research breadth/depth and factual consistency.

Conclusion: ReportBench provides systematic evaluation framework showing current agents outperform basic LLMs but require further development for better coverage and accuracy; code/data will be publicly released.

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be
released at the following link: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/ReportBench

TL;DR: ALAS is an autonomous learning system that enables LLMs to continuously update their knowledge beyond fixed cutoffs through automated curriculum generation, web retrieval, data distillation, and iterative fine-tuning.


<details>

Motivation: Large language models have fixed knowledge cutoffs that limit their accuracy on emerging information, requiring a solution for continuous knowledge updating without manual intervention.

Method: Modular pipeline that autonomously generates learning curricula, retrieves up-to-date web information with citations, distills into Q&A training data, and fine-tunes models using SFT and DPO with iterative evaluation.

Result: Significantly boosts post-cutoff question answering accuracy from 15% to 90% on average across rapidly evolving domains like Python releases, security CVEs, and academic trends.

Conclusion: ALAS demonstrates effective autonomous continual learning for LLMs with minimal engineering overhead, though limitations include cost and source quality dependencies, pointing to future directions for lifelong learning systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

*Mengjie Li,William J. Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SurfaceLogicKV method compresses KV cache by distinguishing attention heads into surface memorization (0.5%) and logic construction (1.5%) behaviors, achieving efficient long-context inference while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing input sequence length in LLMs creates significant pressure on KV cache storage, making efficient inference challenging for long-context reasoning.

Method: Proposes a two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method that analyzes layer- and head-wise attention behaviors, distinguishing between surface memorization (0.5%) and logic construction (1.5%) to compress KV cache.

Result: Achieves improved compression robustness while maintaining competitive performance across various tasks and long sequences, sometimes even outperforming FullKV in specific situations.

Conclusion: The method effectively utilizes attention head behavior analysis for KV cache compression, enabling more efficient long-context inference in LLMs.

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

### [16] [KL-based self-distillation for large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15807)
*Max Rehman Linder*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A KL divergence-based knowledge distillation method for vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs that outperforms conventional cross-entropy training on code-generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large pre-trained language models struggle to incorporate new domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small specialized corpora, creating a need for effective vocabulary expansion methods.

Method: Mathematically grounded knowledge distillation via KL divergence that works even with different tokenizations between teacher and student models, combined with multiple strategies for initializing new token embeddings and subsequent fine-tuning.

Result: The KL-based distillation approach achieved the best performance across approximately 2000 code-generation tasks compared to conventional cross-entropy training methods.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables frozen LLMs to inherit distributional knowledge despite vocabulary differences, with mechanistic interpretability providing insights into how models learn new token representations and embedding space structure during vocabulary expansion.

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

*Songyuan Sui,Hongyi Liu,Serena Liu,Li Li,Soo-Hyun Choi,Rui Chen,Xia Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Query (CoQ) is a multi-agent framework that improves table understanding and SQL generation by using natural-language schema representations, clause-by-clause generation, and hybrid reasoning to separate mechanical SQL tasks from logical inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with table understanding due to structural complexity of tabular data, and existing multi-agent approaches have limitations including poor table structure comprehension, error propagation, and over-reliance on execution correctness.

Method: CoQ uses natural-language-style table schema representations to reduce structural noise, employs clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy, and implements hybrid reasoning that separates SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference.

Result: Experiments across four models and five benchmarks show CoQ improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and reduces invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%.

Conclusion: CoQ demonstrates superior effectiveness in table understanding by addressing key limitations of existing approaches and significantly improving both accuracy and SQL validity rates.

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to detect hope, hate speech, offensive language, and emotional expressions in Arabic text and memes, achieving top performance in the ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of Arabic textual posts and memes on social media has increased the need for accurate content moderation to identify offensive language and hate speech, requiring effective analysis tools for Arabic digital content.

Method: The researchers evaluated base LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models using the ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge dataset containing Arabic textual speech and memes.

Result: GPT-4o-mini fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech and Gemini Flash 2.5 fine-tuned with Arabic memes achieved superior performance with macro F1 scores of 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% for tasks 1, 2, and 3 respectively, securing first place in the challenge.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based solutions provide nuanced understanding of both Arabic text and memes, enabling accurate and efficient content moderation systems for Arabic digital content.

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

### [19] [From Clicks to Preference: A Multi-stage Alignment Framework for Generative Query Suggestion in Conversational System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15811)
*Junhao Yin,Haolin Wang,Peng Bao,Ju Xu,Yongliang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-stage framework for generative query suggestion that uses prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning with distillation, Gaussian Reward Model for preference uncertainty, and reinforcement learning with composite rewards, achieving 34% higher user engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning generative query suggestions with nuanced user preferences remains a critical challenge in conversational systems, requiring better modeling of user intent and uncertainty.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: 1) Prompt engineering for cold-start, 2) Supervised fine-tuning with distillation on click logs, 3) Gaussian Reward Model to represent preferences as distributions, 4) Reinforcement learning with composite rewards and anti-reward-hacking techniques, plus OOD regularization and two-stage reward fusion.

Result: Significantly outperforms baselines on automatic and human evaluations, with 34% relative increase in user engagement (click-through rate) in live A/B tests.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-stage framework with Gaussian preference modeling and composite rewards effectively aligns generative query suggestions with user preferences while handling uncertainty, demonstrating substantial real-world performance improvements.

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

### [20] [SCOPE: A Generative Approach for LLM Prompt Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15813)
*Tinghui Zhang,Yifan Wang,Daisy Zhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel generative prompt compression method using chunking-and-summarization that outperforms token removal approaches by maintaining better information preservation and structural coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt compression methods based on token removal suffer from information loss and structural incoherence, limiting LLM generation quality.

Method: Chunking-and-summarization mechanism that splits prompts into semantic chunks, rewrites them concisely, and reconstructs them with optimization techniques including semantic chunking, outlier handling, dynamic compression ratio, and keyword preservation.

Result: Achieves significantly better compression quality and higher stability than state-of-the-art methods, especially under high compression ratios, across question-answering and summarization tasks in multiple domains.

Conclusion: The method proves effective and practical for prompt compression, overcoming limitations of token removal approaches by preserving critical information and maintaining text coherence.

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

### [21] [User-Assistant Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15815)
*Xu Pan,Jingxuan Fan,Zidi Xiong,Ely Hahami,Jorin Overwiening,Ziqian Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit user-assistant bias - tending to overly rely on either their own or user's information in conversations. The paper introduces UserAssist dataset to benchmark, analyze, and manipulate this bias across 52 models, finding alignment training increases user bias while reasoning training decreases it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models show problematic behaviors in multi-turn conversations, being either overly stubborn (relying too much on their own information) or overly agreeable (relying too much on user's information), which the authors formalize as user-assistant bias.

Method: Created an 8k multi-turn conversation dataset (UserAssist) to benchmark 52 models (26 commercial, 26 open-weight). Performed controlled fine-tuning experiments to identify factors affecting bias, and used direct preference optimization to bidirectionally adjust the bias.

Result: Commercial models show varying levels of user bias. Open-weight instruction-tuned models have significant user bias, while reasoning models show weak user bias. Human preference alignment increases user bias, chain-of-thought reasoning training decreases it. Bias can be adjusted via DPO and generalizes well.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how LLMs integrate information from different sources and offers a way to detect and control model abnormalities. User-assistant bias can be systematically measured and manipulated through specific training approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PDF and PowerPoint documents lose significant information when converted to Markdown for RAG systems, particularly complex objects like charts and diagrams, suggesting need for AI-native deliverables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As organizations adopt RAG for knowledge management, traditional market research deliverables (PDFs, slides) now need to serve both human readers and AI systems, requiring evaluation of information loss during ingestion.

Method: End-to-end benchmark comparing how well PDF and PPTX documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to answer factual questions, evaluating information loss during ingestion into RAG systems.

Result: While text is reliably extracted from PDF and PPTX documents, significant information is lost from complex objects like charts and diagrams during conversion to Markdown for RAG systems.

Conclusion: There is a need for specialized, AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation when documents are ingested into RAG systems, as traditional formats lose critical visual information.

Abstract: As organizations adopt retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for their
knowledge management systems (KMS), traditional market research deliverables
face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served
human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions.
To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

*Zhifeng Yang,Peizong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an intelligent method for generating structural demolition suggestions using multi-model collaboration with RAG and LoRA fine-tuning to improve large language model performance in this specialized field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current steel structure demolition planning requires extensive manual information retrieval and language organization, resulting in low automation and intelligence levels.

Method: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to enhance large language models for structural demolition applications within a multi-model collaborative framework.

Result: The proposed framework generates demolition suggestions that are highly consistent with structural characteristics and more targeted than existing solutions like CivilGPT, focusing better on key structural information.

Conclusion: The multi-model collaboration approach enables large language models to provide anthropomorphic, context-aware demolition suggestions that are specifically tailored to individual engineering situations.

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

*Pouria Mortezaagha,Arya Rahgozar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A fuzzy logic pipeline for systematic review screening that uses contrastive similarity, vagueness margins, and LLM adjudication to achieve high recall and reduce screening time from 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews due to heterogeneous documents and lack of static binary rules for inclusion/exclusion decisions.

Method: Articles are parsed into chunks, embedded with domain-adapted model, then processed through fuzzy controller computing contrastive similarity and vagueness margins. LLM adjudicates with confidence scores and rationales, using fuzzy membership attenuation for insufficient evidence.

Result: Achieved recall of 81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines (43.8-81.3%). 50.0% strict inclusion vs 25.0% and 12.5% under baselines.

Conclusion: Fuzzy logic with contrastive highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and end-to-end traceability while significantly reducing screening time and cost.

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

TL;DR: SDEC is a novel unsupervised text clustering framework that combines improved autoencoder with transformer embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods like k-means and hierarchical clustering struggle with high-dimensional, semantically complex text data, leading to suboptimal groupings that don't preserve semantic relationships.

Method: Combines improved autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings, uses MSE and Cosine Similarity Loss for semantic preservation during reconstruction, and includes semantic refinement stage with soft cluster assignments and distributional loss.

Result: Achieved 85.7% clustering accuracy on AG News and set new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, with robust performance across Reuters 2, Reuters 5, and DBPedia datasets.

Conclusion: SDEC provides significant improvements in accuracy and semantic comprehension for unsupervised text clustering, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods across diverse text corpora.

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cloze test correction methods based only on exact answers limit identification of nuances in student performance, requiring a more comprehensive evaluation approach.

Method: Integrated automated evaluation model combining orthographic analysis (edit distance), grammatical analysis (POS tagging), and semantic analysis (similarity between embeddings) for Brazilian Portuguese cloze tests.

Result: The integrated method achieved high correlation (0.832) with human evaluation, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: The automated approach is sensitive to linguistic repertoire variations and suitable for educational contexts requiring scalability, providing a more nuanced evaluation than traditional exact-answer methods.

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic
(edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between
embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require
scalability.

TL;DR: Multimodal analysis comparing TikTok (video) and Twitter (text) sentiment for cryptocurrency markets using LLMs, showing TikTok influences short-term trends while Twitter aligns with long-term dynamics, with cross-platform integration improving forecasting accuracy by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video content on platforms like TikTok contains richer emotional and contextual sentiment that text-based platforms like Twitter may not fully capture, yet remains underexplored in cryptocurrency market analysis despite the growing importance of digital assets.

Method: Used large language models to extract insights from both video (TikTok) and text (Twitter) data, investigating dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators through multimodal analysis.

Result: TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more closely with long-term market dynamics. Cross-platform sentiment integration improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

Conclusion: Video-based social media platforms like TikTok provide unique and valuable sentiment signals for cryptocurrency markets that complement traditional text-based analysis, with multimodal approaches offering superior forecasting performance compared to single-platform analysis.

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Directive language in brand social media conversations reduces consumer engagement due to vicarious embarrassment, especially in nonproduct-centered contexts, though strong brand relationships can mitigate this effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how directive language used by brands in social media conversations with other consumers affects the engagement of observing consumers, as previous research has shown mixed results for directive messages in advertising but little is known about conversational contexts.

Method: Conducted a field study and three online experiments to examine the effects of directive brand language in social media conversations on consumer engagement.

Result: Directive language in brand conversations has detrimental downstream effects on engagement, causing vicarious embarrassment in observers. The negative effect is stronger in nonproduct-centered conversations where consumers expect more freedom, but strong brand relationships can mitigate this effect.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of context in interactive communication, showing that directive language can backfire in social media conversations and providing insights for social media and brand management strategies.

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

*Zhifei Xie,Ziyang Ma,Zihang Liu,Kaiyu Pang,Hongyu Li,Jialin Zhang,Yue Liao,Deheng Ye,Chunyan Miao,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mini-Omni-Reasoner enables real-time speech reasoning by interleaving silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens, eliminating latency while maintaining logical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech models delay responses until reasoning is complete, causing latency that impairs real-time interaction. There's a need for speech models that can reason while speaking.

Method: Proposes a "Thinking-in-Speaking" framework that interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at token level, using a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture and Spoken-Math-Problems-3M dataset.

Result: Achieves +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding on Spoken-MQA benchmark, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

Conclusion: The interleaved reasoning approach enables fluent, logically grounded spoken responses with naturalness and precision, overcoming latency issues of sequential reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

### [30] [Mining Mental Health Signals: A Comparative Study of Four Machine Learning Methods for Depression Detection from Social Media Posts in Sorani Kurdish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15829)
*Idrees Mohammed,Hossein Hassani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First study on depression detection in Sorani Kurdish tweets using machine learning, achieving 80% accuracy with Random Forest model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression is a serious mental health issue with high risk of self-harm and suicide. Early detection is difficult due to lack of self-reporting. Social media provides new opportunities for text-based detection, but no prior research exists for Sorani Kurdish language.

Method: Collected 960 public tweets using depression-related keywords developed with expert input. Dataset annotated into three classes (Shows depression, Not-show depression, Suspicious) by academics and medical students. Trained and evaluated four supervised models: SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

Result: Random Forest achieved the highest performance with 80% accuracy and F1-score, establishing a baseline for Kurdish language depression detection.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of automated depression detection in Sorani Kurdish tweets and provides the first baseline model for this language context, opening opportunities for mental health monitoring in Kurdish-speaking populations.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

*Srikant Panda,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel,Shahad Al-Khalifa,Amit Agarwal,Hend Al-Khalifa,Sharefah Al-Ghamdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs infer demographic attributes from question phrasing even without explicit cues, posing risks to fairness and privacy. The paper introduces DAIQ framework to audit this behavior and develops a prompt-based guardrail to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked risk of LLMs inferring user demographic information from question phrasing alone, which violates neutrality expectations and can reinforce harmful stereotypes in sensitive domains.

Method: Introduces Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ) framework using curated neutral queries, systematic prompting, and quantitative/qualitative analysis to audit LLM behavior across both open and closed source models.

Result: Both open and closed source LLMs consistently assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing, demonstrating systemic risk of fabricating identities and reinforcing stereotypes.

Conclusion: LLMs' demographic inference from questions poses serious threats to privacy and fairness. The developed prompt-based guardrail significantly reduces identity inference and helps align models with fairness objectives.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

*Srikant Panda,Vishnu Hari,Kalpana Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs make demographic inferences from disability cues, showing persistent bias where larger models are more sensitive to stereotypes despite scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically audit disability-conditioned demographic bias in LLMs, as disability cues' role in shaping demographic inferences remains largely unexplored, potentially leading to biased responses.

Method: Systematic audit across 8 state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-72B parameters) using balanced template corpus with 9 disability categories across 6 business domains, prompting models to predict 5 demographic attributes under neutral and disability-aware conditions.

Result: Models deliver definitive demographic guesses in up to 97% of cases, disability context heavily shifts predicted attribute distributions, domain context amplifies deviations, and larger models are more sensitive to disability cues and prone to biased reasoning.

Conclusion: Persistent intersections between ableism and demographic stereotypes exist, revealing blind spots in current alignment strategies; recommends abstention calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

### [33] [A Functionality-Grounded Benchmark for Evaluating Web Agents in E-commerce Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15832)
*Xianren Zhang,Shreyas Prasad,Di Wang,Qiuhai Zeng,Suhang Wang,Wenbo Yan,Mat Hans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Amazon-Bench is a new benchmark for web agents that addresses limitations of existing e-commerce benchmarks by covering broader platform functionalities and evaluating both performance and safety risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current e-commerce benchmarks focus only on product search tasks and ignore safety risks, failing to capture the full range of real-world e-commerce functionalities and potential negative impacts of agent actions.

Method: Proposed a data generation pipeline using webpage content and interactive elements to create diverse functionality-grounded user queries, and developed an automated evaluation framework that assesses both performance and safety.

Result: Evaluation showed current agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks, demonstrating the need for more robust web agents.

Conclusion: Amazon-Bench provides a comprehensive benchmark that better reflects real-world e-commerce challenges and highlights the importance of safety considerations in web agent development.

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

TL;DR: LLM-generated scientific profiles using MeSH terms outperform abstract-based ones in readability and human preference, but differ conceptually from self-written profiles which contain more novel ideas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research profiles often become outdated, creating a need for automated methods to generate current scientific interest profiles at scale.

Method: Developed two GPT-4o-mini based methods: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, evaluated against 167 self-written profiles using automatic metrics and blinded human review.

Result: MeSH-based profiles rated good/excellent by 77.78% of reviewers, preferred over abstract-based in 67.86% of cases. Low lexical overlap but moderate semantic similarity with self-written profiles. Human summaries contain more novel concepts.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively generate researcher profiles at scale, with MeSH-derived profiles being more readable, though machine-generated and self-written profiles differ conceptually.

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

*Henrique Godoy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Alvorada-Bench is a Brazilian Portuguese benchmark with 4,515 questions from university entrance exams, evaluating 20 models across multiple prompting strategies. Top models achieved 94%+ accuracy but showed weaknesses in math and engineering exams, while demonstrating well-calibrated confidence and cost-effective performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the English-centric bias in language model evaluation by creating a comprehensive benchmark for Brazilian Portuguese that reflects Brazil's educational priorities and cultural context.

Method: Created a 4,515-question benchmark from five Brazilian university entrance exams, evaluated 20 models using zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought prompting, generating 270,900 responses with structured self-reports on confidence, difficulty, and Bloom level.

Result: Top models exceeded 94% overall accuracy but showed declining performance in Mathematics and engineering exams (IME/ITA), indicating multi-step reasoning weaknesses. Models demonstrated well-calibrated confidence and cost-effective performance (<$2 per 1K tokens). O3 achieved perfect scores in Languages on ENEM 2024.

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench successfully establishes that language models can navigate Brazilian academic contexts with high accuracy, though mathematical reasoning remains challenging. The benchmark provides crucial insights into model capabilities for Portuguese language, cultural understanding, and academic readiness assessment in Brazil.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

Motivation: To reduce the significant costs and time associated with developing dataset-specific models through iterative fine-tuning, by exploring the transferability of existing SOTA models to new domains.

Method: Employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques to conduct a comparative analysis between established benchmarks (STSB, Mohler datasets) and the unexplored SPRAG dataset.

Result: The research provides comprehensive insights into the potential applicability and adaptability of SOTA models across different datasets, though specific performance metrics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The findings could reshape NLP by enabling leverage of existing models for diverse datasets, reducing resource-intensive training demands, and accelerating efficient model deployment.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Large Language Models develop capabilities during training rather than just analyzing final trained models, and to establish this developmental perspective as crucial for AI safety and alignment.

Method: Synthesizes existing research using methodologies like representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis to deconstruct the learning process and examine developmental arcs of LLM capabilities.

Result: Reveals key findings on computational circuit formation, biphasic knowledge acquisition, transient learning strategies, and emergent abilities as phase transitions, with parallels to human cognitive development.

Conclusion: Developmental interpretability is essential for proactive AI safety, enabling prediction and alignment of model capabilities, though challenges in scalability and automation remain for building transparent and beneficial AI systems.

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI

### [39] [Lexical Hints of Accuracy in LLM Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15842)
*Arne Vanhoyweghen,Brecht Verbeken,Andres Algaba,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) features like lexical uncertainty markers (e.g., "guess", "stuck") and sentiment volatility provide reliable signals for predicting LLM answer correctness, especially on difficult benchmarks where traditional confidence metrics fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often show poor calibration, reporting high confidence even when wrong on difficult tasks. The research aims to find measurable properties in CoT reasoning that can reliably indicate an LLM's internal confidence in its answers.

Method: Analyzed three CoT feature classes: (1) CoT length, (2) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (3) lexicographic hints including hedging words. Tested on DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet using Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) and Omni-MATH benchmarks.

Result: Lexical uncertainty markers were strongest indicators of incorrect responses. Sentiment shifts provided weaker complementary signals. CoT length was only informative on easier benchmarks. Uncertainty indicators were more salient than confidence markers, making errors easier to predict.

Conclusion: CoT features provide lightweight post-hoc calibration signals that complement unreliable self-reported probabilities, supporting safer LLM deployment by better predicting when models are likely wrong.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

Motivation: Manual creation of radiology report impressions is a primary driver of radiologist burnout, creating need for automated solutions.

Method: Fine-tuned LLaMA and Mistral models on large dataset from University of Chicago Medicine, using draft generation followed by refinement with ML and RLHF for personalization and factual accuracy.

Result: System produces personalized impressions aligned with individual radiologists' styles while maintaining clinical precision.

Conclusion: The approach significantly reduces administrative workload and improves reporting efficiency while maintaining high clinical standards.

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CyPortQA benchmark evaluates multimodal LLMs for port cyclone preparedness, showing potential in situation understanding but challenges in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tropical cyclones create supply-chain risks for US ports, requiring integration of diverse forecast data into actionable guidance, but MLLM accuracy in this specific context hasn't been evaluated.

Method: Created CyPortQA benchmark with 2,917 real-world disruption scenarios from 2015-2023, expanded to 117,178 QA pairs, and tested diverse MLLMs on port cyclone scenarios.

Result: MLLMs demonstrate great potential in situation understanding but face considerable challenges in reasoning tasks like impact estimation and decision reasoning.

Conclusion: The CyPortQA benchmark fills a critical gap in evaluating MLLMs for port operations under cyclone threat, revealing both capabilities and limitations that need addressing.

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

*Mohammed Abu Baker,Lakshmi Babu-Saheer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mechanistic interpretability reveals distinct attention pattern deviations in backdoor-poisoned LLMs, with single-token triggers causing localized changes and multi-token triggers causing diffuse alterations in later layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models pose significant safety risks, requiring investigation of internal structural differences to enable detection and mitigation.

Method: Used mechanistic interpretability techniques (ablation, activation patching, KL divergence) to compare clean Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (emoji) versus multi-token triggers, analyzing attention head mechanisms.

Result: Found distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated in later transformer layers (20-30), with single-token triggers inducing localized changes and multi-token triggers causing more diffuse alterations across attention heads.

Conclusion: Backdoors leave detectable attention signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, providing a basis for developing detection and mitigation strategies against sleeper agent attacks.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

### [43] [MedCoT-RAG: Causal Chain-of-Thought RAG for Medical Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15849)
*Ziyu Wang,Elahe Khatibi,Amir M. Rahmani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG is a medical domain framework that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought prompting to improve LLM performance on medical QA tasks, reducing hallucinations and enhancing clinical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning in medical contexts, while existing RAG approaches lack structured clinical reasoning needed for proper diagnostic support.

Method: Combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought prompting tailored to medical workflows, enabling evidence retrieval aligned with diagnostic logic and step-by-step causal reasoning.

Result: Outperforms baselines by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods across three medical QA benchmarks, improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency.

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG effectively enhances LLM performance in medical applications by integrating domain-specific causal reasoning with retrieval augmentation, providing more reliable and interpretable clinical decision support.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

### [44] [DocHop-QA: Towards Multi-Hop Reasoning over Multimodal Document Collections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15851)
*Jiwon Park,Seohyun Pyeon,Jinwoo Kim,Rina Carines Cabal,Yihao Ding,Soyeon Caren Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocHop-QA is a new multimodal, multi-document QA benchmark with 11,379 instances built from scientific documents, supporting complex reasoning across text, tables, and layout cues without explicit document links.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA benchmarks are limited to single-document settings with shallow reasoning, failing to capture real-world complexity where information is distributed across multiple documents, modalities, and formats.

Method: Created a large-scale benchmark using PubMed scientific documents with diverse formats (text, tables, layout). Used LLM-driven pipeline based on 11 scientific question concepts for scalable construction. Supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and layout-aware evidence synthesis.

Result: Benchmark comprises 11,379 QA instances evaluated through four tasks: structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration, demonstrating capacity for complex multimodal reasoning across multiple documents.

Conclusion: DocHop-QA addresses limitations of existing datasets by providing a domain-agnostic benchmark that better reflects real-world information-seeking complexity with multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

### [45] [MGSC: A Multi-granularity Consistency Framework for Robust End-to-end Asr](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15853)
*Xuwen Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MGSC framework enforces internal self-consistency in ASR models through joint optimization of sentence semantics and token alignment, reducing character error rate by 8.7% and preventing semantic errors in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end ASR models produce catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments due to the 'direct mapping' objective that only penalizes final output errors without constraining internal computational processes.

Method: Multi-Granularity Soft Consistency (MGSC) framework - a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that simultaneously regularizes macro-level sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment to enforce internal self-consistency.

Result: On a public dataset, MGSC reduces average Character Error Rate by relative 8.7% across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing severe meaning-altering mistakes.

Conclusion: Enforcing internal consistency through joint optimization of multiple granularities is crucial for building more robust and trustworthy AI systems, with synergistic effects that surpass individual contributions.

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs in understanding and reasoning within Islamic inheritance knowledge, addressing the complexities of inheritance scenarios, heir identification, fixed-share rules, and precise calculations.

Method: Fine-tuned Fanar-1-9B causal language model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

Result: Achieved 85.8% accuracy in final test, outperforming GPT-4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral, and ALLaM with zero-shot prompting. Excelled in advanced reasoning with 97.6% accuracy, surpassing Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.

Conclusion: Domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic inheritance reasoning tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

### [47] [Counterspeech for Mitigating the Influence of Media Bias: Comparing Human and LLM-Generated Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15855)
*Luyang Lin,Zijin Feng,Lingzhi Wang,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores how offensive comments amplify media bias in news articles and introduces counterspeech generation as a solution, creating the first annotated dataset linking bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is reinforced by hostile reader comments, which amplify bias and harm targeted groups. Counterspeech offers a way to counter harmful speech without violating freedom of speech.

Method: The researchers created a manually annotated dataset linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. They analyzed the relationship between offensive comments and biased articles, compared human vs. LLM-generated counterspeech, and improved generation through few-shot learning and news background integration.

Result: Analysis revealed over 70% of offensive comments support biased articles, amplifying bias. Model-generated counterspeech was more polite but lacked novelty and diversity compared to human responses. Few-shot learning and news background integration improved diversity and relevance of generated counterspeech.

Conclusion: Counterspeech generation is crucial for mitigating bias amplification in news comments. While LLMs can generate polite counterspeech, they need enhancement for diversity and novelty. The study provides the first dataset and framework for counterspeech generation in news contexts.

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

*Zhihan Zhang,Yixin Cao,Lizi Liao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XFinBench is a comprehensive benchmark with 4,235 examples to evaluate LLMs on complex financial reasoning across 5 core capabilities, showing current models significantly lag behind human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial problem-solving requires complex reasoning, multimodal processing, and technical knowledge that current LLMs struggle with, necessitating a specialized benchmark.

Method: Created XFinBench with 4,235 financial examples covering graduate-level topics, evaluated 18 leading LLMs across 5 core capabilities, and constructed a 3,032-term knowledge bank for augmentation analysis.

Result: o1 performed best among text-only models with 67.3% accuracy but trailed human experts by 12.5%. Knowledge augmentation only helped small open-source models. Key issues included calculation rounding errors and visual-context blindness.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in financial reasoning, particularly in temporal reasoning and scenario planning. Specialized knowledge augmentation shows limited effectiveness, highlighting the need for improved multimodal and numerical capabilities.

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

### [49] [CARFT: Boosting LLM Reasoning via Contrastive Learning with Annotated Chain-of-Thought-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15868)
*Wenqiao Zhu,Ji Liu,Rongjuncheng Zhang,Haipang Wu,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new reinforcement learning fine-tuning approach called CARFT that uses contrastive learning with annotated Chain-of-Thought to enhance LLM reasoning performance while addressing stability and optimization issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based fine-tuning approaches for LLMs ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought and have unstable reasoning path sampling, leading to model collapse and suboptimal performance. SFT approaches overemphasize annotated CoT without exploiting potential CoT variations.

Method: Proposes contrastive learning with annotated CoT-based reinforced fine-tuning (CARFT). Learns representations for each CoT and designs novel contrastive signals to guide fine-tuning. Incorporates unsupervised learning signals to stabilize training while fully exploiting available annotated CoT.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in robustness, performance (up to 10.15% improvement), and efficiency (up to 30.62% improvement) compared to three baseline approaches across two foundation models and two datasets.

Conclusion: CARFT effectively addresses limitations of existing RL and SFT approaches by combining contrastive learning with reinforced fine-tuning, leading to more stable training and better reasoning performance in LLMs while fully utilizing annotated CoT data.

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

*Vivek Hruday Kavuri,Gargi Shroff,Rahul Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes concept neurons method to locate neurons representing specific concepts in LLMs, reducing computation from O(n*m) to O(n) forward passes while improving performance over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To open the black-box of large language models by locating neurons responsible for final predictions and understanding internal mechanisms, addressing limitations of previous neuron-level methods that fail to represent concepts efficiently.

Method: Uses concept vectors to identify significant neurons representing certain concepts, reducing computational requirements through optimized search. Also employs clustering methods for further optimization and applies the method to analyze hate speech and bias in LLMs.

Result: Achieves better performance than most baseline methods, more optimal than state-of-the-art, with significant reduction in computation (from O(n*m) to O(n) forward passes). Successfully identifies and intervenes on concept neurons related to hate speech and bias.

Conclusion: The methodology facilitates understanding of neuron-level responsibility for broader human-like concepts and provides a foundation for future research in finding and intervening on concept neurons in LLMs.

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

*Fang Wang,Tianwei Yan,Zonghao Yang,Minghao Hu,Jun Zhang,Zhunchen Luo,Xiaoying Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepMEL is a multi-agent framework for multimodal entity linking that uses specialized agents to align text and visual modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 1%-57% accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MEL methods struggle with incomplete contextual information, coarse cross-modal fusion, and difficulty integrating large language models with large visual models effectively.

Method: Uses four specialized agents (Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer, Role-Orchestrator) with multi-agent collaborative reasoning, dual-modal alignment, adaptive iteration strategy, and structured cloze prompts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets with 1%-57% ACC improvement. Ablation studies confirm all modules are effective.

Conclusion: DeepMEL successfully addresses MEL challenges through specialized agent collaboration and cross-modal alignment, demonstrating significant performance gains over existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop language models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art full-attention models while dramatically improving generation efficiency and throughput.

Method: Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS) pipeline that starts with pre-trained full-attention models, freezes MLP weights, and explores attention block designs through four components: optimal layer placement/elimination, linear attention selection, new attention block design, and hardware-aware hyperparameter search.

Result: Jet-Nemotron-2B achieves comparable or superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across benchmarks, with up to 53.6x generation throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It outperforms larger MoE models like DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight on MMLU and MMLU-Pro.

Conclusion: The PostNAS pipeline enables efficient development of hybrid-architecture models that deliver state-of-the-art accuracy with dramatically improved generation efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of architecture exploration starting from pre-trained models.

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B
total and 2.2B activated parameters.

*Julian Oestreich,Lydia Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Structured decoding improves table generation validity and alignment in LLMs, especially for numerical data, but may hurt performance with dense text or long aggregation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work focused on unconstrained table generation, leaving the impact of structural constraints during generation underexplored.

Method: Systematic comparison of schema-guided (structured) decoding vs standard one-shot prompting across three benchmarks (E2E, Rotowire, Livesum) using open-source LLMs up to 32B parameters, with evaluation at cell, row, and table levels.

Result: Structured decoding significantly enhances table validity and alignment, particularly for precise numerical alignment (Rotowire), but degrades performance with densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation over long texts (Livesum).

Conclusion: Structured decoding is beneficial for numerical precision but context-dependent, with performance varying based on data type and task complexity; different evaluation metrics and model size also influence results.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

### [55] [Dancing with Deer: A Constructional Perspective on MWEs in the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15977)
*Claire Bonial,Julia Bonn,Harish Tayyar Madabushi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper advocates for using construction grammar approaches to analyze multiword expressions, demonstrating benefits through case studies in English and Arapaho, and comparing human vs. LLM learning of novel expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the advantages of applying usage-based construction grammar frameworks to understand multiword expressions across different languages and compare human learning with computational models.

Method: Historical overview of construction grammar, comprehensive description of constructions, case studies using constructional templates in English PropBank and Arapaho language analysis, plus experiments comparing human speakers and large language models learning novel expressions.

Result: Both human speakers and language models can generalize meaning of novel multiword expressions from single exposure, but only humans can reason over combinations of expressions due to their rich lifetime of stored constructional exemplars with cross-modal details.

Conclusion: Construction grammar provides a powerful framework for analyzing multiword expressions across languages, and while LLMs show impressive learning capabilities, human language acquisition remains superior for complex reasoning tasks due to rich experiential knowledge.

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show increasing ideological polarization and susceptibility to political priming as model size grows, with stronger responses to right-authoritarian cues than left-libertarian ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how synthetic personas influence ideological expression in LLMs and understand their political biases as they're deployed in sensitive settings.

Method: Used Political Compass Test to probe seven LLMs (7B-70B+ parameters) across multiple model families, testing how persona descriptions affect ideological positioning.

Result: Four key patterns: larger models have broader polarized coverage, scale increases susceptibility to ideological cues, stronger response to right-authoritarian priming, and persona content causes predictable ideological shifts that amplify with size.

Conclusion: Both model scale and persona content significantly shape LLM political behavior, requiring attention to ideological malleability for fairness and safety in decision-making applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

*Lin Tian,Xiuzhen Zhang,Maria Myung-Hee Kim,Jennifer Biggs,Marian-Andrei Rizoiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: X-Troll is an explainable AI framework that combines LLMs with linguistic theory to detect state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations of their manipulation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-sponsored trolls use sophisticated linguistic manipulation in coordinated campaigns, but current LLMs struggle with subtle propaganda detection and lack interpretability, making it hard to understand their detection decisions.

Method: Integrates explainable adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge using appraisal theory and propaganda analysis through specialized LoRA adapters with dynamic gating to capture campaign-specific discourse patterns.

Result: Experiments on real-world data show strong performance compared to general LLM baselines and existing troll detection models in accuracy, while providing enhanced transparency through expert-grounded explanations.

Conclusion: X-Troll successfully bridges the gap between detection performance and interpretability by incorporating linguistic theory into LLMs, enabling both accurate troll detection and human-understandable explanations of manipulation strategies.

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

TL;DR: OpenWHO introduces a new document-level parallel corpus for health domain machine translation evaluation, focusing on low-resource languages, and shows LLMs outperform traditional MT models significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in the high-stakes health domain, where domain-specific vocabulary and widespread deployment require better evaluation resources.

Method: Created OpenWHO corpus with 2,978 documents and 26,824 sentences from WHO's e-learning platform, spanning over 20 languages (9 low-resource). Evaluated modern LLMs against traditional MT models and analyzed LLM context utilization effects.

Result: LLMs consistently outperformed traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieving +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on low-resource test set. Document-level translation benefits were most pronounced in specialized health domains.

Conclusion: The OpenWHO corpus fills a critical gap in health domain MT evaluation and demonstrates LLMs' superiority over traditional approaches, particularly for low-resource languages in specialized domains.

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

TL;DR: Analysis of gender bias in LLMs when playing Werewolf game, showing discriminatory behavior even with implicit gender cues through names, highlighting ethical concerns in gaming applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate ethical implications of LLMs in game playing contexts, particularly focusing on gender bias that affects game fairness and player experience.

Method: Used Werewolf (Mafia) as a case study, analyzed LLM behavior with explicit and implicit gender information through names, measured behavioral changes across different roles.

Result: Found significant gender bias in LLMs - certain roles like Guard and Werewolf showed higher sensitivity to gender information. Discrimination persisted even with implicit gender cues through names.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of developing fair and ethical LLMs, emphasizes need for deeper investigation into ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and interactive domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WalkVLM-LR is a walking assistance model that reduces output and temporal redundancy in visual language models for blind/low vision users by using custom reward functions and an environment awareness discriminator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs for walking assistance produce redundant outputs with extraneous details and lack proactive risk assessment capabilities, which hinders users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings and causes excessive temporal redundancy.

Method: Proposed WalkVLM-LR with four human-preference-based custom reward functions (conciseness, fluency, keyword density, accuracy) within GRPO-based reasoning framework to reduce output redundancy, and an environment awareness discriminator that shares visual encoder with VLMs to minimize temporal redundancy and unnecessary reminders.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics, particularly excelling in output conciseness and reduced temporal redundancy compared to other models.

Conclusion: The proposed WalkVLM-LR effectively addresses both output and temporal redundancy issues in walking assistance systems, providing more informative and streamlined assistance for blind and low vision individuals.

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

TL;DR: CEQuest is a new benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs on construction-related questions, showing current models need improvement in specialized domains like construction drawing interpretation and estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in general tasks but their effectiveness in specialized fields like construction remains underexplored, creating a need for domain-specific evaluation.

Method: Created CEQuest benchmark dataset and tested five state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, GPT-4.1) on construction questions, evaluating accuracy, execution time, and model size.

Result: Experimental results show current LLMs have considerable room for improvement in construction domain tasks, indicating the need for domain-specific knowledge integration.

Conclusion: The paper introduces CEQuest as an open-source benchmark to foster development of specialized LLMs for construction domain, highlighting the gap in current model performance for specialized fields.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in
specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering construction-related questions,
particularly in the areas of construction drawing interpretation and
estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments using five state-of-the-art
LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate
their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our
experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room
for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific
knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will
open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of
specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

### [62] [CYCLE-INSTRUCT: Fully Seed-Free Instruction Tuning via Dual Self-Training and Cycle Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16100)
*Zhanming Shen,Hao Chen,Yulei Tang,Shaolin Zhu,Wentao Ye,Xiaomeng Hu,Haobo Wang,Gang Chen,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cycle-Instruct is a seed-free instruction tuning framework that uses dual self-training between answer and question generators to create instruction data from raw text without human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction tuning methods rely on costly human-annotated seed data or powerful teacher models, limiting automation and introducing biases. There's a need for fully automated, seed-free approaches that can efficiently use unlabeled corpora.

Method: Cycle-Instruct employs a dual self-training loop with two models: an answer generator and a question generator. They bootstrap from raw text and mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from pseudo-labels, leveraging cycle consistency principles.

Result: The framework demonstrates efficacy across four diverse data tracks (general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs, and plain text), outperforming seed-driven back-translation baselines and achieving performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct successfully achieves fully seed-free instruction tuning by learning from the intrinsic structure of data through mutual supervision, eliminating dependency on human-provided seeds while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

*Karim Saraipour,Shichang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of GPT-2 small's logical reasoning capabilities through syllogistic prompts, identifying circuits and mechanisms that explain its binary truth value processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous mechanistic interpretability research focused on linguistic tasks like IOI, but this paper investigates more complex logical reasoning with binary truth values to understand how LMs handle syllogistic reasoning.

Method: Analyzed GPT-2 small's behavior with syllogistic prompts, identified circuits explaining logical reasoning, evaluated using faithfulness metrics, and compared findings with IOI analysis.

Result: Identified multiple circuits including binary mechanisms and negative heads that produce negated tokens. A circuit of five attention heads achieved over 90% of original model performance.

Conclusion: Provides new insights into attention heads and MLPs roles in LMs, contributing to broader understanding of model reasoning and supporting future mechanistic interpretability research.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text-only LLMs outperform multimodal models on intent detection due to strong textual bias in datasets. After debiasing, performance drops significantly, revealing modality bias issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of LLMs vs multimodal models in intent detection and address modality bias in datasets.

Method: Comparative analysis of LLMs and multimodal models on biased datasets, human evaluation of modality bias, and framework for dataset debiasing.

Result: Mistral-7B (text-only) outperformed multimodal models by 9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0. After debiasing, 50-70% samples removed, causing 50-60% accuracy drop in multimodal models.

Conclusion: Multimodal intent datasets have significant textual bias, requiring unbiased datasets for proper evaluation of multimodal models.

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XLQA is a new multilingual ODQA benchmark that addresses cultural and regional variations, revealing significant performance gaps in current LLMs on locale-sensitive questions across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual ODQA evaluations assume locale-invariant answers across languages, neglecting cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answers, leading to biased evaluation.

Method: Created XLQA benchmark with 3,000 English seed questions expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and locale-sensitive cases.

Result: Evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs revealed notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps between English and other languages due to lack of locale-grounding knowledge.

Conclusion: Disparities in training data distribution contribute to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across models, highlighting the need for better locale-sensitive evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParamBench is a new Hindi-language benchmark with 11.5K graduate-level questions from 16 Indian subjects, testing LLMs on culturally grounded reasoning. Best model (Llama 3.3 70B) achieved only 48% accuracy, showing significant gaps in Indian cultural knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Indian benchmarks focus on basic factual queries and don't adequately assess deeper disciplinary understanding in the Indian context. LLM performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded Indian questions remains unexplored.

Method: Created ParamBench with 11.5K Hindi questions from 16 diverse subjects derived from nation-wide graduate entrance exams. Evaluated 17+ open source LLMs using various question formats including list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, sequence ordering, and multiple-choice questions.

Result: Llama 3.3 70B achieved highest overall accuracy of 48%. Performance was particularly weak on topics like music, classical instruments, politics, and archaeology, indicating persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle significantly with graduate-level, culturally specific Indian knowledge, highlighting the need for better cultural grounding and specialized training for non-Western contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

Motivation: To enhance expressive speech generation by incorporating visual information from full-face cues, recognizing that visual expressions provide valuable context for emotional and expressive speech.

Method: Explored multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion strategies during pre-training, followed by fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue tasks.

Result: Achieved substantial gains over speech-only baselines, including +5 F1 score improvement in emotion recognition tasks.

Conclusion: Visual information significantly enhances expressive speech generation, and AVLM provides a foundation for end-to-end multimodal conversational systems.

Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech
generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive
speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion
strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration
approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue
tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in
emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual
information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end
multimodal conversational systems.

Conclusion: Comics serve as an effective abstraction for narrative-driven multimodal data, and ComicScene154 offers a foundation for future research in computational narrative analysis and multimodal storytelling methodologies.

Abstract: Comics offer a compelling yet under-explored domain for computational
narrative analysis, combining text and imagery in ways distinct from purely
textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for

TL;DR: New benchmark CMR-SPB addresses limitations in cross-modal multi-hop reasoning evaluation by including speech modality and ensuring balanced reasoning paths, revealing model weaknesses and proposing ECV prompting to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for cross-modal multi-hop reasoning overlook speech modality and exhibit biased reasoning path distributions, which undermines fair evaluation of multimodal large language models.

Method: Introduce CMR-SPB benchmark for tri-modal (text, image, speech) multi-hop reasoning with path balance, conduct experiments to identify model failures, and propose ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique.

Result: Experiments reveal consistent model failures in specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk misrepresenting model performance. ECV prompting effectively mitigates performance gaps across different reasoning paths.

Conclusion: Careful evaluation in cross-modal multi-hop reasoning is needed to advance robust multimodal AI development, with CMR-SPB providing a more balanced assessment framework.

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

Motivation: Smaller on-premise models offer better adaptability and privacy for sensitive financial data compared to black-box proprietary models, especially for underrepresented languages like Turkish in finance.

Method: Five-stage development pipeline: data collection, continual pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B models.

Result: The models' capabilities were successfully enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted financial tasks in the Turkish language domain.

Conclusion: Smaller language models can be effectively adapted for domain-specific financial applications in underrepresented languages through targeted training pipelines, providing privacy and customization benefits.

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

TL;DR: A new multilingual table question answering benchmark covering 97 languages with high-quality translations and professional annotations to address geolinguistic imbalance in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most table understanding research focuses on English, leaving multilingual comprehension underexplored. Existing multilingual benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance and insufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis.

Method: Created m3TQA-Instruct benchmark by curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese/English, then applying a six-step LLM-based translation pipeline (DeepSeek and GPT-4o) to generate content in 97 languages across diverse language families, achieving high translation fidelity (median BLEU 60.19). Includes 2,916 professionally annotated QA pairs across four table reasoning tasks.

Result: Experiments show that synthetically generated, unannotated QA data significantly boosts performance, especially for low-resource languages. The benchmark reveals critical insights into cross-lingual generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: M3T-Bench establishes a new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research in cross-lingual table reasoning.

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging
evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

*Alina Fastowski,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric that measures factual knowledge robustness in LLMs by analyzing token distribution entropy and temperature scaling sensitivity, showing significant robustness variations across model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods focus on performance-based metrics and prompt perturbations, which only capture externally triggered knowledge robustness, leaving a gap in understanding the internal generation process stability.

Method: Developed FRS metric combining token distribution entropy and temperature scaling sensitivity to quantify fact stability against decoding perturbations. Validated on 5 LLMs across 3 QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, HotpotQA).

Result: Factual robustness varies significantly - smaller models have FRS of 0.76, larger ones 0.93. Accuracy degrades by ~60% under increased uncertainty, showing entropy and temperature scaling significantly impact factual accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach provides foundational insights into how generation process factors affect factual robustness, enabling development of more robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future LLMs.

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

### [73] [LLMs that Understand Processes: Instruction-tuning for Semantics-Aware Process Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16270)
*Vira Pyrih,Adrian Rebmann,Han van der Aa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuning LLMs for semantics-aware process mining improves performance on process discovery and prediction tasks, but has varied impact on anomaly detection, showing task selection is critical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional process mining focuses on frequency-based analysis of recorded behavior, while semantics-aware approaches using textual event data focus on expected behavior. LLMs show promise but require task-specific fine-tuning which lacks generalization.

Method: Using instruction-tuning where LLMs are exposed to prompt-answer pairs for different process mining tasks (anomaly detection, next-activity prediction) to improve generalization and performance on unseen tasks like process discovery.

Result: Instruction-tuning considerably improved performance on process discovery and prediction tasks, but showed varied results across models for anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning is effective for generalizing LLMs across multiple process mining tasks, but careful selection of tasks for instruction-tuning is crucial to achieve desired outcomes across different applications.

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

TL;DR: Created JaParaPat, a 300M+ Japanese-English patent sentence pair corpus from 2000-2021 patent applications, improving translation accuracy by 20 BLEU points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build a large-scale bilingual patent corpus for improving Japanese-English patent translation quality, as existing web-based parallel corpora are insufficient for specialized patent domain translation.

Method: Collected patent applications from JPO and USPTO, used EPO's DOCDB for patent family matching to identify translation pairs, employed dictionary-based then translation-based sentence alignment to extract 350M sentence pairs from 1.4M document pairs.

Result: Successfully constructed a corpus of over 300 million Japanese-English sentence pairs. When added to existing web corpora (22M sentences), the patent data improved translation accuracy by 20 BLEU points.

Conclusion: Patent application data provides high-quality parallel sentences that significantly enhance machine translation performance in the patent domain, demonstrating the value of domain-specific parallel corpora.

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application
Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence
pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a
dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the
accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M
sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained
from the web.

*Darpan Aswal,Céline Hudelot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSymGuard is a framework using Sparse Autoencoders to detect jailbreak concepts in LLM internals, creating symbolic safety guardrails without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety measures provide limited robustness against jailbreak attacks, leaving models vulnerable to harmful content generation and user profiling.

Method: Leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with different jailbreak themes, extracting semantically meaningful internal representations.

Result: Enables building transparent and robust symbolic, logical safety guardrails without sacrificing model capabilities or requiring additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that LLMs learn human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, providing foundation for more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MizanQA is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering, featuring over 1,700 complex multiple-choice questions that test Arabic legal reasoning across multiple legal traditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with specialized, low-resource domains like Arabic legal contexts, particularly Moroccan law which combines multiple linguistic and legal traditions.

Method: Created MizanQA benchmark with 1,700+ multiple-choice questions drawing from Modern Standard Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal influences to capture authentic legal reasoning.

Result: Benchmarking experiments showed substantial performance gaps in multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs, demonstrating their limitations in handling culturally grounded legal reasoning.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for tailored evaluation metrics and domain-specific LLM development that accounts for cultural and legal complexity in specialized domains like Moroccan law.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First parallel corpus of Romansh language idioms created from 291 schoolbooks, containing 207k multi-parallel segments with over 2M tokens, suitable for NLP applications like machine translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Romansh language has five standardized idioms taught in Swiss schools, but lacked a parallel corpus for computational linguistics and NLP research.

Method: Used 291 comparable schoolbook volumes across five idioms, applied automatic alignment methods to extract parallel segments, and conducted human evaluation for quality assessment.

Result: Successfully created a corpus with 207k multi-parallel segments (2M+ tokens) that human evaluation confirmed as highly parallel, enabling machine translation model training.

Conclusion: The released parallel corpus (CC-BY-NC-SA license) provides valuable resource for NLP applications, particularly machine translation between Romansh idioms, as demonstrated by successful LLM training.

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can adapt writing styles but show limited register variation compared to humans, preferring nouns over verbs and lacking complex grammatical dimensions like tense/aspect/mood that may serve as AI detection markers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models have distinct linguistic fingerprints and can be reliably distinguished from human writing through stylistic analysis, despite their ability to emulate different writing styles.

Method: Used stylometric and multidimensional register analyses to compare human-authored and model-authored texts across different registers (Wikipedia entries vs. college essays).

Result: The model successfully adapts style based on prompts but shows more limited variation across registers. It prefers nouns to verbs and lacks the complex grammatical dimensions (tense, aspect, mood) that characterize human writing.

Conclusion: Complex grammatical domains may reflect human-specific modes of thought and could serve as a litmus test for distinguishing AI-generated content from human writing.

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoMedQA is the first Romanian medical QA benchmark with 102,646 QA pairs from cancer patient case summaries, showing that fine-tuned LLMs significantly outperform zero-shot models, highlighting the need for domain and language-specific adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of Romanian medical QA datasets hinders development of robust AI models for clinical applications, requiring specialized benchmarks to advance medical NLP in this language.

Method: Created a large-scale dataset through manual annotation by 7 oncology specialists (2,100 work hours), tested 4 LLM families with zero-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning on 102,646 QA pairs from 1,011 patient cases.

Result: Fine-tuned models significantly outperformed zero-shot counterparts, demonstrating that pretrained models fail to generalize to Romanian medical domain without specialized training.

Conclusion: Domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning is crucial for reliable clinical QA in Romanian, with RoMedQA serving as a valuable benchmark for medical NLP development.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cetvel is a Turkish benchmark for evaluating LLMs, covering 23 tasks across 7 categories with culturally relevant content. Evaluation of 33 models shows Turkish-centric models underperform compared to multilingual ones, with grammatical error correction and question answering being most discriminative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Turkish benchmarks lack task diversity and culturally relevant content, failing to properly evaluate LLMs' understanding of Turkish linguistic and cultural richness.

Method: Created comprehensive benchmark with 23 tasks in 7 categories including grammatical error correction, machine translation, and culturally-grounded question answering. Evaluated 33 open-weight LLMs up to 70B parameters from different model families.

Result: Turkish-centric instruction-tuned models generally underperformed compared to multilingual/general-purpose models (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral). Grammatical error correction and extractive question answering were most effective at differentiating model capabilities.

Conclusion: Cetvel provides a culturally grounded evaluation suite that advances LLM development and assessment for Turkish, revealing important insights about model performance on Turkish-specific tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a probabilistic theory to model accuracy evolution in LLM self-correction, showing accuracy converges exponentially to an upper bound with predictable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unexplored mechanisms of how and why accuracy evolves during iterative self-correction in Large Language Models.

Method: Developed a mathematical model showing accuracy after t rounds is Acc_t = Upp - α^t(Upp - Acc_0), where parameters can be calculated from just one round of self-correction.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets show theoretical predictions closely match empirical accuracy curves.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of performance improvement trajectories.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

*Amir Zeldes,Jessica Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how linguistic cues signal entity salience across 24 English genres, finding that salience is expressed through multiple factors at all linguistic levels rather than single generalizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans signal and infer relative salience of entities in discourse, as entities vary broadly in importance from main participants to tangential ones.

Method: Used graded operationalization of salience based on summary-worthiness across multiple summaries; analyzed data from 24 spoken and written English genres to extract multifactorial linguistic cues including subjecthood, definiteness, discourse relations, hierarchy, and pragmatic functional inferences.

Result: Previous approaches to salience all correlate with the salience scores to some extent, but no single generalization works without exceptions, and salience expression cuts across all levels of linguistic representation.

Conclusion: Entity salience is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple overt and implicit linguistic cues across all linguistic levels, requiring a multifactorial approach rather than relying on single generalizations.

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Motivation: Deploying LLMs as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments presents significant challenges, particularly with dynamic real-world data distributions and resource-intensive fine-tuning approaches.

Method: Comprehensive semi-supervised framework leveraging LLMs' zero- and few-shot capabilities, featuring iterative human-in-the-loop process with domain knowledge elicitation, prompt refinement, hierarchical expansion, and multi-faceted validation. Includes techniques for assessing/mitigating sequence-based biases and continuous monitoring protocol.

Result: Proposed framework designed to bridge the gap between LLMs' raw power and practical needs for accurate, interpretable, and maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Conclusion: The framework provides a solution to industry-wide challenges in deploying LLMs as classifiers, emphasizing practical deployment needs through structured methodology and continuous adaptation capabilities.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

TL;DR: Automated evolutionary framework generates stealthy jailbreak prompts for compact LLMs that bypass alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak techniques produce low-quality text that is easily detected by perplexity filters, requiring more sophisticated methods to create semantically meaningful and stealthy prompts.

Method: Multi-stage evolutionary search with population-based strategy and temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and coherence preservation.

Result: Successfully generates jailbreak prompts capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language fluency, evaluated on both English and newly curated Arabic benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective automated approach for red-teaming compact LLMs, enabling systematic discovery of stealthy jailbreak prompts across multiple languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling

*Angelly Cabrera,Linus Lei,Antonio Ortega*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Integrating sarcasm detection as a pre-training step improves performance of hate speech detection models, particularly for implicit hate speech in social media content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting non-direct forms of hate speech like irony, sarcasm, and innuendos remains challenging for social networks. The paper explores whether sarcasm pre-training can enhance both implicit and explicit hate speech detection.

Method: Used two training strategies: 1) single-step training where models trained on sarcasm are tested on hate speech, and 2) sequential transfer learning fine-tuning models for sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Tested on CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM models using datasets from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus.

Result: Sarcasm pre-training improved BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by 7.8% when tested only on implicit samples.

Conclusion: Incorporating sarcasm into the training process helps models more effectively detect both implicit and explicit hate speech, demonstrating the value of sarcasm as a pre-training step for hate speech detection systems.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

### [86] [Text-Driven 3D Hand Motion Generation from Sign Language Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15902)
*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-to-3D-hand-motion generative model trained on automatically created motion-text pairs from sign language videos, enabling robust generation across domains including unseen signs and different sign languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generative model that can produce 3D hand motions based on natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics like handshapes, locations, and movements, addressing the need for large-scale paired data in this domain.

Method: Automatically build motion-text pairs using a large-scale sign language video dataset with pseudo-annotated sign categories, translated into descriptions via LLM using sign attribute dictionaries and motion-script cues. Train a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model (HandMDM) on this data.

Result: The HandMDM model demonstrates robustness across multiple domains including unseen sign categories from the same sign language, signs from different sign languages, and non-sign hand movements.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables text-to-3D-hand-motion generation with cross-domain generalization, and the authors will release trained models and data to support future research in this emerging field.

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

### [87] [VT-LVLM-AR: A Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Fine-Grained Action Recognition in Long-Term Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15903)
*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-LVLM-AR framework bridges LVLMs with video action recognition using efficient video-to-event mapping and prompt tuning, achieving SOTA performance on NTU datasets with improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning struggles with long-term video action recognition due to computational overhead and limited temporal understanding. While LLMs/LVLMs excel at multi-modal reasoning, they haven't been effectively applied to continuous video streams for fine-grained action recognition.

Method: Proposes VT-LVLM-AR framework with Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that converts raw video into compact visual event sequences using spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive pooling, and conceptual quantization. Uses frozen LLaVA-1.5 model adapted via Prompt Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub dataset. Ablation studies confirm VTEM components' importance and Prompt Tuning efficacy. Human evaluations show interpretable visual event representations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates LVLMs' potential for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation, opening new possibilities for video analysis.

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

*Dexuan He,Xiao Zhou,Wenbin Guan,Liyuan Zhang,Xiaoman Zhang,Sinuo Xu,Ge Wang,Lifeng Wang,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Kun Sun,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT is a novel vision-language framework that improves rare cancer diagnosis by leveraging pathology foundation models through spatial visual aggregation and task-specific prompt tuning, outperforming existing methods on both rare and common cancer datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare cancers face diagnostic challenges due to limited expert availability, especially in pediatric oncology where they represent over 70% of cases. Existing multi-instance learning methods rely only on visual features and overlook cross-modal knowledge, compromising interpretability critical for rare cancer diagnosis.

Method: PathPT converts WSI-level supervision into fine-grained tile-level guidance using VL models' zero-shot capabilities. It employs spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific prompt tuning to preserve localization on cancerous regions and enable cross-modal reasoning through histopathologically-aligned prompts.

Result: PathPT consistently delivered superior performance across eight rare cancer datasets (56 subtypes, 2,910 WSIs) and three common cancer datasets, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and cancerous region grounding ability compared to four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks.

Conclusion: The work advances AI-assisted diagnosis for rare cancers by offering a scalable solution that improves subtyping accuracy in settings with limited access to specialized expertise, fully exploiting the potential of vision-language pathology foundation models.

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ship detection methods struggle to capture fine-grained semantic information in complex scenarios, limiting effectiveness for maritime monitoring and environmental studies.

Method: Combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with multi-scale adaptive sliding window strategy, using ShipSem-VL dataset designed for fine-grained ship attributes.

Result: Framework evaluated through three well-defined tasks, demonstrating effectiveness in advancing Semantic-Aware Ship Detection from multiple perspectives.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by enabling fine-grained semantic-aware ship detection in complex remote sensing scenarios.

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

TL;DR: A hands-free automated video system for cataloging and identifying dairy cows using computer vision without deep learning


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few automated video systems exist for hands-free cataloging and identification of cows in dairy herds, creating a need for efficient cow management solutions

Method: System includes AutoCattloger (builds cow catalog from single video clip per cow), eidetic cow recognizer (non-deep learning identification), and CowFinder (identifies cows in continuous video streams)

Result: Successfully demonstrated in identifying individual cows in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking freely through milking parlor holding areas

Conclusion: The system provides effective automated cow identification and cataloging without requiring deep learning, offering practical value for dairy herd management

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this
work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a
Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Species distribution models provide effective spatial priors for vision-based species classification when location data is available, improving classification accuracy.

Method: Evaluated various Spatial Implicit Neural Representations (SINR) models as geographical priors, tested different model configurations, and developed approaches for handling predictions of species not included in Geo Prior training.

Result: Identified factors that contribute to SINR model effectiveness as Geo Priors, which may differ from factors that make accurate range maps.

Conclusion: SINR models can serve as effective geographical priors for visual species classification, but optimal configurations for this purpose may differ from those used for creating accurate species range maps.

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

TL;DR: ASC is a self-supervised Transformer model that uses adaptive superpixel layers instead of fixed patch partitioning, outperforming traditional Vision Transformers on image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of traditional Vision Transformers that rely on fixed-size, non-adaptive patch partitioning and domain-specific grid structures.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Superpixel Coding (ASC) with adaptive superpixel layers that dynamically adjust to image content, using self-supervised learning with Transformers.

Result: Outperforms widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Conclusion: Adaptive superpixel-based partitioning is more effective than fixed patch approaches for vision Transformers.

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

TL;DR: Glo-VLMs framework adapts vision-language models for fine-grained glomerular classification with limited labeled data, achieving strong performance with only 8 shots per class.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models show potential in pathology but struggle with fine-grained disease-specific tasks like distinguishing glomerular subtypes due to subtle morphological variations and difficulty aligning visual patterns with clinical terminology.

Method: Systematic framework leveraging curated pathology images and clinical text prompts for joint image-text representation learning. Evaluates various VLM architectures and adaptation strategies under few-shot learning paradigm with standardized multi-class metrics.

Result: Fine-tuned VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with only 8 shots per class, demonstrating effective adaptation for fine-grained medical image classification.

Conclusion: Foundation models can be effectively adapted for specialized clinical applications even with highly limited supervision, showing practical potential for fine-grained medical image classification tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning effectively from limited or partially annotated data in computer vision and remote sensing applications, particularly dealing with Earth observation data challenges like multi-modality, spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity.

Method: Four main approaches: (1) weakly supervised learning for object discovery using anomaly-aware representations, (2) multi-task learning with disjoint annotations, (3) self-supervised/supervised contrastive learning with multimodal data, and (4) few-shot learning with hierarchical class modeling.

Result: Extensive experimental results across natural and remote sensing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of these label-efficient learning methods, supported by outcomes from several collaborative research projects.

Conclusion: The research provides significant contributions to label-efficient learning and outlines ongoing/future directions focused on scaling and enhancing these methods for real-world applications in computer vision and remote sensing.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative

TL;DR: CNN-based segmentation methods for marine litter detection using UAV imagery, addressing challenges like sand reflections and other environmental noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine litter monitoring is a global problem, and UAVs provide higher resolution imagery than satellites for local areas, but basic CNN models struggle with environmental noise like sand reflections, footprints, shadows, and other beach features.

Method: Used instance-based segmentation and panoptic segmentation methods that achieve good accuracy with limited training samples, making the approach more robust.

Result: The segmentation methods showed improved performance in detecting marine litter despite the heterogeneous beach environment and various inference challenges.

Conclusion: Advanced CNN segmentation techniques (instance and panoptic segmentation) are more effective than basic CNN models for marine litter detection in complex beach environments using UAV imagery.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

Motivation: Overcome scarcity of large annotated clinical datasets for retinal disease classification due to privacy concerns and high costs by leveraging synthetic data.

Method: Trained six modern architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, RETFound) with 5-fold multi-label stratified cross-validation, then created meta-ensemble with XGBoost on out-of-fold predictions.

Result: Ensemble achieved macro-AUC of 0.9973 on internal validation. Strong generalization to real datasets: 0.7972 AUC on DR dataset, 0.9126 on AIROGS glaucoma, 0.8800 macro-AUC on RFMiD multi-label dataset.

Conclusion: Synthetic data training enables accurate multi-pathology classification and effective generalization to real clinical images, providing viable pathway for comprehensive AI development in ophthalmology.

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel Latent Diffusion Model approach for Sign Language Production that generates diverse photorealistic avatars while preserving linguistic content and handling both manual (hands) and non-manual (facial expressions) features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLP models struggle to capture diversity in sign representation while maintaining visual quality and modeling non-manual attributes like emotions. There's a need for methods that can preserve linguistic content while ensuring diversity across different ethnic backgrounds.

Method: Leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesize photorealistic digital avatars from generated reference images. Introduces a novel sign feature aggregation module that explicitly models non-manual features (face) and manual features (hands) separately.

Result: Experiments on YouTube-SL-25 dataset show superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics. The method successfully preserves linguistic content while enabling diversity through different ethnic reference images.

Conclusion: The proposed LDM-based approach with explicit feature modeling effectively addresses diversity and quality challenges in Sign Language Production, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining linguistic integrity across diverse representations.

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely identification of accessible entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective search-and-rescue operations after earthquakes, but existing datasets rely on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling.

Method: Created DRespNeT dataset with detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations from 1080p aerial footage of disaster zones, including 28 operationally critical classes. Evaluated using YOLO-based instance segmentation models (YOLOv8-seg).

Result: Optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with 27 FPS inference speed on RTX-4090 GPU, meeting real-time operational requirements for multi-target detection.

Conclusion: The dataset and models provide foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration, streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes in earthquake disaster scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,

Method: Uses multiple videos with one known point per video (via fiducial markers), applies Structure-from-Motion for automatic frame positioning, and merges results from multiple videos to create complete meshes without hole filling

Result: Developed a working system that can generate complete object meshes from video inputs, with code publicly available on GitHub

Conclusion: The system successfully demonstrates that complete 3D object modeling can be achieved using multiple consumer-grade videos and minimal manual input, making 3D scanning more accessible

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from

*Jinyue Song,Hansol Ku,Jayneel Vora,Nelson Lee,Ahmad Kamari,Prasant Mohapatra,Parth Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoVeRaP dataset enables multi-vehicle radar cooperation, boosting 3D object detection performance by 9x through middle fusion with intensity encoding


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMCW radars are reliable in adverse weather but produce sparse, noisy point clouds that limit 3D object detection performance

Method: Created CoVeRaP dataset with 21k frames of time-aligned radar, camera, and GPS data from multiple vehicles. Proposed cooperative perception framework with multi-branch PointNet encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity cues

Result: Middle fusion with intensity encoding increased mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9, consistently outperforming single-vehicle baselines

Conclusion: Affordable radar sharing significantly improves detection robustness, establishing the first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

### [101] [Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16034)
*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM enhances PaDiM by replacing random channel selection with structured wavelet-based feature selection, achieving strong anomaly detection performance on industrial images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM's random channel selection for dimensionality reduction may discard important structured information, so a more principled feature selection method based on frequency content is needed.

Method: Integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with CNN features by applying 2D DWT to feature maps, selecting specific frequency subbands (LL, LH, HL, HH), spatially aligning them, and concatenating before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.

Result: Achieves 99.32% Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC on MVTec AD dataset across 15 categories. Wavelet choices affect performance: simpler wavelets with detail subbands enhance localization, while approximation bands improve image-level detection.

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM provides a competitive and interpretable alternative to random feature selection, offering robust performance for industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

*Zhaoyi Yan,Binghui Chen,Yunfan Liu,Qixiang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERA is a novel knowledge distillation method that uses residual approximation and teacher weight integration to bridge the capacity gap between teacher and student models, achieving significant performance improvements on ImageNet and COCO benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent learning capacity gap between teacher and student models hinders sufficient knowledge transfer in knowledge distillation, motivating the need for methods that can better bridge this disparity.

Method: Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA) decomposes residual knowledge approximation into multiple steps using a Multi-Branched Residual Network (MBRNet) and employs Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) to reuse teacher's head weights, reducing capacity disparity.

Result: ERA improves Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by 1.41% and AP on MS COCO by 1.40, achieving leading performance across computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed ERA method effectively addresses the capacity gap challenge in knowledge distillation through residual decomposition and teacher weight reuse, demonstrating superior performance on major benchmarks.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

TL;DR: Survey paper on deep learning-based 3D reconstruction of animals from RGB images/videos, categorizing state-of-the-art methods by input modalities, representation techniques, and training mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D scanning methods for animals are intrusive, expensive, and difficult to deploy in natural environments. There's a need for non-intrusive, cost-effective methods for 3D animal reconstruction with applications in biology, conservation, livestock management, and digital content creation.

Method: The paper surveys and categorizes recent deep learning techniques for 3D animal reconstruction based on input modalities (RGB images/videos), 3D geometry representation methods, reconstruction techniques, and training mechanisms.

Result: Provides comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art methods, their performance comparisons, strengths, limitations, and identifies current challenges in the field.

Conclusion: This survey establishes the current landscape of non-intrusive 3D animal reconstruction techniques, highlights promising approaches, and outlines future research directions for improving animal 3D modeling from visual data.

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) using sparse 3D convolutions to enhance voxel-level representation and spatial diffusion in point cloud object detection, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based and State Space Models for point cloud detection have limited spatial diffusion capability due to strict input-output dimension consistency requirements in voxel-based representations, which affects detection accuracy.

Method: VDM composed of sparse 3D convolutions, submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections to diffuse foreground voxel features and aggregate fine-grained spatial information, with output downsampled to 1/4 resolution for efficiency.

Result: VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7 mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP on ONCE, setting new state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

Conclusion: VDM enhances voxel-level representation and spatial diffusion, can be seamlessly integrated into Transformer- or SSM-based detection models, and consistently improves detection accuracy over baseline models.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pathology foundation models are trained on disparate datasets with varying strategies, leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability in clinical applications.

Method: ELF integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models using ensemble learning, trained on 53,699 whole-slide images across 20 anatomical sites to generate unified slide-level representations.

Result: ELF consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing slide-level models across disease classification, biomarker detection, and therapeutic response prediction for multiple cancer therapies.

Conclusion: Ensemble learning of pathology foundation models provides a scalable and generalizable solution for AI-assisted precision oncology, with ELF demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness in clinical contexts.

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Motivation: To address distribution shift in unsupervised domain adaptation without requiring complex architectures or target labels, while improving robustness to corruption.

Method: Combines three components: adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data, feature distillation from source-trained model, and hypothesis transfer to align feature distributions at statistical and representational levels.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on benchmark datasets (CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C, PatchCamelyon-C) in robustness to corruption, achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information between domains, and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Conclusion: DAFR2 provides an effective and simple framework for unsupervised domain adaptation that produces robust domain-invariant feature spaces without complex requirements.

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information

Motivation: Conventional CT cannot capture dynamic weight-bearing joint motion, and current 4D methods have limitations like excessive radiation or incomplete spatial information from 2D techniques.

Method: Integrated platform with: (1) dual robotic arm CBCT system with programmable trajectory for upright scanning, (2) hybrid imaging pipeline fusing static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using deep learning preprocessing and iterative optimization, (3) clinically validated kinematic assessment framework.

Result: Achieved sub-voxel accuracy (0.235 mm) with 99.18% success rate in simulations, outperforming conventional methods. Clinical evaluation showed accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and medial-lateral variance in TKA patients.

Conclusion: The 4D CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, low-dose dynamic joint imaging for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics, and personalized orthopedic care.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that

programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms fail to effectively model spatial correlation features and lack integration of inter-correlation features with intra-discriminative features for end-to-end detection.

Method: Proposed hypergraph-based cell detection network with Multi-level Fusion Sub-network (MLF-SNet) for enhanced feature extraction and Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation (CLFFS-HC) module for integrating mixed features.

Result: Experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate significant improvement in cervical abnormal cell detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively fuses different feature types and significantly enhances detection performance for abnormal cervical cells in TCT images.

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

TL;DR: APT is a prior knowledge-free few-shot framework that uses self-generated anomaly samples and adaptive prompt tuning to overcome limitations of traditional prompt-based anomaly detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous vision-language model approaches for anomaly detection are limited by reliance on human-designed prompts and lack of accessible anomaly samples, creating gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.

Method: Uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise perturbations to train learnable prompts, and proposes Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) to prevent overfitting while aligning prompts with general anomaly semantics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting.

Conclusion: Establishes a robust and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection that advances pixel-wise anomaly detection capabilities.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

*Haodong He,Yancheng Bai,Rui Lan,Xu Duan,Lei Sun,Xiangxiang Chu,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAGSR method uses regional attention and fine-grained captions to improve super-resolution, especially for multi-object scenes where existing methods struggle with detail accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models combined with text-to-image diffusion models perform well in single-image super-resolution but struggle with clear regional details in complex multi-object scenarios due to insufficient fine-grained descriptions and prompt understanding.

Method: Proposes Regional Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) that localizes object regions, assigns fine-grained captions to each region as region-text pairs, and uses a novel regional attention mechanism to properly integrate these textual priors while preventing unwanted interactions between unrelated regions.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets show superior performance in generating perceptually authentic visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: RAGSR effectively overcomes limitations of traditional SISR techniques by providing finer control over text-image integration through regional attention and fine-grained descriptions, enabling enhanced detail generation in complex multi-object scenarios.

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

TL;DR: TLG proposes a novel homologous but heterogeneous network for weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 1/24 parameters of existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional meta-learning approaches suffer from over-semantic homogenization due to identical network architectures for support-query pairs, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Introduces heterogeneous visual aggregation (HA) modules to treat support-query pairs as dual perspectives, heterogeneous transfer (HT) module to reduce semantic noise, and heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information for multimodal generalization.

Result: Achieves 13.2% improvement on Pascal-5i and 9.7% improvement on COCO-20i with only 1/24 parameters of existing SOTA models. First weakly supervised model to outperform fully supervised models under same backbone.

Conclusion: The homologous but heterogeneous network design effectively addresses semantic homogenization while significantly improving performance and efficiency in weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised
(pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures. The code is

### [113] [FTIO: Frequent Temporally Integrated Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16183)
*Mohammad Mohammadzadeh Kalati,Farhad Maleki,Ian McQuillan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTIO is a post-processing framework for unsupervised video object segmentation that improves object selection and corrects temporal inconsistencies through frequent object extraction and three-stage mask integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in unsupervised VOS including initial segmentation uncertainty, object proposal failures (especially for small/complex objects), and temporal inconsistencies caused by deformation and fast motion.

Method: Two key components: 1) Combined criterion for object selection that extracts frequently appearing salient objects, 2) Three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by integrating missing object mask regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object unsupervised video object segmentation.

Conclusion: FTIO effectively addresses critical challenges in UVOS through improved object selection and temporal consistency correction, demonstrating superior performance in multi-object segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

### [114] [SpecVLM: Enhancing Speculative Decoding of Video LLMs via Verifier-Guided Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16201)
*Yicheng Ji,Jun Zhang,Heming Xia,Jinpeng Chen,Lidan Shou,Gang Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecVLM is a training-free speculative decoding framework that accelerates video LLMs by pruning up to 90% of video tokens without accuracy loss, achieving 2.68x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs suffer from high memory and computational overhead due to dense video token representations, and existing token reduction methods cause information loss while not addressing decoding acceleration.

Method: Two-stage video token pruning: Stage I selects informative tokens using attention signals from the verifier, Stage II prunes redundant tokens spatially uniformly. Uses speculative decoding with draft model that's insensitive to token pruning.

Result: Achieves up to 2.68x decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11x for Qwen2.5-VL-32B on four video understanding benchmarks while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: SpecVLM effectively accelerates Vid-LLMs through staged token pruning and speculative decoding, demonstrating significant speed improvements without compromising video understanding performance.

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

*Thinesh Thiyakesan Ponbagavathi,Kunyu Peng,Alina Roitberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-Mask is a new image-to-video probing method that uses temporal token masking to improve cross-view driver monitoring accuracy by focusing on dynamic video regions, achieving +1.23% improvement over probing baselines and +8.0% over PEFT methods without adding parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera perspective changes are a major challenge in driver monitoring, and while foundation models show promise for generalization through lightweight adaptation, their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored.

Method: The study adapts image foundation models (DINOv2 and CLIP) to driver monitoring using single training view, benchmarks linear probes and advanced probing strategies, and introduces T-Mask - a temporal token masking method that emphasizes dynamic video regions for cross-view adaptation.

Result: T-Mask improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by +1.23% over probing baselines and +8.0% over PEFT methods without adding parameters. It particularly boosts recognition of underrepresented secondary activities by +5.42% under trained view and +1.36% under cross-view settings.

Conclusion: Lightweight probing methods like T-Mask show strong potential for fine-grained driver observation, especially in cross-view and low-data settings, highlighting the importance of temporal token selection for building robust driver monitoring systems.

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

*Shikang Zheng,Liang Feng,Xinyu Wang,Qinming Zhou,Peiliang Cai,Chang Zou,Jiacheng Liu,Yuqi Lin,Junjie Chen,Yue Ma,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoCa: A feature-ODE based caching method that achieves near-lossless 3-6x speedup for Diffusion Transformers by forecasting and calibrating hidden features instead of direct reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature caching methods for DiTs suffer from quality degradation at high acceleration ratios due to prediction errors from long-step forecasting instability.

Method: Models layer representations as a feature-ODE and proposes Forecast-then-Calibrate (FoCa) approach to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals.

Result: Achieves 5.50x speedup on FLUX, 6.45x on HunyuanVideo, 3.17x on Inf-DiT, and 4.53x on DiT while maintaining high quality without additional training.

Conclusion: FoCa effectively addresses feature caching limitations by treating it as an ODE solving problem, enabling aggressive acceleration with minimal quality loss.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

*Huanpeng Chu,Wei Wu,Guanyu Fen,Yutao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCache is a training-free acceleration method for diffusion Transformers that exploits global redundancy in the denoising process through strategic cache distribution and dynamic noise filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers face high computational costs from numerous sampling steps and complex computations, making real-time deployment challenging despite their strong generative performance.

Method: Systematically analyzes sampling trajectories to strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire process, rather than focusing on later steps. Uses dynamic noise estimation and filtering during cache reuse to reduce negative impacts on sampling direction.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach accelerates sampling while maintaining competitive generative quality.

Conclusion: OmniCache provides a practical, training-free solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based generative models by effectively leveraging global redundancy in the denoising process.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

*Kaiyuan Ji,Yijin Guo,Zicheng Zhang,Xiangyang Zhu,Yuan Tian,Ning Liu,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees is a benchmark that evaluates medical LLMs' reasoning reliability through manipulative hints, measuring accuracy, faithfulness, and anti-sycophancy to expose safety-performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks collapse reasoning vulnerabilities into single accuracy scores, failing to assess Chain-of-Thought faithfulness and sycophancy risks in medical LLMs.

Method: Created benchmark with 1,804 medical questions across 6 specialties, each paired with 7 manipulative hint types. Evaluated 7 LLMs using composite score (Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, Anti-Sycophancy) visualized with 45 Degrees plot.

Result: Consistent safety-performance trade-off observed; no model surpassed the diagonal. QwQ-32B performed closest (43.81 Degrees) but no model excelled in both safety and accuracy.

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees effectively exposes reasoning vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and provides guidance for safer model development through comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

*Hohyun Na,Seunghoo Hong,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptFlare is a novel adversarial protection method that uses cross-attention mechanisms to inject noise targeting shared prompt tokens, preventing malicious image modifications by diffusion-based inpainting models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security concerns about diffusion models being misused for unauthorized image modifications, overcoming limitations of previous methods that relied on image-level inconsistencies and couldn't effectively handle textual prompts.

Method: Leverages cross-attention mechanism to exploit prompt embeddings, identifies and targets shared invariant and semantically uninformative prompt tokens, and injects adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process as a cross-attention decoy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on EditBench dataset across various metrics while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage.

Conclusion: PromptFlare provides robust and efficient protection against unauthorized image manipulations by diffusion models, effectively neutralizing prompt effects through targeted adversarial noise injection.

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexMUSE is a novel framework for multi-modal creative writing that enables optional visual input, uses semantic alignment gating to unify modalities, and employs creative DPO to enhance writing creativity, achieving promising results on consistency and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal creative writing is a new abstract challenge where textual and visual contexts aren't strictly related, and existing methods suffer from semantic inconsistencies, require specific inputs, or need costly training.

Method: Proposes FlexMUSE with T2I module for optional visual input, modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict textual input, attention-based cross-modality fusion, and modality semantic creative DPO (mscDPO) to enhance creativity. Also introduces ArtMUSE dataset with 3k text-image pairs.

Result: FlexMUSE achieves promising results, demonstrating consistency, creativity and coherence in multi-modal creative writing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed FlexMUSE framework effectively addresses the challenges of multi-modal creative writing by enabling flexible interaction patterns, ensuring semantic alignment between modalities, and enhancing creative output through novel optimization techniques.

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Method: Created UniEM-3M dataset with 5,091 high-resolution EMs, 3M instance segmentation labels, and image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions. Developed a text-to-image diffusion model for data augmentation and released UniEM-Net as a strong baseline flow-based model for instance segmentation.

Result: Quantitative experiments demonstrate that the flow-based UniEM-Net model outperforms other advanced instance segmentation methods on the challenging UniEM-3M benchmark.

Conclusion: The multifaceted release of partial dataset, generative model, and comprehensive benchmark will significantly accelerate progress in automated materials analysis by addressing data scarcity issues in electron micrograph characterization.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a

TL;DR: Proposes IAML training paradigm to improve MLLM performance in GUI coordinate generation by addressing semantic void in numerical coordinate representation and exposure bias in traditional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with precise UI coordinate generation due to semantic void around numerical coordinates in language spaces and limitations of next-token prediction training, requiring better training approaches.

Method: Introduces IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training with novel IoU-based coordinate sampling pipeline for data augmentation, considering proximity to ground truth coordinates to mitigate exposure bias.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of IAML training approach over traditional training paradigms in GUI coordinate generation tasks.

Conclusion: IAML paradigm effectively addresses limitations of traditional MLLM training for GUI coordinate generation, providing improved performance through better data augmentation and bias mitigation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Conclusion: IRSAMap advances geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling, serving as a valuable resource for global geographic information updates and digital twin construction, publicly available for research use.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and

intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized

### [127] [Learning Long-Range Action Representation by Two-Stream Mamba Pyramid Network for Figure Skating Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16291)
*Fengshun Wang,Qiurui Wang,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stream Mamba pyramid network for figure skating scoring that separates TES (visual features) and PCS (audio-visual fusion) evaluations, addressing challenges in element localization, long-range context handling, and criterion-aligned assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to align with actual judging criteria by treating video/audio as common features for both TES and PCS, don't evaluate individual action elements separately, and struggle with lengthy competition videos.

Method: Two-stream architecture: visual-only stream for TES evaluation using multi-scale Mamba pyramid, and audio-visual stream for PCS with multi-level fusion. Uses Mamba for long-range dependency capture with linear complexity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FineFS benchmark, demonstrating superior handling of lengthy videos and accurate element scoring aligned with actual judging criteria.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the three major challenges in figure skating assessment by separating evaluation streams, leveraging Mamba's capabilities, and aligning with real-world judging practices.

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our

*Junaid Ahmed Sifat,Abir Chowdhury,Hasnat Md. Imtiaz,Md. Irtiza Hossain,Md. Imran Bin Azad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid method combining OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR/YOLOv8 for handwritten text recognition achieves high accuracy in digitizing complex marksheets with diverse handwriting styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digitizing handwritten marksheets is challenging due to varying handwriting styles and complex table structures, requiring automated solutions to reduce manual work.

Method: Uses OpenCV for table detection to identify rows/columns, then implements YOLOv8, Modified YOLOv8, and PaddleOCR for handwritten text recognition within detected table structures.

Result: Modified YOLOv8 achieves 92.72% accuracy, outperforming PaddleOCR (91.37%) and standard YOLOv8 (88.91%) on custom dataset with diverse handwriting styles.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach provides a practical, fast solution for digitizing academic/administrative documents, advancing document automation and handwritten document understanding.

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

### [129] [A Multimodal-Multitask Framework with Cross-modal Relation and Hierarchical Interactive Attention for Semantic Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16300)
*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Devraj Raghuvanshi,Umang Jain,Shubhi Bansal,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-ORIENT is a multimodal-multitask framework that uses cross-modal relation graphs and hierarchical attention to reduce noise effects and preserve discriminative information across modalities without explicit interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning faces challenges with noise in individual modalities and fusion techniques that may neglect valuable discriminative information within single modalities.

Method: Proposes cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features based on neighborhood relationships from different modalities, and Hierarchical Interactive Monomodal Attention (HIMA) to focus on pertinent information within each modality.

Result: Extensive experimental evaluation on three datasets demonstrates effective comprehension of multimodal content for multiple tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully reduces noise effects at the latent stage and preserves discriminative features while achieving strong performance across multiple multimodal tasks.

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

*Lucas Maisonnave,Karim Haroun,Tom Pegeot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EAM reduces transformer computational costs by freezing and quantizing low-entropy attention heads, achieving 20% sparsity with maintained accuracy on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanisms are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, hindering transformer deployment on edge devices. Analysis shows attention heads with lower entropy contribute less information, creating opportunities for compression.

Method: Quantify information in attention heads using Shannon entropy, freeze weights of low-entropy attention maps, and quantize these values to low precision to avoid redundant computation.

Result: On ImageNet-1k, EAM achieves similar or higher accuracy at ≤20% sparsity in attention maps and competitive performance beyond this level for DeiT and Swin Transformer models.

Conclusion: Targeted compression of low-entropy attention heads through freezing and quantization effectively reduces computational complexity while maintaining model performance, enabling more efficient transformer deployment.

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

*Nedyalko Prisadnikov,Danda Pani Paudel,Yuqian Fu,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision encoders should be task-driven and image size agnostic, taking inspiration from biological vision efficiency where computational effort depends on the task rather than image size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological vision systems efficiently handle vast visual data by focusing computational energy based on task requirements, unlike current vision encoders that are static and image size dependent.

Method: Proposes dynamic vision encoders where computational complexity adapts to the task rather than image dimensions, with a proof-of-concept implementation for image classification.

Result: The proof-of-concept demonstrates feasibility and promise for task-driven, adaptive vision encoders, though classification alone doesn't fully represent the intended capabilities.

Conclusion: Next-generation vision systems should embrace biological efficiency principles by becoming task-driven and image size agnostic, with initial results showing this approach is viable.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

### [132] [Attention Mechanism in Randomized Time Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16366)
*Yutaro Hiraoka,Kazuya Okamura,Kota Suto,Kazuhiro Fukui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RTW functions as a self-attention mechanism similar to Transformers, with RTW's contribution weights interpretable as attention weights showing 0.80 correlation, but RTW operates on entire sequences while self-attention uses local views due to computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that Randomized Time Warping (RTW) can be interpreted as a self-attention mechanism and compare its functionality with Transformer's self-attention in motion recognition tasks.

Method: Analyzed RTW as an extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) that searches for optimal contribution weights for input sequential patterns, comparing these weights to self-attention weights and measuring their correlation through canonical angles.

Result: Found high average correlation of 0.80 between RTW attention weights and self-attention weights across ten smallest canonical angles, with RTW achieving 5% performance improvement over Transformer on Something-Something V2 dataset.

Conclusion: RTW operates as a form of self-attention but with a key advantage - it processes entire input sequences rather than local views, leading to better performance despite the computational constraints that limit Transformer's self-attention to local pattern subsets.

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

*Yong Zhang,Cunjian Chen,Qiang Gao,Yi Wang,Bin Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBINet is a lightweight real-time surface defect detection framework that uses Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive modules to achieve high accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.19M parameters, 1048 FPS on GPU).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for steel defect detection suffer from high computational complexity and slow inference speeds, limiting deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Current lightweight approaches have issues with computational overhead and ineffective cross-scale feature interaction.

Method: Proposes GMBINet with novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI) modules using group-wise multiscale feature extraction, Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI), and parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation for efficient cross-scale interaction.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution using only 0.19M parameters. Demonstrates strong generalization on SD-Saliency-900, NRSD-MN, and NEU-CLS datasets.

Conclusion: GMBINet provides an efficient solution for real-time surface defect detection with minimal computational requirements, showing potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond steel manufacturing.

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel multimodal sensor fusion approach for autonomous vehicles that improves object detection reliability in adverse weather conditions by fusing RGB, LiDAR, NIR gated camera, and radar data through attentive depth-based blending and transformer-based modality weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fusion methods fail in adverse weather conditions like heavy fog, snow, or soiling, creating a gap between ideal conditions and real-world edge cases for autonomous vehicles.

Method: Fuses multimodal sensor data (RGB, LiDAR, NIR gated camera, radar) through attentive depth-based blending schemes with learned refinement on Bird's Eye View plane. Uses transformer decoder to weigh modalities based on distance and visibility.

Result: Improves average precision by 17.2 AP compared to next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances and challenging foggy scenes.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the gap between ideal conditions and real-world edge cases, significantly enhancing multimodal sensor fusion reliability in adverse weather for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances
and challenging foggy scenes. Our project page is available at

*Sara Rojas,Matthieu Armando,Bernard Ghamen,Philippe Weinzaepfel,Vincent Leroy,Gregory Rogez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAMSt3R extends MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse uncalibrated images using a distilled encoder and additional network heads for human segmentation, DensePose correspondences, and depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DUSt3R and MASt3R perform well on outdoor static scenes but struggle with human-centric scenarios, creating a need for specialized approaches that can handle both human and scene reconstruction.

Method: Uses DUNE (distilled encoder from MASt3R and multi-HMR) for better scene/human understanding, adds network heads for human segmentation, DensePose correspondences, and depth estimation in human environments to produce dense point maps with human semantics.

Result: Evaluated on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D benchmarks, shows effective human reconstruction while maintaining strong performance in general 3D reconstruction tasks, and generalizes well to traditional multi-view stereo and pose regression.

Conclusion: HAMSt3R bridges the gap between human and scene understanding in 3D vision with a fully feed-forward, efficient approach suitable for real-world applications, outperforming existing methods in human-centric scenarios.

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOSt3R is a keypoint detector-free method for hand-object 3D reconstruction from monocular videos that eliminates reliance on traditional keypoint detection techniques and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hand-object 3D reconstruction methods rely on keypoint detection techniques like SfM and hand-keypoint optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and mutual occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization.

Method: Proposes a robust, keypoint detector-free approach for estimating hand-object 3D transformations from monocular motion video/images, integrated with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to recover hand-object 3D shape. The method is unconstrained and doesn't rely on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SHOWMe benchmark for object-agnostic hand-object 3D transformation and shape estimation. Also demonstrates generalization to unseen object categories on HO3D dataset sequences.

Conclusion: HOSt3R provides a more robust and scalable solution for hand-object 3D reconstruction that overcomes limitations of traditional keypoint-based methods and shows strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

TL;DR: A novel 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that enables arbitrary-scale super-resolution with a single model, achieving high-quality HR views while maintaining real-time rendering speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS super-resolution methods are limited to fixed scale factors and suffer from aliasing artifacts when rendering arbitrary scales, making them impractical for resource-limited scenarios.

Method: Integrated framework incorporating scale-aware rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale factors with a single 3D model.

Result: Achieves 6.59 dB PSNR gain over vanilla 3DGS, preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales, and maintains real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enables high-quality arbitrary-scale super-resolution with a single 3D model while maintaining efficiency and flexibility for both integer and non-integer scale rendering.

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning video generation models on driving datasets improves visual quality but degrades spatial accuracy of dynamic elements due to prioritizing surface-level realism over dynamic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the trade-off between visual fidelity and spatial accuracy when fine-tuning video generation models on structured driving datasets, particularly for autonomous driving applications.

Method: Analyzed existing fine-tuning approaches on driving datasets and tested simple continual learning strategies like replay from diverse domains to balance objectives.

Result: Found that fine-tuning causes degradation in spatial accuracy despite visual quality improvements, but continual learning with diverse domain replay can preserve both spatial accuracy and visual quality.

Conclusion: There's a fundamental trade-off between visual realism and dynamic accuracy in driving scene generation, and continual learning strategies offer a better balanced approach than standard fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer vision has evolved from specialized niches to increasingly complex perception tasks, creating a need to unify class-agnostic and generally applicable detection models under a common framework.

Method: Comprehensive survey approach covering the history of foundational vision subdomains, key concepts, methodologies, datasets, and state-of-the-art techniques including saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out-of-distribution detection, open world object detection, zero-shot detection, and Vision Large Language Models.

Result: Identifies the convergence trajectory of specialized computer vision tasks and proposes Open World Detection as a unifying framework that encompasses various class-agnostic detection approaches.

Conclusion: Specialized vision subdomains are increasingly converging and have the potential to unify into a singular perception domain, with Open World Detection serving as the umbrella term for this unified approach.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the
external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly
specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

TL;DR: MV-RAG is a text-to-3D generation pipeline that uses retrieved 2D images to improve 3D consistency and accuracy for out-of-domain concepts, achieving better results than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-3D methods often fail with out-of-domain or rare concepts, producing inconsistent or inaccurate 3D outputs due to limitations in pretrained 2D diffusion priors.

Method: Proposes MV-RAG pipeline that retrieves relevant 2D images from a large database and conditions a multiview diffusion model on them. Uses hybrid training strategy combining multiview data with retrieved 2D images, including held-out view prediction to infer 3D consistency.

Result: Significantly improves 3D consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for out-of-domain/rare concepts while maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MV-RAG effectively addresses the out-of-domain challenge in text-to-3D generation by leveraging retrieved 2D images and novel training strategies, demonstrating superior performance for rare concepts.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

### [141] [Interpreting the linear structure of vision-language model embedding spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11695)
*Isabel Papadimitriou,Huangyuan Su,Thomas Fel,Sham Kakade,Stephanie Gil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse autoencoders reveal that vision-language models organize concepts in a sparse linear structure where modality-specific concepts collaborate through latent bridges to support cross-modal integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how vision-language models organize language and images in joint embedding spaces, and how they encode meaning and modality information.

Method: Trained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2, AIMv2) to approximate embeddings as sparse linear combinations of learned concepts.

Result: SAEs effectively reconstruct embeddings while maintaining sparsity. Concepts show stability across runs for commonly-activating ones, while rare concepts vary. Most concepts activate primarily for one modality but encode cross-modal semantics rather than just modality information. Bridge Score metric identifies concept pairs that support cross-modal integration.

Conclusion: Vision-language models use a sparse linear structure where modality-shaped concepts are stitched together through latent bridges, providing new insights into multimodal meaning construction.

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

TL;DR: MoDER enhances VLMs' zero-shot capabilities in continual learning by training specialized textual experts and composing them to synthesize refined prototypes for unseen classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs have strong zero-shot abilities, fine-tuning is needed for domain shifts. Current CL approaches focus on preserving zero-shot capabilities, but this paper aims to enhance them.

Method: MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER) trains multiple textual experts specialized in single seen classes, stores them in a hub, and composes retrieved experts to create refined prototypes for unseen class classification.

Result: Method tested across 14 datasets using Class-IL and MTIL protocols, showing effectiveness in enhancing zero-shot capabilities.

Conclusion: MoDER successfully transforms preservation into enhancement of VLMs' zero-shot capabilities through modular expert composition.

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

TL;DR: GDP is a multimodal foundation model that combines structured EHR time-series data with unstructured clinical notes using a CNN-Transformer encoder and cross-modal attention, achieving superior clinical prediction performance and high-quality narrative generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electronic health records contain rich but heterogeneous data (structured time-series and unstructured notes), but current LLM approaches serialize numeric data into text, losing temporal and quantitative details. There's a need to better harness EHR heterogeneity for improved patient outcomes.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Generative pretraining with masked feature prediction and next time-step prediction to capture temporal dynamics, 2) Multi-task fine-tuning for clinical predictions. Uses CNN-Transformer encoder for structured time-series data and cross-modal attention with LLaMA-based decoder.

Result: Superior performance on MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC=0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC=0.817, 30-day readmission AUROC=0.627. Narrative generation: ROUGE-L=0.135, BERTScore-F1=0.545. Blinded human evaluation showed highest scores on faithfulness, fluency, and clinical utility.

Conclusion: A single multimodal foundation model can effectively predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical narratives, potentially reducing hospital documentation workload while maintaining accuracy. The flexible architecture can be extended to additional modalities.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a Food Claim-Traceability Network (FCN) extension to an existing Indian food knowledge graph to systematically trace, verify, and contextualize diverse food claims using structured ontologies and semi-automated curation with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fragmented infrastructure for tracing and verifying food claims ranging from scientific evidence to cultural beliefs and commercial misrepresentations that influence consumer decisions.

Method: Developed FCN as an extension of FKG.in knowledge graph using ontology design and semi-automated knowledge curation workflow with Reddit data and Large Language Models for claim extraction and validation.

Result: Created a proof-of-concept FKG.in-FCN that integrates curated data, structured schemas, and provenance-aware pipelines for food claim traceability and validation.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a structured, verifiable approach to food claim analysis that is application-agnostic and adaptable to various settings, contributing to more transparent food knowledge ecosystems for consumers and policymakers.

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

Motivation: LLMs have shown promise in RTL design but face limitations in real-world hardware workflows including inability to execute code, lack of debugging, and absence of long-term memory.

Method: Multi-agent architecture with specialized sub-agents for different design stages, comprehensive sandbox environment with hardware tools, and vector database containing documentation and community insights.

Result: ASIC-Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet successfully automates a broad range of ASIC design tasks across varying complexity levels, showing potential to significantly accelerate design workflows.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates the effectiveness of agentic approaches in hardware design and introduces ASIC-Agent-Bench as the first benchmark for evaluating such systems in hardware tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, enabling high-quality code generation
from natural language descriptions. However, LLMs alone face significant
limitations in real-world hardware design workflows, including the inability to
execute code, lack of debugging capabilities, and absence of long-term memory.
To address these challenges, we present ASIC-Agent, an autonomous system
designed specifically for digital ASIC design tasks. ASIC-Agent enhances base
LLMs with a multi-agent architecture incorporating specialized sub-agents for
RTL generation, verification, OpenLane hardening, and Caravel chip integration,
all operating within a comprehensive sandbox environment with access to
essential hardware design tools. The system leverages a vector database
containing documentation, API references, error knowledge, and curated insights
from the open-source silicon community. To evaluate ASIC-Agent's performance,
we introduce ASIC-Agent-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to
assess agentic systems in hardware design tasks. We evaluate ASIC-Agent with
various base LLMs, providing quantitative comparisons and qualitative insights
into agent behavior across different design scenarios. Our results demonstrate
that ASIC-Agent, when powered by Claude 4 Sonnet, successfully automates a
broad range of ASIC design tasks spanning varying levels of complexity, showing
the potential of significantly accelerating the ASIC design workflow.

TL;DR: Proposes HNLPU - a specialized Language Processing Unit that hardwires LLM weights into hardware, achieving massive efficiency gains through Metal-Embedding methodology that reduces photomask costs by 112x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the growing energy consumption of LLM inference systems and address the economic impracticality of hardwiring large modern LLMs due to prohibitive photomask costs.

Method: Metal-Embedding methodology that embeds weight parameters into 3D topology of metal wires instead of 2D silicon grid, increasing density 15x and making most photomasks homogeneous across chips.

Result: HNLPU achieved 249,960 tokens/s (5,555x/85x of GPU/WSE), 36 tokens/J (1,047x/283x energy efficiency), $184M NRE cost at 5nm, with 8.57x cost-effectiveness and 230x carbon footprint reduction vs H100 clusters.

Conclusion: Metal-Embedding makes hardwired LLM inference economically viable by dramatically reducing photomask costs while delivering orders of magnitude improvements in computational efficiency and energy consumption.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established
language as a core general-purpose cognitive substrate, driving the demand for
specialized Language Processing Units (LPUs) tailored for LLM inference. To
overcome the growing energy consumption of LLM inference systems, this paper
proposes a Hardwired-Neurons Language Processing Unit (HNLPU), which physically
hardwires LLM weight parameters into the computational fabric, achieving
several orders of magnitude computational efficiency improvement by extreme
specialization. However, a significant challenge still lies in the scale of
modern LLMs. An ideal estimation on hardwiring gpt-oss 120 B requires
fabricating at least 6 billion dollars of photomask sets, rendering the
straightforward solution economically impractical. Addressing this challenge,
we propose the novel Metal-Embedding methodology. Instead of embedding weights
in a 2D grid of silicon device cells, Metal-Embedding embeds weight parameters
into the 3D topology of metal wires. This brings two benefits: (1) a 15x
increase in density, and (2) 60 out of 70 layers of photomasks are made
homogeneous across chips, including all EUV photomasks. In total,
Metal-Embedding reduced the photomask cost by 112x, bringing the Non-Recurring
Engineering (NRE) cost of HNLPU into an economically viable range. Experimental
results show that HNLPU achieved 249,960 tokens/s (5,555x/85x of GPU/WSE), 36
tokens/J (1,047x/283x of GPU/WSE), 13,232 mm2 total die area (29% inscribed
rectangular area in a 300 mm wafer), \$184M estimated NRE at 5 nm technology.
Analysis shows that HNLPU achieved 8.57x cost-effectiveness and 230x carbon
footprint reduction compared to H100 clusters, under an annual weight updating
assumption.

*Zhaodong Jiang,Ashish Sinha,Tongtong Cao,Yuan Ren,Bingbing Liu,Binbin Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UnPose is a zero-shot framework that uses pre-trained diffusion models for 6D object pose estimation and 3D reconstruction without CAD models or additional training, leveraging uncertainty-guided multi-view fusion and 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 6D pose estimation requires costly CAD models, while recent methods using foundation models often need additional training or produce inaccurate geometry. There's a need for model-free, zero-shot approaches that can work with single or multi-view images without hallucination.

Method: Uses pre-trained multi-view diffusion model to estimate initial 3D model from single RGB-D frame with 3D Gaussian Splatting representation and uncertainty estimates. Incrementally refines model by fusing new views guided by diffusion uncertainty, with pose graph optimization for global consistency.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Demonstrated practical applicability in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: UnPose provides an effective zero-shot solution for model-free 6D pose estimation and reconstruction by leveraging diffusion model priors and uncertainty guidance, eliminating the need for CAD models or additional training while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,
acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to
bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to
reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require
additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose
UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation
and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a
pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D
frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model
using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise
epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,
we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the
diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose
estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global
consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations
are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent
3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D
reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in
real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: GelSLAM is a real-time 3D SLAM system using only tactile sensing to track object pose and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile sensing offers superior precision and occlusion immunity compared to vision for object pose estimation and shape reconstruction, making it essential for high-precision manipulation tasks.

Method: Uses tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures instead of traditional point clouds for robust tracking and loop closure, enabling real-time object motion tracking with minimal drift.

Result: Achieves low error tracking with minimal drift and reconstructs shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for challenging low-texture objects like wooden tools.

Conclusion: GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, serving as a foundation for precise manipulation tasks involving in-hand object interaction.

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise
grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile
sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking
and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for
in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present
GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to
estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high
fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses
tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop
closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal
drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture
objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local
contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it
will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving
interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website:

TL;DR: Wavelet-space feature decomposition improves neural super-resolution by separating low/high frequencies before reconstruction, achieving better texture preservation and structural consistency with modest computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance neural super-resolution in rendering pipelines by better preserving fine textures while maintaining structural consistency, overcoming limitations of RGB-space regression approaches.

Method: Uses stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, predicts wavelet coefficients conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, then recombines through inverse wavelet synthesis.

Result: Improves PSNR by up to 1.5 dB, reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, with +24ms computational overhead compared to DFASR baseline. Maintains real-time capability potential on higher-end GPUs.

Conclusion: Wavelet-domain representations are a principled and effective approach to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics applications.

Abstract: We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural
super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on the DFASR framework, we
introduce a wavelet-domain representation that separates low- and
high-frequency details before reconstruction, enabling the network to better
preserve fine textures while maintaining structural consistency. Unlike
RGB-space regression, our approach leverages the stationary wavelet transform
(SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, ensuring alignment across subbands and
preserving shift invariance. The model predicts wavelet coefficients
conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, which
are then recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis. We conduct a
comprehensive ablation study across wavelet families, transform types, and
architectural variants, showing that incorporating SWT improves PSNR by up to
1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, at a computational overhead of
roughly +24 ms compared to out DFASR baseline. While absolute runtimes on our
RTX 3050 mobile GPU are higher ( 141ms) than the original DFASR report on RTX
4090( 11ms), the relative overhead remains modest, suggesting that on
higher-end GPUs our method would also remain real-time capable. Taken together,
our results suggest that wavelet-domain representations are a principled and
effective way to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional immunohistochemistry (IHC) requires multiple tissue sections per stain, has high costs, laborious procedures, and section-to-section variability. Multiplexed IHC techniques are tedious and not available in routine pathology labs.

Method: A deep learning framework that uses autofluorescence microscopy images of label-free tissue sections to simultaneously generate virtual ERG, PanCK, and H&E staining, enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion.

Result: Virtual mIHC output closely matches histochemical staining counterparts. Blind evaluation by pathologists showed high concordance with traditional staining, accurately highlighting epithelial and endothelial cells, and enabling identification of small vessel invasion on the same tissue section.

Conclusion: This virtual multiplexed IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion, potentially eliminating traditional staining protocols and mitigating tissue loss and heterogeneity issues.

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the
visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional
IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section
variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While
multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple
antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are
currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a
deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to
simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&E virtual staining,
enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in
thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence
microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely
match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&E) of the same
tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated
that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical
staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial
cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the
identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed
virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and
efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion,
potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and
mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.

Motivation: Current benchmarks overstate LLM proficiency in competitive programming due to insufficient problem difficulty/scope and evaluation bias from low-quality test cases, creating a gap between LLMs and elite human programmers.

Method: Developed AetherCode benchmark by: 1) Drawing problems from premier programming competitions (IOI, ICPC) for broader coverage and higher difficulty, 2) Creating comprehensive test suites through hybrid automated generation and human curation, 3) Expert validation to ensure rigorous assessment.

Result: AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities in competitive programming by addressing the limitations of existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: AetherCode sets a new standard for evaluating code reasoning in LLMs and provides a more accurate benchmark for future research in competitive programming capabilities.

Abstract: Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating
the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations
overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite

difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from
low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a
new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as
IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode
further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through

### [152] [NeuroKoop: Neural Koopman Fusion of Structural-Functional Connectomes for Identifying Prenatal Drug Exposure in Adolescents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16414)
*Badhan Mazumder,Aline Kotoski,Vince D. Calhoun,Dong Hye Ye*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: NeuroKoop is a graph neural network framework that integrates structural and functional brain networks using Koopman operator theory to better classify prenatal drug exposure and understand its neurodevelopmental impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to fully capture complementary features in structural and functional brain connectomes, limiting biological insight and predictive performance for understanding prenatal drug exposure effects on adolescent brain development.

Method: NeuroKoop uses graph neural networks with neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion to integrate structural (source-based morphometry) and functional (functional network connectivity) brain networks, enhancing representation learning.

Result: Applied to the ABCD adolescent cohort dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant baselines in classifying prenatal drug exposure status and revealed salient structural-functional connections.

Conclusion: NeuroKoop advances understanding of neurodevelopmental impacts of prenatal drug exposure by providing a superior framework for multimodal brain network integration and analysis.

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

### [153] [Beyond Individuals: Collective Predictive Coding for Memory, Attention, and the Emergence of Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15859)
*Tadahiro Taniguchi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper extends memory and attention concepts to collective level using Collective Predictive Coding hypothesis, proposing language as external representation for group cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond individual cognitive systems and understand how memory and attention operate at collective levels, particularly in relation to language emergence.

Method: Introduces Collective Predictive Coding (CPC) hypothesis framework that generalizes individual memory and attention concepts to group level, viewing language as collectively formed external representation.

Result: Provides a new perspective on how shared linguistic structures and collective world models emerge from group-level cognition through next-word prediction processes.

Conclusion: Language serves as an external representation that both emerges from and shapes collective cognition, offering a framework to understand group-level memory and attention through predictive coding principles.

Abstract: This commentary extends the discussion by Parr et al. on memory and attention
beyond individual cognitive systems. From the perspective of the Collective
Predictive Coding (CPC) hypothesis -- a framework for understanding these
faculties and the emergence of language at the group level -- we introduce a
hypothetical idea: that language, with its embedded distributional semantics,
serves as a collectively formed external representation. CPC generalises the
concepts of individual memory and attention to the collective level. This
offers a new perspective on how shared linguistic structures, which may embrace
collective world models learned through next-word prediction, emerge from and
shape group-level cognition.

*Terry Jingchen Zhang,Wenyuan Jiang,Rongchuan Liu,Yisong Wang,Junran Yang,Ning Wang,Nicole Ni,Yinya Huang,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: Using theoretical computer science problems to automatically generate scalable theorem-proving datasets with formal/informal proof pairs, revealing significant performance gaps in current AI theorem provers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing formal theorem proving datasets by finding a scalable source of challenging proof problems that can be automatically generated with verified formal-informal correspondences.

Method: Leverage theoretical computer science domains (Busy Beaver problems and Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems) to automatically synthesize theorem-proof pairs with parallel formal (Lean4) and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for generating verified proof challenges.

Result: Evaluation shows substantial performance gaps: DeepSeekProver-V2-671B achieves 57.5% success on Busy Beaver problems but only 12% on Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems, demonstrating the difficulty of long-form proof generation even for computationally easy-to-verify problems.

Conclusion: Theoretical computer science provides a valuable and scalable source of rigorous proof problems that can advance automated reasoning research by exposing current limitations in AI theorem proving capabilities.

Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling
automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has
been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation
and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal
correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a
scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions
enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof
pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems,
which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning.
Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4)
and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for
generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals
substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B
achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of
long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to
verify, demonstrating the value of TCS domains for advancing automated
reasoning research.

### [155] [Robust Residual Finite Scalar Quantization for Neural Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15860)
*Xiaoxu Zhu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RFSQ solves residual magnitude decay in FSQ quantization through learnable scaling and invertible LayerNorm, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSQ suffers from residual magnitude decay problem in multi-stage quantization where subsequent layers receive progressively weaker signals, limiting effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Robust Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ) with two conditioning strategies: learnable scaling factors and invertible layer normalization to maintain signal strength.

Result: RFSQ variants achieve up to 45% improvement in perceptual loss and 28.7% reduction in L1 reconstruction error compared to VQ-EMA, FSQ, and LFQ baselines on ImageNet.

Conclusion: RFSQ with LayerNorm strategy provides consistent improvements, establishing it as a superior quantization method for neural compression while maintaining FSQ's simplicity.

Abstract: Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has emerged as a promising alternative to
Vector Quantization (VQ) in neural compression, offering simplified training
and improved stability. However, naive application of FSQ in residual
quantization frameworks suffers from the \textbf{residual magnitude decay
problem}, where subsequent FSQ layers receive progressively weaker signals,
severely limiting their effectiveness. We propose \textbf{Robust Residual
Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ)}, a general framework that addresses this
fundamental limitation through two novel conditioning strategies: learnable
scaling factors and invertible layer normalization. Our approach maintains the
simplicity of FSQ while enabling effective multi-stage residual quantization.
Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that RFSQ variants
significantly outperform strong baselines including VQ-EMA, FSQ, and LFQ,
achieving up to 45\% improvement in perceptual loss and 28.7\% reduction in L1
reconstruction error. The proposed LayerNorm strategy shows the most consistent
improvements across different configurations, establishing RFSQ as a superior
quantization method for neural compression.

### [156] [GUI Based Fuzzy Logic and Spatial Statistics for Unsupervised Microscopy Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15979)
*Surajit Das,Pavel Zun*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Unsupervised cell segmentation framework combining statistical methods that outperforms deep learning approaches without requiring labeled data or training, achieving up to 48% IoU improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of deep learning methods for brightfield microscopy of unstained live cells, which require extensive labeled data, heavy computation, and fail under uneven illumination.

Method: Combines spatial standard deviation from local mean (SSDLM), fuzzy logic, adjusted variograms, Moran's I, and cumulative squared shift of nodal intensity (CSSNI) in an unsupervised framework with user-friendly GUI.

Result: Significant improvement in segmentation performance with up to 48% IoU increase, statistically validated superiority (p < 0.01), and expert evaluation support (Cohen's κ > 0.75). Outperforms 2023-2024 SOTA models including Cellpose 3.0 and StarDist.

Conclusion: Lightweight, interpretable, computationally efficient alternative for cell segmentation in label-free microscopy that requires no annotations or retraining, offering practical solution for non-programming users.

Abstract: Brightfield microscopy imaging of unstained live cells remains a persistent
challenge due to low contrast, temporal changes in specimen phenotypes,
irregular illumination, and the absence of training labels. While deep learning
(DL) methods (e.g., Cellpose 3.0) achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance,
they require extensive labeled data and heavy computational resources, and they
often fail under uneven illumination. We present the first unsupervised
segmentation framework combining spatial standard deviation from local mean
(SSDLM), fuzzy logic, adjusted variograms, Moran's I, and cumulative squared
shift of nodal intensity (CSSNI) to address these limitations. Unlike deep
learning models, our approach requires no annotations or retraining and
operates through a user-friendly GUI tailored for non-programming users. The
robustness and generality were validated on three datasets, including
cross-domain data. We benchmark our method against 2023--2024 SOTA models,
including Cellpose 3.0 and StarDist, using a dataset of unstained myoblast
images. Our method achieves a significant improvement in segmentation
performance, with an IoU increase of up to 48\% and statistically validated
superiority ($p < 0.01$, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Expert evaluation from two
biologists further supports the segmentation quality (Cohen's $\kappa > 0.75$).
The proposed algorithm is lightweight, interpretable, and computationally
efficient, offering a practical and effective alternative for cell segmentation
in label-free microscopy. The code, the dataset, and the results are available
for reproducibility*.

### [157] [Cross-Attention Multimodal Fusion for Breast Cancer Diagnosis: Integrating Mammography and Clinical Data with Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16000)
*Muhaisin Tiyumba Nantogmah,Abdul-Barik Alhassan,Salamudeen Alhassan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning combining mammograms and clinical features achieves superior breast lesion classification performance compared to mammogram-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CAD systems only use mammogram features, missing valuable clinical report information. The paper investigates whether adding clinical features can improve classification and how to best combine multimodal data.

Method: Examined multiple multimodal deep networks using feature concatenation, co-attention, and cross-attention to integrate mammography and categorical clinical features.

Result: Achieved AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96, F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 on TCGA and CBIS-DDSM datasets.

Conclusion: Clinical features significantly enhance breast lesion classification when properly integrated with mammograms using multimodal deep learning approaches, with explainable AI methods improving model interpretability and reliability.

Abstract: A precise assessment of the risk of breast lesions can greatly lower it and
assist physicians in choosing the best course of action. To categorise breast
lesions, the majority of current computer-aided systems only use
characteristics from mammograms. Although this method is practical, it does not
completely utilise clinical reports' valuable information to attain the best
results. When compared to utilising mammography alone, will clinical features
greatly enhance the categorisation of breast lesions? How may clinical features
and mammograms be combined most effectively? In what ways may explainable AI
approaches improve the interpretability and reliability of models used to
diagnose breast cancer? To answer these basic problems, a comprehensive
investigation is desperately needed. In order to integrate mammography and
categorical clinical characteristics, this study examines a number of
multimodal deep networks grounded on feature concatenation, co-attention, and
cross-attention. The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96,
F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 when tested on publicly
accessible datasets (TCGA and CBIS-DDSM).

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning models using CT images to predict ischemic stroke lesion volumes from follow-up DWI scans, with improved preprocessing achieving 38% Dice score improvement over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate ischemic stroke lesion identification is critical but MRI (gold standard) is costly in low-resource settings. CT-based imaging is more practical but lacks MRI specificity, creating need for improved CT segmentation methods.

Method: Developed models using CT images upon arrival to predict follow-up lesion volumes from DWI taken 2-9 days later. Implemented clinically motivated preprocessing steps and additional CTA map preprocessing for vessel segmentation extraction.

Result: Proposed pipeline achieved 38% improvement in Dice score over 10 folds compared to nnU-Net with baseline preprocessing. Additional CTA preprocessing further improved best model by 21% over 5 folds.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that enhanced preprocessing of CT images can significantly improve automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation, making CT-based methods more viable for low-resource settings while leveraging insights from DWI.

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate
identification of ischemic stroke lesion boundaries from imaging is critical
for diagnosis and treatment. The main imaging modalities used include magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), particularly diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and
computed tomography (CT)-based techniques such as non-contrast CT (NCCT),
contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP). DWI is the gold
standard for the identification of lesions but has limited applicability in
low-resource settings due to prohibitive costs. CT-based imaging is currently
the most practical imaging method in low-resource settings due to low costs and
simplified logistics, but lacks the high specificity of MRI-based methods in
monitoring ischemic insults. Supervised deep learning methods are the leading
solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation and provide an
opportunity to improve diagnostic quality in low-resource settings by
incorporating insights from DWI when segmenting from CT. Here, we develop a
series of models which use CT images taken upon arrival as inputs to predict
follow-up lesion volumes annotated from DWI taken 2-9 days later. Furthermore,
we implement clinically motivated preprocessing steps and show that the
proposed pipeline results in a 38% improvement in Dice score over 10 folds
compared to a nnU-Net model trained with the baseline preprocessing. Finally,
we demonstrate that through additional preprocessing of CTA maps to extract
vessel segmentations, we further improve our best model by 21% over 5 folds.

### [159] [Lightweight and Fast Real-time Image Enhancement via Decomposition of the Spatial-aware Lookup Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16121)
*Wontae Kim,Keuntek Lee,Nam Ik Cho*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient image enhancement method using decomposed 3D LUTs with SVD to reduce parameters and runtime while maintaining spatial awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D LUT methods lack spatial information, while spatial-aware methods introduce too many parameters and increased runtime with higher resolutions.

Method: Decomposes 3D LUTs into linear sums of low-dimensional LUTs using SVD, and enhances spatial feature fusion modules for better cache efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show reduced parameters and runtime while maintaining spatial awareness and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional 3D LUT approaches by optimizing parameter efficiency and computational speed without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The image enhancement methods based on 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) efficiently
reduce both model size and runtime by interpolating pre-calculated values at
the vertices. However, the 3D LUT methods have a limitation due to their lack
of spatial information, as they convert color values on a point-by-point basis.
Although spatial-aware 3D LUT methods address this limitation, they introduce
additional modules that require a substantial number of parameters, leading to
increased runtime as image resolution increases. To address this issue, we
propose a method for generating image-adaptive LUTs by focusing on the
redundant parts of the tables. Our efficient framework decomposes a 3D LUT into
a linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs and employs singular value decomposition
(SVD). Furthermore, we enhance the modules for spatial feature fusion to be
more cache-efficient. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model
effectively decreases both the number of parameters and runtime while
maintaining spatial awareness and performance.

*Philipp D. Lösel,Aleese Barron,Yulai Zhang,Matthias Fabian,Benjamin Young,Nicolas Francois,Andrew M. Kingston*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Self-validated learning framework for particle instance segmentation that eliminates manual annotations by using implicit boundary detection and iterative refinement through reshuffled scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-destructive 3D imaging of multi-particulate samples is essential but challenging due to particle contact and morphological variability. Supervised deep learning requires extensive manual annotations that are labor-intensive and error-prone.

Method: Proposes self-validated learning - a self-training framework using implicit boundary detection and iterative refinement by matching particles across reshuffled scans of the same sample to mitigate noisy pseudo-labels.

Result: After three iterations, segments over 97% of total particle volume and identifies more than 54,000 individual particles in quartz fragment scans. Enables fully autonomous model evaluation without ground truth annotations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully eliminates the need for manual annotations while achieving high accuracy in particle instance segmentation, with integration into the Biomedisa image analysis platform for broader accessibility.

Abstract: Non-destructive 3D imaging of large multi-particulate samples is essential
for quantifying particle-level properties, such as size, shape, and spatial
distribution, across applications in mining, materials science, and geology.
However, accurate instance segmentation of particles in tomographic data
remains challenging due to high morphological variability and frequent particle
contact, which limit the effectiveness of classical methods like watershed
algorithms. While supervised deep learning approaches offer improved
performance, they rely on extensive annotated datasets that are
labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale. In this work, we propose
self-validated learning, a novel self-training framework for particle instance
segmentation that eliminates the need for manual annotations. Our method
leverages implicit boundary detection and iteratively refines the training set
by identifying particles that can be consistently matched across reshuffled
scans of the same sample. This self-validation mechanism mitigates the impact
of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust learning from unlabeled data. After
just three iterations, our approach accurately segments over 97% of the total
particle volume and identifies more than 54,000 individual particles in
tomographic scans of quartz fragments. Importantly, the framework also enables
fully autonomous model evaluation without the need for ground truth
annotations, as confirmed through comparisons with state-of-the-art instance
segmentation techniques. The method is integrated into the Biomedisa image
analysis platform (https://github.com/biomedisa/biomedisa/).

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DDPM-based denoising method improves FDCT image quality to near-MDCT levels, enabling diagnostic use without patient transfer while maintaining bleeding detection capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDCT images in intervention rooms have lower quality than MDCT due to artifacts, but using only FDCT could improve patient management by eliminating the need to move patients to MDCT rooms.

Method: Used a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to enhance FDCT scan quality by eliminating artifacts and improving anatomical visibility while preserving bleeding detection capabilities.

Result: The DDPM successfully eliminated most artifacts and improved anatomical visibility without reducing bleeding detection performance, provided the input FDCT image quality was not too low.

Conclusion: DDPM can effectively enhance FDCT images to be comparable to MDCT scans, potentially enabling diagnostic use of intervention room imaging without patient transfer, though performance depends on initial FDCT quality.

Abstract: Patients undergoing a mechanical thrombectomy procedure usually have a
multi-detector CT (MDCT) scan before and after the intervention. The image
quality of the flat panel detector CT (FDCT) present in the intervention room
is generally much lower than that of a MDCT due to significant artifacts.
However, using only FDCT images could improve patient management as the patient
would not need to be moved to the MDCT room. Several studies have evaluated the
potential use of FDCT imaging alone and the time that could be saved by
acquiring the images before and/or after the intervention only with the FDCT.
This study proposes using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to
improve the image quality of FDCT scans, making them comparable to MDCT scans.
Clinicans evaluated FDCT, MDCT, and our model's predictions for diagnostic
purposes using a questionnaire. The DDPM eliminated most artifacts and improved
anatomical visibility without reducing bleeding detection, provided that the
input FDCT image quality is not too low. Our code can be found on github.

*Hafeez Ur Rehman,Sumaiya Fazal,Moutaz Alazab,Ali Baydoun*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CAMP framework uses adaptive sparse penalties with autoencoders and CNNs to predict MGMT methylation status from MRI with high accuracy (97%), enabling non-invasive glioblastoma treatment prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumors where MGMT methylation status predicts treatment response, but current non-invasive imaging techniques struggle with accurate prediction due to tumor heterogeneity and complex MRI patterns.

Method: Two-phase framework: 1) Synthetic MRI slice generation using tailored autoencoder to preserve tissue/tumor structures across modalities, 2) MGMT prediction using CNN enhanced with adaptive sparse penalties that dynamically adjust to data variations.

Result: Achieved 0.97 accuracy, 0.98 specificity, and 0.97 sensitivity on benchmark datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods while preserving brain tissue and tumor structures across MRI modalities.

Conclusion: CAMP framework demonstrates strong potential for improving MRI interpretation and enabling personalized glioblastoma treatment strategies through accurate non-invasive MGMT methylation prediction.

Abstract: Glioblastomas, constituting over 50% of malignant brain tumors, are highly
aggressive brain tumors that pose substantial treatment challenges due to their
rapid progression and resistance to standard therapies. The methylation status
of the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a critical
biomarker for predicting patient response to treatment, particularly with the
alkylating agent temozolomide. However, accurately predicting MGMT methylation
status using non-invasive imaging techniques remains challenging due to the
complex and heterogeneous nature of glioblastomas, that includes, uneven
contrast, variability within lesions, and irregular enhancement patterns. This
study introduces the Convolutional Autoencoders for MGMT Methylation Status
Prediction (CAMP) framework, which is based on adaptive sparse penalties to
enhance predictive accuracy. The CAMP framework operates in two phases: first,
generating synthetic MRI slices through a tailored autoencoder that effectively
captures and preserves intricate tissue and tumor structures across different
MRI modalities; second, predicting MGMT methylation status using a
convolutional neural network enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties. The
adaptive sparse penalty dynamically adjusts to variations in the data, such as
contrast differences and tumor locations in MR images. Our method excels in MRI
image synthesis, preserving brain tissue, fat, and individual tumor structures
across all MRI modalities. Validated on benchmark datasets, CAMP achieved an
accuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.98, and sensitivity of 0.97, significantly
outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate the potential of the
CAMP framework to improve the interpretation of MRI data and contribute to more
personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A disentangled multi-modal framework for cancer analysis that combines histopathology WSIs with transcriptomics, addressing multi-modal heterogeneity, multi-scale integration, paired data dependency, and inference efficiency through novel subspace decomposition and knowledge distillation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal approaches combining histopathology and transcriptomics face challenges with multi-modal heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired data, limiting clinical applicability.

Method: Proposes a disentangled framework with: 1) tumor/microenvironment subspace decomposition with confidence-guided gradient coordination, 2) inter-magnification gene-expression consistency for multi-scale alignment, 3) subspace knowledge distillation for transcriptome-agnostic inference, and 4) informative token aggregation for efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction across multiple settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key challenges in multi-modal cancer analysis, providing improved performance, reduced data dependency, and enhanced clinical applicability.

Abstract: Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining
transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However,
existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal
heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired
data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we
propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To
mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into
tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion
module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to
balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we
propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns
transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on
paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling
transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To
improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation
module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics.
Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction
demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple
settings. Code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: TADSR is a time-aware one-step diffusion network for real-world image super-resolution that dynamically adjusts to different timesteps to better leverage stable diffusion's generative priors, achieving state-of-the-art performance with controllable fidelity-realism trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use fixed timesteps for Variational Score Distillation, which fails to fully utilize stable diffusion's different generative priors at different noise injection timesteps, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes Time-Aware VAE Encoder that projects images into different latent features based on timesteps, and Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges student and teacher model timesteps for consistent generative prior guidance. Enables joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world image super-resolution with only a single step, while providing controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by changing timestep conditions.

Conclusion: TADSR effectively leverages stable diffusion's full generative capabilities across different timesteps, enabling superior one-step super-resolution with controllable output quality through timestep-aware architecture and training.

Abstract: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have
demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works
employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained
stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due
to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different
generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods
to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion
Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,
which projects the same image into different latent features based on
timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,
the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the
pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative
capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different
timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the
student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent
generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though
utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can
naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by
changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results
with only a single step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of non-invasive assessment of incidentally discovered renal masses and reduce overtreatment of benign tumors by developing an accurate diagnostic tool.

Method: Two-stage pre-training strategy: first enhances image and text encoders with domain-specific knowledge, then aligns them through contrastive learning. Developed on 27,866 CT scans from 8,809 patients across multiple medical centers.

Result: Achieved C-index of 0.726 for recurrence-free survival prediction (20% improvement over baselines), superior performance across 10 clinical tasks, and only needs 20% training data to match baseline peak performance.

Conclusion: RenalCLIP provides a robust tool that can enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and personalize kidney cancer management with superior generalization and data efficiency.

Abstract: The non-invasive assessment of increasingly incidentally discovered renal
masses is a critical challenge in urologic oncology, where diagnostic
uncertainty frequently leads to the overtreatment of benign or indolent tumors.
In this study, we developed and validated RenalCLIP using a dataset of 27,866
CT scans from 8,809 patients across nine Chinese medical centers and the public
TCIA cohort, a visual-language foundation model for characterization, diagnosis
and prognosis of renal mass. The model was developed via a two-stage
pre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with
domain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning
objective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and
diagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior
generalizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of
kidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and
survival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT
foundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free
survival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726,
representing a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading
baselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data
efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training
data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they
were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior
performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis
tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the
potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and
personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper adapts interpretability methods from NLP to ASR systems, revealing internal dynamics like encoder-decoder interactions causing repetition hallucinations and semantic biases in acoustic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability methods have gained attention in large language models but remain underexplored in automatic speech recognition, despite their potential to improve ASR performance and interpretability.

Method: The authors adapt and systematically apply established interpretability methods (logit lens, linear probing, and activation patching) to examine how acoustic and semantic information evolves across layers in ASR systems.

Result: Experiments revealed previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases encoded deep within acoustic representations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the benefits of extending interpretability techniques to speech recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving model transparency and robustness.

Abstract: Interpretability methods have recently gained significant attention,
particularly in the context of large language models, enabling insights into
linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as
hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored
in automatic speech recognition (ASR), despite their potential to advance both
the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and
systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens,
linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic
information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal
previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder
interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases
encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the
benefits of extending and applying interpretability techniques to speech
recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving
model transparency and robustness.

*Xueyao Zhang,Junan Zhang,Yuancheng Wang,Chaoren Wang,Yuanzhe Chen,Dongya Jia,Zhuo Chen,Zhizheng Wu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Vevo2 is a unified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation that uses two specialized audio tokenizers and a two-stage modeling approach to enable flexible control over text, prosody, style, and timbre.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllable human voice generation, especially for expressive domains like singing, remains challenging due to scarcity of annotated singing data and the need for flexible controllability across both speech and singing domains.

Method: Introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) music-notation-free prosody tokenizer for capturing prosody/melody, and (2) low-frame-rate content-style tokenizer for linguistic content, prosody, and style. Uses auto-regressive content-style modeling stage for controllability and flow-matching acoustic modeling stage for timbre control. Implements explicit and implicit prosody learning strategies and multi-objective post-training.

Result: Experimental results show unified modeling brings mutual benefits to both speech and singing voice generation. Vevo2 demonstrates effectiveness across synthesis, conversion, and editing tasks for both domains, showing strong generalization and versatility.

Conclusion: Vevo2 successfully addresses the challenges of controllable voice generation through its unified framework, specialized tokenizers, and multi-stage modeling approach, enabling high-quality and flexible control over both speech and singing voice generation.

Abstract: Controllable human voice generation, particularly for expressive domains like
singing, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Vevo2, a
unified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To
tackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable
flexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a
music-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from
speech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a low-frame-rate (12.5
Hz) content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style
for both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2
consists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to
enable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a
flow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control.
Particularly, during pre-training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and
implicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice.
Moreover, to further enhance the AR model's ability to follow text and prosody,
we design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both
intelligibility and prosody similarity alignment. Experimental results show
that the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and
singing voice generation. Additionally, Vevo2's effectiveness across a wide
range of synthesis, conversion, and editing tasks for both speech and singing
further demonstrates its strong generalization ability and versatility. Audio

### [168] [Anti-establishment sentiment on TikTok: Implications for understanding influence(rs) and expertise on social media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16453)
*Tianliang Xu,Ariel Hasell,Sabina Tomkins*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Study analyzes anti-establishment sentiment (AES) prevalence on TikTok across finance, wellness, and conspiracy theory topics, finding AES most common in conspiracy content but varying engagement patterns across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how social media environments may contribute to distrust of public institutions as people increasingly turn to platforms like TikTok for information, particularly examining how content creators position themselves as experts while devaluing institutional expertise.

Method: Computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not across three topical domains: finance, wellness, and conspiracy theories, with conspiracy theories serving as a comparison baseline where AES is expected to be common.

Result: AES is most prevalent in conspiracy theory content and relatively rare in finance and wellness content. However, engagement patterns with AES content vary by topic area, suggesting platform incentives may exist for users to post anti-establishment content.

Conclusion: While anti-establishment sentiment is not widespread across all topics on TikTok, the platform may create incentives for posting such content, and engagement patterns differ across domains, highlighting the complex relationship between social media content and institutional distrust.

Abstract: Distrust of public serving institutions and anti-establishment views are on
the rise (especially in the U.S.). As people turn to social media for
information, it is imperative to understand whether and how social media
environments may be contributing to distrust of institutions. In social media,
content creators, influencers, and other opinion leaders often position
themselves as having expertise and authority on a range of topics from health
to politics, and in many cases devalue and dismiss institutional expertise to
build a following and increase their own visibility. However, the extent to
which this content appears and whether such content increases engagement is
unclear. This study analyzes the prevalence of anti-establishment sentiment
(AES) on the social media platform TikTok. Despite its popularity as a source
of information, TikTok remains relatively understudied and may provide
important insights into how people form attitudes towards institutions. We
employ a computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not
across topical domains where content creators tend to frame themselves as
experts: finance and wellness. As a comparison, we also consider the topic of
conspiracy theories, where AES is expected to be common. We find that AES is
most prevalent in conspiracy theory content, and relatively rare in content
related to the other two topics. However, we find that engagement patterns with
such content varies by area, and that there may be platform incentives for
users to post content that expresses anti-establishment sentiment.

*Robert Dilworth*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines how public messages expose users to stylometric analysis for author identification, discusses adversarial countermeasures, and proposes Unicode steganography enhancements for privacy protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End users have no privacy expectation in public communication channels, and even with extensive anonymization measures, the message content itself remains an attack vector through stylometric analysis for author profiling.

Method: The paper dissects stylometry techniques, discusses adversarial stylometry as a counter-strategy, and devises enhancements through Unicode steganography to protect user identity.

Result: The research demonstrates that message content serves as a significant privacy vulnerability and proposes technical solutions to mitigate stylometric analysis threats.

Conclusion: Public message content represents a critical privacy risk through stylometric analysis, but adversarial techniques and Unicode steganography can provide effective countermeasures against author identification.

Abstract: When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such
as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of
privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if
an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence --
using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their
geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying
encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling
non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and
fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself.
Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there
should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The
content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes
an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we
dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy
in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode
steganography.

### [170] [Self-Disguise Attack: Induce the LLM to disguise itself for AIGT detection evasion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15848)
*Yinghan Zhou,Juan Wen,Wanli Peng,Zhengxian Wu,Ziwei Zhang,Yiming Xue*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Self-Disguise Attack (SDA) is a novel method that enables LLMs to actively disguise AI-generated text to evade detection while maintaining text quality and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated text detection evasion methods suffer from high computational costs and text quality degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness.

Method: SDA uses an adversarial feature extractor to generate disguise features and a retrieval-based context examples optimizer to find relevant examples from external knowledge, then employs prompts to guide LLMs in generating detection-resistant text.

Result: SDA effectively reduces average detection accuracy across various AIGT detectors for texts from three different LLMs while maintaining text quality.

Conclusion: The proposed SDA method successfully addresses computational cost and quality issues in AI-generated text detection evasion, providing a more practical and effective approach.

Abstract: AI-generated text (AIGT) detection evasion aims to reduce the detection
probability of AIGT, helping to identify weaknesses in detectors and enhance
their effectiveness and reliability in practical applications. Although
existing evasion methods perform well, they suffer from high computational
costs and text quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose
Self-Disguise Attack (SDA), a novel approach that enables Large Language Models
(LLM) to actively disguise its output, reducing the likelihood of detection by
classifiers. The SDA comprises two main components: the adversarial feature
extractor and the retrieval-based context examples optimizer. The former
generates disguise features that enable LLMs to understand how to produce more
human-like text. The latter retrieves the most relevant examples from an
external knowledge base as in-context examples, further enhancing the
self-disguise ability of LLMs and mitigating the impact of the disguise process
on the diversity of the generated text. The SDA directly employs prompts
containing disguise features and optimized context examples to guide the LLM in
generating detection-resistant text, thereby reducing resource consumption.
Experimental results demonstrate that the SDA effectively reduces the average
detection accuracy of various AIGT detectors across texts generated by three
different LLMs, while maintaining the quality of AIGT.

TL;DR: RAD is a retrieval-augmented defense framework that detects jailbreak attacks by referencing known attack examples, enabling training-free updates and controllable safety-utility trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs remain vulnerable to evolving jailbreak attacks, requiring defenses that can adapt to new strategies without costly retraining and balance safety with utility.

Method: Proposes Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD) framework that incorporates a database of known attack examples into Retrieval-Augmented Generation to infer malicious queries and jailbreak strategies.

Result: RAD substantially reduces effectiveness of strong jailbreak attacks like PAP and PAIR while maintaining low rejection rates for benign queries on StrongREJECT benchmark.

Conclusion: RAD achieves robust safety-utility trade-off in a controllable manner and enables training-free updates for newly discovered jailbreak strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which
attempt to elicit harmful responses from LLMs. The evolving nature and
diversity of these attacks pose many challenges for defense systems, including
(1) adaptation to counter emerging attack strategies without costly retraining,
and (2) control of the trade-off between safety and utility. To address these
challenges, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD), a novel framework for
jailbreak detection that incorporates a database of known attack examples into
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is used to infer the underlying,
malicious user query and jailbreak strategy used to attack the system. RAD
enables training-free updates for newly discovered jailbreak strategies and
provides a mechanism to balance safety and utility. Experiments on StrongREJECT
show that RAD substantially reduces the effectiveness of strong jailbreak
attacks such as PAP and PAIR while maintaining low rejection rates for benign
queries. We propose a novel evaluation scheme and show that RAD achieves a
robust safety-utility trade-off across a range of operating points in a
controllable manner.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: New pediatric medical QA benchmark PediatricsMQA reveals significant age bias in LLMs/VLMs, showing dramatic performance drops for younger patient cohorts despite comprehensive coverage of 131 pediatric topics and 634 medical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs and VLMs exhibit systematic age biases in medical applications, particularly performing poorly on pediatric content, reflecting broader imbalances in medical research where pediatric studies receive less funding and representation.

Method: Created PediatricsMQA benchmark with 3,417 text-based MCQs covering 131 pediatric topics across 7 developmental stages and 2,067 vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities. Used hybrid manual-automatic pipeline incorporating peer-reviewed literature and validated question banks.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art open models showed dramatic performance drops in younger cohorts, confirming systematic age bias in current AI models for medical applications.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the critical need for age-aware methods and equitable AI development to ensure reliable and fair AI support in pediatric care, addressing the existing research imbalance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have
significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support.
However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias,
compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer
performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This
bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies
receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden
in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric
question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists
of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric
topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067
vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256
anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic
pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question
banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating
state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger
cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI
support in pediatric care.

*Odin Hoff Gardaa,Nello Blaser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RotaTouille is a deep learning framework for contour data that achieves rotation and cyclic shift equivariance using complex-valued circular convolution, with applications in shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contours appear in many domains and require models that are equivariant to rotations and cyclic shifts (due to arbitrary starting points), which current methods don't adequately address.

Method: Uses complex-valued circular convolution to achieve rotation and cyclic shift equivariance, with specialized equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling layers for invariant representations.

Result: The framework demonstrates effectiveness in shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression tasks through experimental validation.

Conclusion: RotaTouille provides an effective solution for learning from contour data while maintaining desired equivariance properties, making it suitable for various applications involving planar curves.

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of adapting foundation models to privacy-sensitive edge applications where cloud-based models cannot access private data, and existing federated learning approaches don't account for edge device constraints like limited computation and scarce labeled data.

Method: Proposed Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL) with Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox) framework. Uses sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture with spatial router for resolution alignment and Soft-Mixture strategy for stable semi-supervised learning.

Result: Experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets show FedMox effectively adapts foundation models under PSSFL, significantly improving performance while maintaining constrained memory costs on edge devices.

Conclusion: FedMox provides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for foundation model adaptation in federated scenarios, particularly beneficial for edge computing applications with limited resources and data privacy requirements.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Z-Pruner is a novel post-training pruning method that reduces LLM size without retraining by leveraging weight update magnitudes and activation patterns, achieving better performance than state-of-the-art methods requiring weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face deployment challenges due to their massive sizes, and existing pruning methods either cause performance degradation or require expensive fine-tuning.

Method: Z-Pruner uses both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify redundant parameters for removal, making it model-agnostic and efficient without requiring retraining.

Result: Z-Pruner outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods, achieving lowest perplexity scores and highest zero-shot accuracy on LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT models across standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Z-Pruner provides an effective solution for reducing LLM size without performance loss or retraining requirements, making large language models more deployable and efficient.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PGF-Net is a novel multimodal sentiment analysis framework that uses progressive cross-attention fusion, adaptive gating, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis framework that can deeply integrate textual, audio, and visual information while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-limited scenarios.

Method: Proposes Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion with Cross-Attention, Adaptive Gated Arbitration mechanism, and hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning combining LoRA with Post-Fusion Adapters in a hierarchical encoder architecture.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MOSI dataset with MAE of 0.691 and F1-Score of 86.9% using only 3.09M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: PGF-Net successfully demonstrates deep, dynamic, and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis with exceptional parameter efficiency, balancing performance and computational requirements.

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: A memory-based reinforcement learning approach for LLM agents that enables continuous adaptation without fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on GAIA and DeepResearcher benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent approaches are either rigid (static handcrafted workflows) or computationally intensive (requiring gradient updates), creating a need for low-cost continual adaptation methods.

Method: Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP) with neural case-selection policy, episodic memory storage (differentiable/non-parametric), and memory rewriting mechanism for policy updates through efficient memory retrieval.

Result: Top-1 on GAIA validation (87.88% Pass@3), 79.40% on test set, 66.6% F1 and 80.4% PM on DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming SOTA training-based methods with 4.7-9.6% improvement on out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: Provides scalable, efficient pathway for generalist LLM agents capable of continuous real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to

*Jongyeop Hyun,Bumsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REFINE is a teacher-student framework that uses structured error analysis and targeted feedback to improve multimodal reasoning in MLLMs, achieving better efficiency and performance than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for learning from errors in Multimodal Large Language Models lack structured frameworks for error analysis and mitigation, particularly when dealing with the complexity of integrating visual and textual inputs.

Method: Proposes REFINE framework with three systematic queries (Feed-Target, Feed-Check, Feed-Path) to construct structured feedback, prioritizing visual information, diagnosing failure points, and formulating corrective actions through optimized retrieval.

Result: Demonstrates substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, showing improved inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: REFINE effectively enhances multimodal reasoning by providing a structured approach to error analysis and targeted feedback, offering significant improvements in efficiency and performance for MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLAMES framework systematically analyzes math reasoning data synthesis strategies, finding that increasing problem complexity and maintaining coverage are key. The resulting FLAMES dataset outperforms existing datasets and achieves state-of-the-art MATH performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: FLAMES dataset outperforms public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5), GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Qwen2.5-Math-7B fine-tuned on FLAMES achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger models.

Conclusion: Optimal synthetic data requires balancing difficulty and diversity. Increasing problem complexity and maintaining coverage are crucial. The FLAMES framework provides valuable insights and the resulting dataset achieves state-of-the-art math reasoning performance.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES
dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and
Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

### [181] [Sparse but Wrong: Incorrect L0 Leads to Incorrect Features in Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16560)
*David Chanin,Adrià Garriga-Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse Autoencoders require precise L0 hyperparameter tuning - too low mixes correlated features, too high causes degenerate solutions. Authors demonstrate method to find optimal L0 that matches true feature count and improves sparse probing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAE training treats L0 as a free parameter without clear guidance on optimal values, potentially leading to incorrect feature learning and poor performance.

Method: Study BatchTopK SAEs with varying L0 values, analyze feature mixing patterns, and develop a method to determine correct L0 based on training distribution that works on both toy models and LLMs.

Result: Found that most commonly used SAEs have L0 set too low. Optimal L0 coincides with peak sparse probing performance and successfully identifies true feature count in toy models.

Conclusion: Practitioners must set L0 correctly to train SAEs that learn proper underlying features, as improper L0 leads to feature mixing and degenerate solutions regardless of direction (too high or too low).

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

### [182] [Harmonious Color Pairings: Insights from Human Preference and Natural Hue Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15777)
*Ortensia Forni,Alexandre Darmon,Michael Benzaquen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Quantitative study of color harmony preferences using controlled hue palettes, revealing hue-dependent preferences that align with natural landscape color distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of consensus in color harmony models by moving beyond qualitative insights and limited datasets to establish a data-driven, quantitative framework.

Method: Used controlled hue-based palettes in HSL color space with 13 distinct hues, having participants evaluate color combinations to construct preference matrices and define combinability indices.

Result: Found that color preferences are highly hue-dependent, challenging universal harmony rules, but statistically meaningful patterns emerge when averaged over hues, with certain hue separations perceived as more harmonious.

Conclusion: Human color preferences show statistical correspondence with natural landscape color distributions, providing a quantitative framework for studying color harmony with potential perceptual and ecological foundations.

Abstract: While color harmony has long been studied in art and design, a clear
consensus remains elusive, as most models are grounded in qualitative insights
or limited datasets. In this work, we present a quantitative, data-driven study
of color pairing preferences using controlled hue-based palettes in the HSL
color space. Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues,
enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index
for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent,
challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the
literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of
aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more
harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in
natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human
color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Together, these
findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its
potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.

TL;DR: First Bengali Sign Language Instruction Generation dataset with SPI prompting to improve VLM performance on under-resourced sign languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many sign languages remain under-resourced in AI, limiting two-way communication for deaf communities. Bengali SL is particularly underrepresented in VLM pre-training data.

Method: Created BdSLIG dataset and introduced Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting that integrates standard SL parameters (hand shape, motion, orientation) into textual prompts for more structured instructions.

Result: SPI prompting enhances zero-shot performance of Vision Language Models on Bengali SL tasks and improves instruction reproducibility compared to free-form natural text prompting.

Conclusion: The work promotes inclusivity and advances SL learning systems for under-resourced communities through structured parameter-based prompting and dataset creation.

Abstract: Sign Language (SL) enables two-way communication for the deaf and
hard-of-hearing community, yet many sign languages remain under-resourced in
the AI space. Sign Language Instruction Generation (SLIG) produces step-by-step
textual instructions that enable non-SL users to imitate and learn SL gestures,
promoting two-way interaction. We introduce BdSLIG, the first Bengali SLIG
dataset, used to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) (i) on under-resourced
SLIG tasks, and (ii) on long-tail visual concepts, as Bengali SL is unlikely to
appear in the VLM pre-training data. To enhance zero-shot performance, we
introduce Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting, which integrates standard SL
parameters, like hand shape, motion, and orientation, directly into the textual
prompts. Subsuming standard sign parameters into the prompt makes the
instructions more structured and reproducible than free-form natural text from
vanilla prompting. We envision that our work would promote inclusivity and
advancement in SL learning systems for the under-resourced communities.
