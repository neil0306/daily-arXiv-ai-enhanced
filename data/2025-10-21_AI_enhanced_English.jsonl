Yet, current\ngenerative gesture generation approaches are restricted to simple, repetitive\nbeat gestures that accompany the rhythm of speaking but do not contribute to\ncommunicating semantic meaning. This paper tackles a core challenge in\nco-speech gesture synthesis: generating iconic or deictic gestures that are\nsemantically coherent with a verbal utterance. Such gestures cannot be derived\nfrom language input alone, which inherently lacks the visual meaning that is\noften carried autonomously by gestures. We therefore introduce a zero-shot\nsystem that generates gestures from a given language input and additionally is\ninformed by imagistic input, without manual annotation or human intervention.\nOur method integrates an image analysis pipeline that extracts key object\nproperties such as shape, symmetry, and alignment, together with a semantic\nmatching module that links these visual details to spoken text. An inverse\nkinematics engine then synthesizes iconic and deictic gestures and combines\nthem with co-generated natural beat gestures for coherent multimodal\ncommunication. A comprehensive user study demonstrates the effectiveness of our\napproach. In scenarios where speech alone was ambiguous, gestures generated by\nour system significantly improved participants' ability to identify object\nproperties, confirming their interpretability and communicative value.
