Conclusion: Moxin represents a significant step toward sustainable open-source LLM development by providing complete transparency and fostering collaborative research, with specialized variants extending capabilities across different domains while maintaining open-source principles.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Moxin 7B is introduced as a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework, which moves beyond the simple sharing of model weights to embrace complete transparency in training, datasets, and implementation detail, thus fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research environment that can sustain a healthy open-source ecosystem. To further equip Moxin with various capabilities in different tasks, we develop three variants based on Moxin, including Moxin-VLM, Moxin-VLA, and Moxin-Chinese, which target the vision-language, vision-language-action, and Chinese capabilities, respectively. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations. We adopt open-source framework and open data for the training. We release our models, along with the available data and code to derive these models.

### [2] [Hierarchical Geometry of Cognitive States in Transformer Embedding Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22227)
*Sophie Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer sentence embeddings encode hierarchical cognitive structure aligned with human-annotated attributes, decodable via linear/nonlinear probes beyond surface word statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While transformer language models show rich geometric structure, it's unclear if they encode higher-level cognitive organization aligned with human-interpretable psychological attributes.

Method: Created dataset of 480 sentences annotated with continuous energy scores and discrete tier labels across 7 cognitive categories. Used fixed embeddings from multiple transformer models, evaluated recoverability via linear and shallow nonlinear probes, compared to TF-IDF baselines, and conducted nonparametric permutation tests.

Result: Both continuous scores and tier labels were reliably decodable across models, with nonlinear probes outperforming linear ones. TF-IDF performed substantially worse. Permutation tests confirmed performance exceeded chance. Visualizations showed smooth gradients and adjacent-tier confusions in embedding space.

Conclusion: Transformer embedding spaces exhibit hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human-defined cognitive attributes, though this doesn't imply internal awareness or phenomenology.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that transformer-based language models learn rich geometric structure in their embedding spaces, yet the presence of higher-level cognitive organization within these representations remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether sentence embeddings encode a graded, hierarchical structure aligned with human-interpretable cognitive or psychological attributes. We construct a dataset of 480 natural-language sentences annotated with continuous ordinal energy scores and discrete tier labels spanning seven ordered cognitive categories. Using fixed sentence embeddings from multiple transformer models, we evaluate the recoverability of these annotations via linear and shallow nonlinear probes. Across models, both continuous scores and tier labels are reliably decodable, with shallow nonlinear probes providing consistent performance gains over linear probes. Lexical TF-IDF baselines perform substantially worse, indicating that the observed structure is not attributable to surface word statistics alone. Nonparametric permutation tests further confirm that probe performance exceeds chance under label-randomization nulls. Qualitative analyses using UMAP visualizations and confusion matrices reveal smooth low-to-high gradients and predominantly adjacent-tier confusions in embedding space. Taken together, these results provide evidence that transformer embedding spaces exhibit a hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human-defined cognitive attributes, while remaining agnostic to claims of internal awareness or phenomenology.

### [3] [SmartSnap: Proactive Evidence Seeking for Self-Verifying Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22322)
*Shaofei Cai,Yulei Qin,Haojia Lin,Zihan Xu,Gang Li,Yuchen Shi,Zongyi Li,Yong Mao,Siqi Cai,Xiaoyu Tan,Yitao Liang,Ke Li,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SmartSnap introduces self-verifying agents that proactively collect snapshot evidence during task execution, enabling scalable reinforcement learning for GUI tasks by reducing verification costs and improving reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic RL for GUI tasks faces scalability issues due to expensive and unreliable post-hoc verification methods that process entire verbose interaction trajectories containing irrelevant noise.

Method: Proposes SmartSnap paradigm with Self-Verifying Agents that perform dual missions: task completion and evidence collection. Agents follow 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, Creativity) to curate minimal, decisive snapshots during execution for LLM-as-a-Judge verification.

Result: Experiments on mobile tasks show performance gains up to 26.08% for 8B models and 16.66% for 30B models. The approach enables scalable training of LLM-driven agents with competitive performance against larger models like DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

Conclusion: SmartSnap represents a paradigm shift from passive post-hoc verification to proactive in-situ self-verification, creating efficient agents that synergize solution finding with evidence seeking for scalable RL in complex GUI environments.

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

*Zubaida Mohammed Albadani,Mohammed Q. Shormani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of qulk-clauses in Yemeni Ibbi Arabic within Minimalist Program, proposing they are biclausal structures with qulk as clause-embedding predicate selecting full CP complement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the syntax of qulk-clauses in Yemeni Ibbi Arabic within the Minimalist Program framework, as these constructions introduce embedded declarative, interrogative, and imperative clauses without complementizers, presenting an interesting syntactic puzzle.

Method: Applying core minimalist operations (Merge, Move, Agree, Spell-out) to provide layered syntactic analysis of qulk-clauses, examining their derivation through computational steps and post-syntactic processes like Morphological Merger.

Result: Qulk-clauses are biclausal structures where qulk functions as clause-embedding predicate selecting full CP complement. The analysis accounts for dialect-specific features including bipartite negation, cliticization, and CP embedding.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to generative syntax/minimalism, raise questions about extending analysis to addressee-clause kil-k 'you said', and provide insights into the universality of minimalist principles.

Abstract: This study investigates the syntax of qulk-clauses in Yemeni Ibbi Arabic (YIA) within the Minimalist Program. The construction qulk-clause, a morphologically fused form meaning 'I said,' introduces embedded declarative interrogative, and imperative clauses, often eithout complementizer. The central proposal of this paper is that qulk-clauses are biclausal structures in which qulk functions a clause-embedding predicate sec;ecting a dull CP complement. By applying core minimalist operations, viz., Merge, Move, Agree, and Spell-out, the study provides a layered syntactic analysis of qulk-clauses, for illustrating how their derivation proceeds through standard computational steps and post-syntactic processes such as Morphological Merger. The proposal also accounts for dialect-specific features like bipartite negation, cliticization, and CP embedding. The findings offer theoretical contributions to generative syntax, specifically minimalism. The study concludes raising theoretical questions concerning extending the analysis to the addressee-clause kil-k 'you said'. It also provides insights into the possibility of the universality of minimalism.

### [5] [Towards Efficient Post-Training via Fourier-Driven Adapter Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22378)
*Donggyun Bae,Jongil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method using Fourier features in adapters to modulate frequency components, achieving competitive performance with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for large language models that can selectively modulate semantic information through frequency-aware adaptation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Uses Fourier-Activated Adapters with random Fourier features to decompose representations into low- and high-frequency components, enabling frequency-aware modulation through adaptive weighting mechanisms while keeping the backbone frozen.

Result: Consistently achieves competitive or superior performance on GLUE, E2E NLG, and instruction-tuning benchmarks compared to existing PEFT methods, with low computational and memory overhead.

Conclusion: FAA is a robust and efficient approach for post-training large language models, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its frequency-aware activation and adaptive weighting mechanisms.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework, termed Fourier-Activated Adapter (FAA), for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained language models. By incorporating random Fourier features into lightweight adapter modules, FAA decomposes intermediate representations into complementary low- and high-frequency components, enabling frequency-aware modulation of semantic information. This design allows the model to selectively emphasize informative frequency bands during adaptation while preserving the representational capacity of the frozen backbone. Extensive experiments on GLUE, E2E NLG, and instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FAA consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while maintaining low computational and memory overhead. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of frequency-aware activation and adaptive weighting mechanisms, highlighting FAA as a robust and efficient approach for post-training large language models.

### [6] [LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection for Few-Shot Wearable-Sensor Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22385)
*Elsen Ronando,Sozo Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection framework improves few-shot Human Activity Recognition by using LLM-generated semantic priors to select better exemplars, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HAR methods rely on large labeled datasets and purely geometric exemplar selection, which fail to distinguish similar wearable sensor activities like walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs.

Method: Incorporates LLM-generated knowledge priors (feature importance, inter-class confusability, exemplar budget multipliers) combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization for exemplar selection.

Result: Achieves macro F1-score of 88.78% on UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, outperforming random sampling, herding, and k-center approaches.

Conclusion: LLM-derived semantic priors integrated with structural and geometric cues provide stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection framework to address a key limitation in state-of-the-art Human Activity Recognition (HAR) methods: their reliance on large labeled datasets and purely geometric exemplar selection, which often fail to distinguish similar weara-ble sensor activities such as walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Our method incorporates semantic reasoning via an LLM-generated knowledge prior that captures feature importance, inter-class confusability, and exemplar budget multipliers, and uses it to guide exemplar scoring and selection. These priors are combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization to obtain a compact and informative set of exemplars. Evaluated on the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches such as random sampling, herding, and $k$-center. The results show that LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.

### [7] [Hallucination Detection and Evaluation of Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22416)
*Chenggong Zhang,Haopeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HHEM framework reduces hallucination evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes while maintaining high accuracy (82.2%), though struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination evaluation methods like KnowHalu have high computational costs, creating a need for more efficient detection frameworks that maintain accuracy.

Method: Introduces Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a lightweight classification-based framework independent of LLM-based judgments, with segment-based retrieval for localized hallucination detection in summarization tasks.

Result: HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes, achieves 82.2% accuracy and 78.9% TPR on QA tasks. Larger models (7B-9B parameters) show fewer hallucinations, while intermediate models exhibit higher instability.

Conclusion: Structured evaluation frameworks balancing computational efficiency with robust factual validation are needed to enhance LLM reliability, with HHEM providing an efficient alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a significant challenge, generating misleading or unverifiable content that undermines trust and reliability. Existing evaluation methods, such as KnowHalu, employ multi-stage verification but suffer from high computational costs. To address this, we integrate the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a lightweight classification-based framework that operates independently of LLM-based judgments, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high detection accuracy. We conduct a comparative analysis of hallucination detection methods across various LLMs, evaluating True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and Accuracy on question-answering (QA) and summarization tasks. Our results show that HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes, while HHEM with non-fabrication checking achieves the highest accuracy \(82.2\%\) and TPR \(78.9\%\). However, HHEM struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks. To address this, we introduce segment-based retrieval, improving detection by verifying smaller text components. Additionally, our cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis indicates that larger models (7B-9B parameters) generally exhibit fewer hallucinations, while intermediate-sized models show higher instability. These findings highlight the need for structured evaluation frameworks that balance computational efficiency with robust factual validation, enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG systems face challenges with irrelevant retrieved information and misalignment between generated answers and user intent, especially in open-domain settings.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline with hierarchical filtering: uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for query formulation, hierarchical content filtering, and citation attribution (4-6x cheaper than Pro), then Gemini 2.5 Pro for final answer generation.

Conclusion: HiFi-RAG demonstrates that hierarchical filtering with cost-efficient LLMs for preprocessing and powerful LLMs for final generation can significantly improve RAG performance while reducing costs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in open-domain settings faces significant challenges regarding irrelevant information in retrieved documents and the alignment of generated answers with user intent. We present HiFi-RAG (Hierarchical Filtering RAG), the winning closed-source system in the Text-to-Text static evaluation of the MMU-RAGent NeurIPS 2025 Competition. Our approach moves beyond standard embedding-based retrieval via a multi-stage pipeline. We leverage the speed and cost-efficiency of Gemini 2.5 Flash (4-6x cheaper than Pro) for query formulation, hierarchical content filtering, and citation attribution, while reserving the reasoning capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro for final answer generation. On the MMU-RAGent validation set, our system outperformed the baseline, improving ROUGE-L to 0.274 (+19.6%) and DeBERTaScore to 0.677 (+6.2%). On Test2025, our custom dataset evaluating questions that require post-cutoff knowledge (post January 2025), HiFi-RAG outperforms the parametric baseline by 57.4% in ROUGE-L and 14.9% in DeBERTaScore.

### [9] [Exploring the Vertical-Domain Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22443)
*Jie Zhou,Xin Chen,Jie Zhang,Zhe Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs' accounting reasoning capabilities, establishes evaluation criteria, and tests models including GLM-series and GPT-4 on accounting tasks, finding GPT-4 performs best but still needs optimization for enterprise applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are transforming various domains, but integrating them effectively into professional fields like accounting requires understanding their domain-specific reasoning capabilities. The challenge is to redefine LLMs' relationship with domain-specific applications to promote enterprise digital transformation.

Method: Introduced the concept of vertical-domain accounting reasoning and established evaluation criteria by analyzing GLM-series training data characteristics. Evaluated several models (GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, GPT-4) on accounting reasoning tasks using different prompt engineering strategies.

Result: Different prompt strategies improved performance across models, with GPT-4 achieving the strongest accounting reasoning capability. However, current LLMs still fall short of real-world application requirements, particularly for enterprise-level accounting scenarios.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise for accounting applications, further optimization is needed for enterprise deployment. The established evaluation criteria provide benchmarks for improving accounting reasoning performance and serve as a foundation for future research on reasoning paradigms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping learning paradigms, cognitive processes, and research methodologies across a wide range of domains. Integrating LLMs with professional fields and redefining the relationship between LLMs and domain-specific applications has become a critical challenge for promoting enterprise digital transformation and broader social development. To effectively integrate LLMs into the accounting domain, it is essential to understand their domain-specific reasoning capabilities. This study introduces the concept of vertical-domain accounting reasoning and establishes evaluation criteria by analyzing the training data characteristics of representative GLM-series models. These criteria provide a foundation for subsequent research on reasoning paradigms and offer benchmarks for improving accounting reasoning performance. Based on this framework, we evaluate several representative models, including GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and OpenAI GPT-4, on a set of accounting reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that different prompt engineering strategies lead to varying degrees of performance improvement across models, with GPT-4 achieving the strongest accounting reasoning capability. However, current LLMs still fall short of real-world application requirements. In particular, further optimization is needed for deployment in enterprise-level accounting scenarios to fully realize the potential value of LLMs in this domain.

### [10] [Constituency Structure over Eojeol in Korean Treebanks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22487)
*Jungyeul Park,Chulwoo Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Korean constituency treebanks should use eojeol (word) units instead of morphemes as terminals to separate morphology from syntax and align with dependency resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Korean constituency treebanks use morphemes as terminals, which conflates word-internal morphology with phrase-level syntax and creates mismatches with eojeol-based dependency resources, making cross-resource comparison difficult.

Method: Proposes an eojeol-based constituency representation where morphological segmentation and fine-grained POS information are encoded in a separate, non-constituent layer. Performs comparative analysis showing Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks can be treated as representationally equivalent at eojeol level.

Result: Under explicit normalization assumptions, the Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks are representationally equivalent at the eojeol-based constituency level, enabling cross-treebank comparison and constituency-dependency conversion.

Conclusion: An eojeol-based annotation scheme preserves interpretable constituency structure while supporting cross-resource compatibility and conversion between constituency and dependency representations for Korean NLP.

Abstract: The design of Korean constituency treebanks raises a fundamental representational question concerning the choice of terminal units. Although Korean words are morphologically complex, treating morphemes as constituency terminals conflates word internal morphology with phrase level syntactic structure and creates mismatches with eojeol based dependency resources. This paper argues for an eojeol based constituency representation, with morphological segmentation and fine grained part of speech information encoded in a separate, non constituent layer. A comparative analysis shows that, under explicit normalization assumptions, the Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks can be treated as representationally equivalent at the eojeol based constituency level. Building on this result, we outline an eojeol based annotation scheme that preserves interpretable constituency and supports cross treebank comparison and constituency dependency conversion.

*Suhua Wang,Zifan Wang,Xiaoxin Sun,D. J. Wang,Zhanbo Liu,Xin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ManchuTTS: A novel TTS system for endangered Manchu language that addresses data scarcity and phonological agglutination through hierarchical text representation, cross-modal attention, and flow-matching Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manchu is an endangered language with severe data scarcity and strong phonological agglutination, making traditional TTS approaches inadequate. There's a need for specialized methods to handle these unique linguistic challenges.

Method: Three-tier text representation (phoneme, syllable, prosodic) with cross-modal hierarchical attention; deep convolutional networks integrated with flow-matching Transformer for non-autoregressive generation; hierarchical contrastive loss for acoustic-linguistic alignment; data augmentation for low-resource constraints.

Result: Achieves MOS of 4.52 using only 5.2-hour training subset; outperforms all baselines; hierarchical guidance improves agglutinative word pronunciation accuracy by 31% and prosodic naturalness by 27%.

Conclusion: ManchuTTS effectively addresses the unique challenges of Manchu TTS through specialized hierarchical modeling and data strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance despite severe resource constraints.

Abstract: As an endangered language, Manchu presents unique challenges for speech synthesis, including severe data scarcity and strong phonological agglutination. This paper proposes ManchuTTS(Manchu Text to Speech), a novel approach tailored to Manchu's linguistic characteristics. To handle agglutination, this method designs a three-tier text representation (phoneme, syllable, prosodic) and a cross-modal hierarchical attention mechanism for multi-granular alignment. The synthesis model integrates deep convolutional networks with a flow-matching Transformer, enabling efficient, non-autoregressive generation. This method further introduce a hierarchical contrastive loss to guide structured acoustic-linguistic correspondence. To address low-resource constraints, This method construct the first Manchu TTS dataset and employ a data augmentation strategy. Experiments demonstrate that ManchuTTS attains a MOS of 4.52 using a 5.2-hour training subset derived from our full 6.24-hour annotated corpus, outperforming all baseline models by a notable margin. Ablations confirm hierarchical guidance improves agglutinative word pronunciation accuracy (AWPA) by 31% and prosodic naturalness by 27%.

### [12] [Learning When Not to Attend Globally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22562)
*Xuan Luo,Kailai Zhang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AHA (All-or-Here Attention) enables LLMs to dynamically switch between full attention and local sliding window attention using binary routers, reducing up to 93% of full attention operations without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human reading behavior where we focus on current pages and only flip back when needed, the paper aims to make LLM attention more efficient by reducing redundant global context access.

Method: Proposes All-or-Here Attention (AHA) with binary routers per attention head that dynamically toggle between full attention and local sliding window attention for each token, allowing selective global context access.

Result: With 256-token window size, up to 93% of original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance degradation. Analysis shows long-tail distribution in context dependency where full attention necessity decays rapidly with larger windows.

Conclusion: Full attention is largely redundant, and efficient inference requires only on-demand access to global context. AHA demonstrates that decoupling local processing from global access enables significant computational savings.

Abstract: When reading books, humans focus primarily on the current page, flipping back to recap prior context only when necessary. Similarly, we demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn to dynamically determine when to attend to global context. We propose All-or-Here Attention (AHA), which utilizes a binary router per attention head to dynamically toggle between full attention and local sliding window attention for each token. Our results indicate that with a window size of 256 tokens, up to 93\% of the original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss. Furthermore, by evaluating AHA across various window sizes, we identify a long-tail distribution in context dependency, where the necessity for full attention decays rapidly as the local window expands. By decoupling local processing from global access, AHA reveals that full attention is largely redundant, and that efficient inference requires only on-demand access to the global context.

*Zhiqiang Gao,Shihao Gao,Zixing Zhang,Yihao Guo,Hongyu Chen,Jing Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a system for multimodal conversational sentiment analysis using structured prompting with LLMs for sentiment sextuple extraction and ensemble methods for sentiment flipping detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal conversational sentiment analysis is crucial for building emotionally intelligent AI systems, but extracting comprehensive sentiment information and detecting dynamic sentiment shifts from multi-speaker dialogues is challenging.

Method: For Subtask-I (sentiment sextuple extraction): designed a structured prompting pipeline that guides LLMs to sequentially extract sentiment components (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment, rationale) with refined contextual understanding. For Subtask-II (sentiment flipping detection): leveraged complementary strengths of three LLMs through ensembling to robustly identify sentiment transitions and their triggers.

Result: Achieved 47.38% average score on Subtask-I and 74.12% exact match F1 on Subtask-II, demonstrating effectiveness of step-wise refinement and ensemble strategies.

Conclusion: Structured prompting with LLMs and ensemble methods are effective approaches for complex multimodal sentiment analysis tasks, particularly for extracting comprehensive sentiment information and detecting dynamic sentiment shifts in conversations.

Abstract: Understanding sentiment in multimodal conversations is a complex yet crucial challenge toward building emotionally intelligent AI systems. The Multimodal Conversational Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (MCABSA) Challenge invited participants to tackle two demanding subtasks: (1) extracting a comprehensive sentiment sextuple, including holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment, and rationale from multi-speaker dialogues, and (2) detecting sentiment flipping, which detects dynamic sentiment shifts and their underlying triggers. For Subtask-I, in the present paper, we designed a structured prompting pipeline that guided large language models (LLMs) to sequentially extract sentiment components with refined contextual understanding. For Subtask-II, we further leveraged the complementary strengths of three LLMs through ensembling to robustly identify sentiment transitions and their triggers. Our system achieved a 47.38% average score on Subtask-I and a 74.12% exact match F1 on Subtask-II, showing the effectiveness of step-wise refinement and ensemble strategies in rich, multimodal sentiment analysis tasks.

*Chen Su,Yuanhe Tian,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: T3LLM is a framework using three LLMs (worker, reviewer, student) for time series question answering with explicit correction mechanisms to handle numerical reasoning errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for time series question answering adopt general NLP techniques and are prone to reasoning errors with complex numerical sequences. Time series data's inherent verifiability enables consistency checking between reasoning steps and original input.

Method: Proposes T3LLM framework with three LLMs: worker generates step-wise chains of thought under structured prompts, reviewer inspects reasoning, identifies errors, and provides corrective comments, and student learns from corrected CoT through fine-tuning to internalize multi-step reasoning and self-correction.

Result: Experiments on multiple real-world TSQA benchmarks demonstrate that T3LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance over strong LLM-based baselines.

Conclusion: The T3LLM framework effectively addresses reasoning errors in time series question answering by leveraging the verifiable nature of time series data through a collaborative multi-LLM approach with explicit correction mechanisms.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), diverse time series analysis tasks are reformulated as time series question answering (TSQA) through a unified natural language interface. However, existing LLM-based approaches largely adopt general natural language processing techniques and are prone to reasoning errors when handling complex numerical sequences. Different from purely textual tasks, time series data are inherently verifiable, enabling consistency checking between reasoning steps and the original input. Motivated by this property, we propose T3LLM, which performs multi-step reasoning with an explicit correction mechanism for time series question answering. The T3LLM framework consists of three LLMs, namely, a worker, a reviewer, and a student, that are responsible for generation, review, and reasoning learning, respectively. Within this framework, the worker generates step-wise chains of thought (CoT) under structured prompts, while the reviewer inspects the reasoning, identifies erroneous steps, and provides corrective comments. The collaboratively generated corrected CoT are used to fine-tune the student model, internalizing multi-step reasoning and self-correction into its parameters. Experiments on multiple real-world TSQA benchmarks demonstrate that T3LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance over strong LLM-based baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M2G-Eval is a multi-granularity, multilingual framework for evaluating code LLMs across 4 structural levels (Class, Function, Block, Line) and 18 programming languages, revealing hierarchical difficulty patterns and transferable programming concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks assess code LLMs at single structural granularity and limited languages, obscuring fine-grained capability variations across different code scopes and multilingual scenarios.

Method: Introduces M2G-Eval framework with 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 human-annotated test instances across 18 languages. Develops M2G-Eval-Coder models by training Qwen3-8B with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Evaluation of 30 models reveals: (1) difficulty hierarchy (Line easiest, Class hardest), (2) widening performance gaps between full- and partial-granularity languages with complexity, (3) strong cross-language correlations indicating transferable programming concepts.

Conclusion: M2G-Eval enables fine-grained diagnosis of code generation capabilities and highlights persistent challenges in synthesizing complex, long-form code, providing a comprehensive evaluation framework for multilingual code LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of code large language models (LLMs) has sparked significant research interest in systematically evaluating their code generation capabilities, yet existing benchmarks predominantly assess models at a single structural granularity and focus on limited programming languages, obscuring fine-grained capability variations across different code scopes and multilingual scenarios. We introduce M2G-Eval, a multi-granularity, multilingual framework for evaluating code generation in large language models (LLMs) across four levels: Class, Function, Block, and Line. Spanning 18 programming languages, M2G-Eval includes 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 human-annotated, contamination-controlled test instances. We develop M2G-Eval-Coder models by training Qwen3-8B with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. Evaluating 30 models (28 state-of-the-art LLMs plus our two M2G-Eval-Coder variants) reveals three main findings: (1) an apparent difficulty hierarchy, with Line-level tasks easiest and Class-level most challenging; (2) widening performance gaps between full- and partial-granularity languages as task complexity increases; and (3) strong cross-language correlations, suggesting that models learn transferable programming concepts. M2G-Eval enables fine-grained diagnosis of code generation capabilities and highlights persistent challenges in synthesizing complex, long-form code.

### [16] [On the Role of Discreteness in Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22630)
*Ziqi Jin,Bin Wang,Xiang Lin,Lidong Bing,Aixin Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes diffusion models for language generation, identifying key challenges in applying diffusion principles to text due to its discrete and structured nature, and proposes future directions for more coherent diffusion language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have appealing properties for language generation (parallel decoding, iterative refinement), but text's discrete and structured nature makes direct application challenging. The paper aims to bridge the gap between diffusion mechanics and language-specific requirements.

Method: The authors analyze diffusion language modeling by categorizing existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. They outline five essential properties separating diffusion mechanics from language requirements and evaluate how current approaches satisfy these properties.

Result: Analysis reveals that existing approaches represent structural trade-offs, each satisfying only part of the essential properties. Two central issues are identified: (1) uniform corruption doesn't respect information distribution across positions, and (2) token-wise marginal training can't capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding.

Conclusion: The findings motivate the development of diffusion processes that better align with text structure and encourage future work toward more coherent diffusion language models that can effectively handle the discrete and structured nature of language.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer appealing properties for language generation, such as parallel decoding and iterative refinement, but the discrete and highly structured nature of text challenges the direct application of diffusion principles. In this paper, we revisit diffusion language modeling from the view of diffusion process and language modeling, and outline five properties that separate diffusion mechanics from language-specific requirements. We first categorize existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. We then show that each satisfies only part of the five essential properties and therefore reflects a structural trade-off. Through analyses of recent large diffusion language models, we identify two central issues: (i) uniform corruption does not respect how information is distributed across positions, and (ii) token-wise marginal training cannot capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding. These observations motivate diffusion processes that align more closely with the structure of text, and encourage future work toward more coherent diffusion language models.

### [17] [Evaluating GRPO and DPO for Faithful Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22631)
*Hadi Mohammadi,Tamas Kozak,Anastasia Giachanou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRPO outperforms DPO for improving CoT faithfulness in LLMs, with Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct achieving best results, suggesting GRPO as promising for more transparent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT reasoning often fails to reflect models' actual reasoning processes, producing misleading justifications or modifying answers without acknowledging external cues, which undermines reliability for safety supervision and alignment monitoring.

Method: Evaluate two optimization methods - Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) - for improving CoT faithfulness across different model sizes.

Result: GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct attaining best results across all metrics. Both show positive correlation between model size and performance, but GRPO shows greater potential for improving faithfulness metrics.

Conclusion: GRPO offers a promising direction for developing more transparent and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs, addressing limitations in CoT faithfulness.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies show that CoT explanations often fail to reflect the model's actual reasoning process, as models may produce coherent yet misleading justifications or modify answers without acknowledging external cues. Such discrepancies undermine the reliability of CoT-based methods for safety supervision and alignment monitoring, as models can generate plausible but deceptive rationales for incorrect answers. To better understand this limitation, we evaluate two optimization methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in their ability to improve CoT faithfulness. Our experiments show that GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model attaining the best results across all evaluation metrics. Both approaches exhibit positive correlations between model size and performance, but GRPO shows greater potential for improving faithfulness metrics, albeit with less stable behavior at smaller scales. These results suggest that GRPO offers a promising direction for developing more transparent and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.

### [18] [Fragile Knowledge, Robust Instruction-Following: The Width Pruning Dichotomy in Llama-3.2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22671)
*Pere Martra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GLU-MLP width pruning guided by MAW criterion shows selective capability changes: factual knowledge degrades but instruction-following improves, with robust reasoning and interesting truthfulness-knowledge trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that pruning causes uniform degradation across all model capabilities, and to systematically characterize how structured width pruning affects different cognitive abilities in LLMs.

Method: Structured width pruning of GLU-MLP layers using Maximum Absolute Weight (MAW) criterion, evaluating seven expansion ratio configurations across comprehensive benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, IFEval, MUSR, TruthfulQA).

Result: Pruning creates systematic dichotomy: factual knowledge (MMLU) and perplexity degrade predictably, but instruction-following improves substantially (+46-75% in IFEval), multi-step reasoning remains robust, and truthfulness improves as knowledge degrades (inverse correlation r=-0.864).

Conclusion: Expansion ratio is a critical architectural parameter that selectively modulates cognitive capabilities; MAW-guided pruning acts as a selective filter reducing parametric knowledge while preserving/enhancing behavioral alignment, with energy efficiency benefits but latency trade-offs.

Abstract: Structured width pruning of GLU-MLP layers, guided by the Maximum Absolute Weight (MAW) criterion, reveals a systematic dichotomy in how reducing the expansion ratio affects different model capabilities. While performance on tasks relying on parametric knowledge (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) and perplexity metrics degrades predictably, instruction-following capabilities improve substantially (+46% to +75% in IFEval for Llama-3.2-1B and 3B models), and multi-step reasoning remains robust (MUSR). This pattern challenges the prevailing assumption that pruning induces uniform degradation. We evaluated seven expansion ratio configurations using comprehensive benchmarks assessing factual knowledge, mathematical reasoning, language comprehension, instruction-following, and truthfulness. Our analysis identifies the expansion ratio as a critical architectural parameter that selectively modulates cognitive capabilities, rather than merely serving as a compression metric. We provide the first systematic characterization of this selective preservation phenomenon. Notably, we document a robust inverse correlation (r = -0.864, p = 0.012 in Llama-3B) between factual knowledge capacity (MMLU) and truthfulness metrics (TruthfulQA-MC2): as knowledge degrades, the model's ability to discriminate misconceptions improves consistently. This connects two previously distinct research areas, demonstrating that MAW-guided width pruning acts as a selective filter, reducing parametric knowledge while preserving or enhancing behavioral alignment. Additionally, we quantify context-dependent efficiency trade-offs: pruned configurations achieve up to 23% reduction in energy consumption (J/token) but incur penalties in single-request latency, whereas batch processing workloads benefit uniformly.

### [19] [Conformal Prediction Sets for Next-Token Prediction in Large Language Models: Balancing Coverage Guarantees with Set Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22682)
*Yoshith Roy Kotla,Varshith Roy Kotla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VACP (Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction) improves uncertainty quantification for LLMs by reducing prediction set sizes 197x while maintaining coverage guarantees, addressing the coverage-efficiency tradeoff in large-vocabulary next-token prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need reliable uncertainty quantification for high-stakes applications, but standard softmax probabilities are poorly calibrated. Conformal prediction provides coverage guarantees but produces uninformative large prediction sets (hundreds of tokens) for large vocabularies (>250k tokens).

Method: Proposes Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP) framework that uses semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce the effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage. Applied to transformer-based models with large vocabularies.

Result: On Gemma-2B using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks, VACP achieves 89.7% empirical coverage (90% target) while reducing mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens - a 197x improvement in efficiency.

Conclusion: VACP effectively addresses the coverage-efficiency tradeoff in LLM uncertainty quantification, making conformal prediction practical for large-vocabulary models by dramatically reducing prediction set sizes while maintaining coverage guarantees.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains requires rigorous uncertainty quantification, yet standard softmax probabilities are often poorly calibrated. We present a systematic study of Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) applied to next-token prediction in transformer-based models with large vocabularies (greater than 250,000 tokens). Our central contribution is the identification of a coverage-efficiency tradeoff: while naive conformal prediction achieves valid coverage, it produces prediction sets of hundreds of tokens, rendering them uninformative. We propose Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP), a framework that leverages semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce the effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage. Experiments on Gemma-2B using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks demonstrate that VACP achieves 89.7 percent empirical coverage (90 percent target) while reducing the mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens -- a 197x improvement in efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis of vocabulary reduction and release our implementation for reproducibility.

### [20] [GHaLIB: A Multilingual Framework for Hope Speech Detection in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22705)
*Ahmed Abdullah,Sana Fatima,Haroon Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with focus on Urdu, using transformer models to achieve strong performance on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hope speech is underrepresented in NLP, especially for low-resource languages like Urdu. Current research focuses mainly on English, limiting tools for positive online communication. Transformer models have been effective for hate/offensive speech detection but haven't been sufficiently applied to hope speech across diverse linguistic settings.

Method: The authors use pretrained transformer models (XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, UrduBERT) with simple preprocessing to train classifiers for hope speech detection. They focus on Urdu but test across multiple languages including Spanish, German, and English.

Result: On the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark, the framework achieves F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with competitive results in Spanish, German, and English.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that existing multilingual models can be effectively implemented in low-resource environments for hope speech detection, facilitating identification of positive content and contributing to more constructive digital discourse.

Abstract: Hope speech has been relatively underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current studies are largely focused on English, which has resulted in a lack of resources for low-resource languages such as Urdu. As a result, the creation of tools that facilitate positive online communication remains limited. Although transformer-based architectures have proven to be effective in detecting hate and offensive speech, little has been done to apply them to hope speech or, more generally, to test them across a variety of linguistic settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with a focus on Urdu. Using pretrained transformer models such as XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, and UrduBERT, we apply simple preprocessing and train classifiers for improved results. Evaluations on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark demonstrate strong performance, achieving F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with similarly competitive results in Spanish, German, and English. These results highlight the possibility of implementing existing multilingual models in low-resource environments, thus making it easier to identify hope speech and helping to build a more constructive digital discourse.

*Anaelia Ovalle,Candace Ross,Sebastian Ruder,Adina Williams,Karen Ullrich,Mark Ibrahim,Levent Sagun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current multilingual LLMs show high task accuracy but their reasoning traces often don't logically support conclusions, especially in non-Latin scripts where misalignment is 2x worse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought prompting, it's unclear if this reasoning quality transfers across languages. Current multilingual evaluation may provide incomplete picture of true reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduced human-validated framework to evaluate if model-generated reasoning traces logically support conclusions across languages. Analyzed 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models. Developed error taxonomy through human annotation.

Result: Found critical blind spot: models achieve high task accuracy but reasoning often fails to support conclusions. Reasoning traces in non-Latin scripts show at least 2x more misalignment between reasoning and conclusions than Latin scripts. Failures stem primarily from evidential errors (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical reasoning steps.

Conclusion: Current multilingual evaluation practices provide incomplete picture of model reasoning capabilities. Need reasoning-aware evaluation frameworks that assess not just task accuracy but logical alignment between reasoning and conclusions, especially for non-Latin scripts.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought prompting, but whether this reasoning quality transfers across languages remains underexplored. We introduce a human-validated framework to evaluate whether model-generated reasoning traces logically support their conclusions across languages. Analyzing 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models, we uncover a critical blind spot: while models achieve high task accuracy, their reasoning can fail to support their conclusions. Reasoning traces in non-Latin scripts show at least twice as much misalignment between their reasoning and conclusions than those in Latin scripts. We develop an error taxonomy through human annotation to characterize these failures, finding they stem primarily from evidential errors (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical reasoning steps. Our findings demonstrate that current multilingual evaluation practices provide an incomplete picture of model reasoning capabilities and highlight the need for reasoning-aware evaluation frameworks.

### [22] [Mitigating Social Desirability Bias in Random Silicon Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22725)
*Sashank Chapala,Maksym Mironov,Songgaojun Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prompt-based framing controls, especially reformulated neutral phrasing, can mitigate Social Desirability Bias in LLM-based population simulations, improving alignment with real human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs used for "Silicon Sampling" (simulating population responses) exhibit Social Desirability Bias (SDB) where they give socially acceptable answers rather than realistic human responses. Existing research on mitigating this bias in LLM-based sampling is limited.

Method: Used American National Election Study (ANES) data with three LLMs (Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini). First replicated baseline silicon sampling to confirm SDB persistence. Then tested four prompt-based mitigation methods: reformulated (neutral, third-person phrasing), reverse-coded (semantic inversion), priming (encouraging analytics), and preamble (encouraging sincerity). Evaluated alignment using Jensen-Shannon Divergence with bootstrap confidence intervals.

Result: Reformulated prompts most effectively improved alignment by reducing concentration on socially acceptable answers and achieving distributions closer to ANES. Reverse-coding produced mixed results. Priming and Preamble encouraged response uniformity but showed no systematic benefit for bias mitigation.

Conclusion: Prompt-based framing controls, particularly reformulated neutral phrasing, effectively mitigate inherent Social Desirability Bias in LLMs, providing a practical approach for more representative silicon samples in population simulations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate population responses, a method known as ``Silicon Sampling''. However, responses to socially sensitive questions frequently exhibit Social Desirability Bias (SDB), diverging from real human data toward socially acceptable answers. Existing studies on social desirability bias in LLM-based sampling remain limited. In this work, we investigate whether minimal, psychologically grounded prompt wording can mitigate this bias and improve alignment between silicon and human samples. We conducted a study using data from the American National Election Study (ANES) on three LLMs from two model families: the open-source Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini. We first replicate a baseline silicon sampling study, confirming the persistent Social Desirability Bias. We then test four prompt-based mitigation methods: \emph{reformulated} (neutral, third-person phrasing), \emph{reverse-coded} (semantic inversion), and two meta-instructions, \emph{priming} and \emph{preamble}, respectively encouraging analytics and sincerity. Alignment with ANES is evaluated using Jensen-Shannon Divergence with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results demonstrate that reformulated prompts most effectively improve alignment by reducing distribution concentration on socially acceptable answers and achieving distributions closer to ANES. Reverse-coding produced mixed results across eligible items, while the Priming and Preamble encouraged response uniformity and showed no systematic benefit for bias mitigation. Our findings validate the efficacy of prompt-based framing controls in mitigating inherent Social Desirability Bias in LLMs, providing a practical path toward more representative silicon samples.

*Md Badsha Biswas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using social media data (especially Twitter) to enhance datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes, developing an NLP pipeline to identify and categorize women's pregnancy experiences from online posts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infant mortality remains a significant public health concern in the US, with birth defects as a leading cause. There's a need for more comprehensive research and intervention strategies for negative pregnancy outcomes (miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, premature birth). Current datasets are limited, and social media offers a novel data source.

Method: The paper introduces an NLP pipeline to process publicly available social media data (particularly Twitter). It uses robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies to handle challenges like imbalance, noise, and lack of structure. The system automatically identifies women sharing pregnancy experiences and categorizes them: positive cases (full gestation, normal birth weight) vs. negative cases (negative pregnancy outcomes).

Result: The research demonstrates the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource for epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes. It provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups, with potential applications in assessing causal impacts of interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures.

Conclusion: Social media data can effectively supplement traditional datasets for studying pregnancy outcomes. The proposed NLP approach offers a scalable method to identify pregnancy experiences and outcomes from online discourse, potentially enhancing public health research and intervention strategies for maternal and fetal health.

Abstract: Infant mortality remains a significant public health concern in the United States, with birth defects identified as a leading cause. Despite ongoing efforts to understand the causes of negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, and premature birth, there is still a need for more comprehensive research and strategies for intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses publicly available social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter, to enhance current datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research. The inherent challenges in utilizing social media data, including imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, necessitate robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies. By constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, we aim to automatically identify women sharing their pregnancy experiences, categorizing them based on reported outcomes. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight will be classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative pregnancy outcomes will be identified as negative cases. Furthermore, this study offers potential applications in assessing the causal impact of specific interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additionally, it provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups. In a broader context, our research showcases the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource in epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes.

### [24] [WeDLM: Reconciling Diffusion Language Models with Standard Causal Attention for Fast Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22737)
*Aiwei Liu,Minghua He,Shaoxun Zeng,Sijun Zhang,Linhao Zhang,Chuhan Wu,Wei Jia,Yuan Liu,Xiao Zhou,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WeDLM is a diffusion decoding framework that uses causal attention to enable prefix caching for parallel generation, achieving 3-10x speedups over optimized AR engines like vLLM while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive (AR) generation in LLMs is slow due to token-by-token sequential decoding. While Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding, they often fail to achieve speed gains in practice because they use bidirectional attention that breaks prefix KV caching, forcing repeated contextualization and undermining efficiency.

Method: WeDLM uses standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. It employs Topological Reordering to move observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions, allowing each masked position to condition on all observed tokens while maintaining a strict causal mask. A streaming decoding procedure continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix and maintains fixed parallel workload, avoiding stop-and-wait behavior.

Result: WeDLM preserves the quality of strong AR backbones while delivering substantial speedups: approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes. Comparisons against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings show diffusion-style decoding can outperform optimized AR engines in practice.

Conclusion: WeDLM demonstrates that diffusion-style decoding with causal attention and proper prefix caching can achieve significant speed improvements over optimized AR engines while maintaining generation quality, making parallel generation practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) generation is the standard decoding paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), but its token-by-token nature limits parallelism at inference time. Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding by recovering multiple masked tokens per step; however, in practice they often fail to translate this parallelism into deployment speed gains over optimized AR engines (e.g., vLLM). A key reason is that many DLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which breaks standard prefix KV caching and forces repeated contextualization, undermining efficiency. We propose WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework built entirely on standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. The core idea is to let each masked position condition on all currently observed tokens while keeping a strict causal mask, achieved by Topological Reordering that moves observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions. Building on this property, we introduce a streaming decoding procedure that continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix and maintains a fixed parallel workload, avoiding the stop-and-wait behavior common in block diffusion methods. Experiments show that WeDLM preserves the quality of strong AR backbones while delivering substantial speedups, approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes; critically, our comparisons are against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings, demonstrating that diffusion-style decoding can outperform an optimized AR engine in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-domain LLMs struggle with biomedical NER due to lack of domain knowledge and performance degradation from low-quality training data. There's a need for efficient fine-tuning methods that prioritize data quality over quantity.

Method: BioSelectTune reformulates BioNER as structured JSON generation and uses Hybrid Superfiltering - a weak-to-strong data curation method where a homologous weak model distills a compact, high-impact training dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple BioNER benchmarks. The model trained on only 50% of curated positive data surpasses fully-trained baselines and outperforms domain-specialized models like BioMedBERT.

Conclusion: BioSelectTune demonstrates that prioritizing data quality through intelligent curation enables highly efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for biomedical tasks, achieving superior performance with significantly less training data.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER) is a foundational task in medical informatics, crucial for downstream applications like drug discovery and clinical trial matching. However, adapting general-domain Large Language Models (LLMs) to this task is often hampered by their lack of domain-specific knowledge and the performance degradation caused by low-quality training data. To address these challenges, we introduce BioSelectTune, a highly efficient, data-centric framework for fine-tuning LLMs that prioritizes data quality over quantity. Methods and Results: BioSelectTune reformulates BioNER as a structured JSON generation task and leverages our novel Hybrid Superfiltering strategy, a weak-to-strong data curation method that uses a homologous weak model to distill a compact, high-impact training dataset. Conclusions: Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BioSelectTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple BioNER benchmarks. Notably, our model, trained on only 50% of the curated positive data, not only surpasses the fully-trained baseline but also outperforms powerful domain-specialized models like BioMedBERT.

*Dongning Rao,Yunbiao Zeng,Zhihua Jiang,Jujian Lv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TEXT model improves Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis by using MLLM-generated explanations and temporal alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance across four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MSA approaches underutilize explanations and temporal alignments between modalities, limiting their ability to capture subtle emotions in human-interaction applications.

Method: Uses MLLMs to generate explanations, aligns audio/video representations via temporality-oriented neural network (Mamba + temporal cross-attention), and implements text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts with gate fusion.

Result: Achieves best performance across four datasets, outperforming three recent approaches and three MLLMs. Wins on at least 4 out of 6 metrics. Reduces MAE to 0.353 on CH-SIMS (13.5% improvement).

Conclusion: TEXT successfully integrates explanations and temporal alignment to enhance MSA performance, demonstrating the value of these underexplored components in multi-modal sentiment analysis.

Abstract: Human-interaction-involved applications underscore the need for Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). Although many approaches have been proposed to address the subtle emotions in different modalities, the power of explanations and temporal alignments is still underexplored. Thus, this paper proposes the Text-routed sparse mixture-of-Experts model with eXplanation and Temporal alignment for MSA (TEXT). TEXT first augments explanations for MSA via Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM), and then novelly aligns the epresentations of audio and video through a temporality-oriented neural network block. TEXT aligns different modalities with explanations and facilitates a new text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts with gate fusion. Our temporal alignment block merges the benefits of Mamba and temporal cross-attention. As a result, TEXT achieves the best performance cross four datasets among all tested models, including three recently proposed approaches and three MLLMs. TEXT wins on at least four metrics out of all six metrics. For example, TEXT decreases the mean absolute error to 0.353 on the CH-SIMS dataset, which signifies a 13.5% decrement compared with recently proposed approaches.

### [27] [Fake News Classification in Urdu: A Domain Adaptation Approach for a Low-Resource Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22778)
*Muhammad Zain Ali,Bernhard Pfahringer,Tony Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain adaptation before fine-tuning improves fake news detection in Urdu for XLM-RoBERTa but shows mixed results for mBERT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu, as a low-resource language, has received limited attention in misinformation detection research. While multilingual pretrained models can be fine-tuned for this task, they struggle with domain-specific terms, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The paper investigates domain adaptation before fine-tuning using a staged training approach. Two multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT) are evaluated with domain-adaptive pretraining on a publicly available Urdu news corpus, then fine-tuned for fake news classification on four Urdu datasets.

Result: Domain-adapted XLM-RoBERTa consistently outperforms its vanilla counterpart across all four Urdu fake news datasets. Domain-adapted mBERT shows mixed results compared to its vanilla version.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation before fine-tuning is effective for improving fake news detection in low-resource languages like Urdu, particularly for XLM-RoBERTa, demonstrating the value of staged training approaches for optimizing model generalization.

Abstract: Misinformation on social media is a widely acknowledged issue, and researchers worldwide are actively engaged in its detection. However, low-resource languages such as Urdu have received limited attention in this domain. An obvious approach is to utilize a multilingual pretrained language model and fine-tune it for a downstream classification task, such as misinformation detection. However, these models struggle with domain-specific terms, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of domain adaptation before fine-tuning for fake news classification in Urdu, employing a staged training approach to optimize model generalization. We evaluate two widely used multilingual models, XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT, and apply domain-adaptive pretraining using a publicly available Urdu news corpus. Experiments on four publicly available Urdu fake news datasets show that domain-adapted XLM-R consistently outperforms its vanilla counterpart, while domain-adapted mBERT exhibits mixed results.

### [28] [CNSight: Evaluation of Clinical Note Segmentation Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22795)
*Risha Surana,Adrian Law,Sunwoo Kim,Rishab Sridhar,Angxiao Han,Peiyu Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates different methods for segmenting clinical notes into sections, comparing rule-based approaches, domain-specific transformers, and large language models on a dataset of 1,000 MIMIC-IV notes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes are typically unstructured or semi-structured after extraction from EMR systems, making them difficult to use for secondary analysis and downstream applications. Reliable section boundary identification is crucial for structuring these notes since different sections (like history of present illness, medications, discharge instructions) provide distinct clinical contexts.

Method: The study evaluates three categories of methods: 1) rule-based baselines, 2) domain-specific transformer models, and 3) large language models. They use a curated dataset of 1,000 clinical notes from MIMIC-IV and test performance on both sentence-level and freetext segmentation tasks.

Result: Large API-based models achieved the best overall performance, with GPT-5-mini reaching the highest average F1 score of 72.4 across both sentence-level and freetext segmentation. Lightweight baselines performed competitively on structured sentence-level tasks but struggled with unstructured freetext segmentation.

Conclusion: The results provide practical guidance for method selection in clinical note segmentation and establish a foundation for downstream tasks including information extraction, cohort identification, and automated summarization.

Abstract: Clinical notes are often stored in unstructured or semi-structured formats after extraction from electronic medical record (EMR) systems, which complicates their use for secondary analysis and downstream clinical applications. Reliable identification of section boundaries is a key step toward structuring these notes, as sections such as history of present illness, medications, and discharge instructions each provide distinct clinical contexts. In this work, we evaluate rule-based baselines, domain-specific transformer models, and large language models for clinical note segmentation using a curated dataset of 1,000 notes from MIMIC-IV. Our experiments show that large API-based models achieve the best overall performance, with GPT-5-mini reaching a best average F1 of 72.4 across sentence-level and freetext segmentation. Lightweight baselines remain competitive on structured sentence-level tasks but falter on unstructured freetext. Our results provide guidance for method selection and lay the groundwork for downstream tasks such as information extraction, cohort identification, and automated summarization.

*Sameer Sitoula,Tej Bahadur Shahi,Laxmi Prasad Bhatt,Anisha Pokhrel,Arjun Neupane*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NepEMO: A novel multi-label emotion and sentiment classification dataset for Nepali Reddit posts with 4,462 annotated posts covering 5 emotions and 3 sentiment classes, showing transformer models outperform traditional ML/DL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms like Reddit provide unique anonymous spaces for expressing sensitive personal experiences, especially during challenging events. There's a need for emotion and sentiment analysis datasets for Nepali language content to understand user experiences and emotions in this context.

Method: Created NepEMO dataset with 4,462 manually annotated Reddit posts (Jan 2019-Jun 2025) in English, Romanized Nepali, and Devanagari script. Performed linguistic analysis including emotion trends, emotion co-occurrence, sentiment-specific n-grams, and topic modeling using LDA and TF-IDF. Compared traditional ML, DL, and transformer models for multi-label emotion and sentiment classification tasks.

Result: Transformer models consistently outperformed both traditional machine learning and deep learning models for both multi-label emotion classification and sentiment classification tasks on the NepEMO dataset.

Conclusion: The NepEMO dataset provides valuable resource for emotion and sentiment analysis in Nepali social media content, demonstrating the superiority of transformer models for these NLP tasks in multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Social media (SM) platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit) are increasingly leveraged to share opinions and emotions, specifically during challenging events, such as natural disasters, pandemics, and political elections, and joyful occasions like festivals and celebrations. Among the SM platforms, Reddit provides a unique space for its users to anonymously express their experiences and thoughts on sensitive issues such as health and daily life. In this work, we present a novel dataset, called NepEMO, for multi-label emotion (MLE) and sentiment classification (SC) on the Nepali subreddit post. We curate and build a manually annotated dataset of 4,462 posts (January 2019- June 2025) written in English, Romanised Nepali and Devanagari script for five emotions (fear, anger, sadness, joy, and depression) and three sentiment classes (positive, negative, and neutral). We perform a detailed analysis of posts to capture linguistic insights, including emotion trends, co-occurrence of emotions, sentiment-specific n-grams, and topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and TF-IDF keyword extraction. Finally, we compare various traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and transformer models for MLE and SC tasks. The result shows that transformer models consistently outperform the ML and DL models for both tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes automated pipeline for synthesizing high-difficulty simulated environments and environment-level RL algorithm to improve agent training stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous RL in simulated environments has limitations: semi-automated environment synthesis, insufficient task difficulty, unstable simulated users, and environmental heterogeneity that challenge agentic RL.

Method: Two main contributions: (1) unified pipeline for automated and scalable synthesis of simulated environments with high-difficulty but easily verifiable tasks; (2) environment-level RL algorithm that mitigates user instability and performs advantage estimation at environment level.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on agentic benchmarks (tau-bench, tau2-Bench, VitaBench) validate effectiveness. Further analyses show strong out-of-domain generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses limitations of previous work by providing automated environment synthesis and stable RL training, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple benchmarks and showing good generalization.

Abstract: Conducting reinforcement learning (RL) in simulated environments offers a cost-effective and highly scalable way to enhance language-based agents. However, previous work has been limited to semi-automated environment synthesis or tasks lacking sufficient difficulty, offering little breadth or depth. In addition, the instability of simulated users integrated into these environments, along with the heterogeneity across simulated environments, poses further challenges for agentic RL. In this work, we propose: (1) a unified pipeline for automated and scalable synthesis of simulated environments associated with high-difficulty but easily verifiable tasks; and (2) an environment level RL algorithm that not only effectively mitigates user instability but also performs advantage estimation at the environment level, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. Comprehensive evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and VitaBench, validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Further in-depth analyses underscore its out-of-domain generalization.

*Haoyuan Wu,Hai Wang,Jiajia Wu,Jinxiang Ou,Keyao Wang,Weile Chen,Zihao Zheng,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new pre-training method that adapts RL principles to supervised learning to create better exploration spaces for subsequent RL training of LLMs, finding that precision-oriented priors work better than high-entropy distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of RL training for improving LLM reasoning depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. Current cross-entropy loss may not provide optimal exploration spaces for subsequent RL training.

Method: The authors reinterpret cross-entropy loss as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization in single-step episodes. They propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning, framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process. Their method uses reward-shaping with positive reward scaling to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically.

Result: Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, the authors find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance.

Conclusion: By systematically reshaping pre-trained token-output distributions using RL-inspired methods, researchers can create more favorable exploration spaces for subsequent RL training, leading to improved reasoning abilities in LLMs. The optimal exploration space appears to be precision-oriented rather than high-entropy.

Abstract: Recent advancements have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode. To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning. By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision. Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.

*Mengdi Chai,Ali R. Zomorrodi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show variable performance across clinical decision tasks; prompt engineering helps some tasks but hurts others; targeted few-shot learning doesn't consistently beat random examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show promise in medical knowledge assessments, their practical utility in real-world clinical decision-making remains underexplored, particularly across the entire clinical reasoning workflow.

Method: Evaluated ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and LIama 3.3 70B on 36 case studies across five clinical decision tasks under two temperature settings, then applied MedPrompt framework variations with targeted/random dynamic few-shot learning.

Result: Models showed high task variability: near-perfect accuracy in final diagnosis, poor performance in diagnostic testing, moderate elsewhere. Temperature effects varied by model. Prompt engineering improved lowest-performing task but hurt others. Targeted few-shot didn't consistently beat random selection.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering impact is highly model and task-dependent, requiring tailored, context-aware strategies for healthcare integration rather than one-size-fits-all approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in medical knowledge assessments, yet their practical utility in real-world clinical decision-making remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs-ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and LIama 3.3 70B-in clinical decision support across the entire clinical reasoning workflow of a typical patient encounter. Using 36 case studies, we first assessed LLM's out-of-the-box performance across five key sequential clinical decision-making tasks under two temperature settings (default vs. zero): differential diagnosis, essential immediate steps, relevant diagnostic testing, final diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. All models showed high variability by task, achieving near-perfect accuracy in final diagnosis, poor performance in relevant diagnostic testing, and moderate performance in remaining tasks. Furthermore, ChatGPT performed better under the zero temperature, whereas LIama showed stronger performance under the default temperature. Next, we assessed whether prompt engineering could enhance LLM performance by applying variations of the MedPrompt framework, incorporating targeted and random dynamic few-shot learning. The results demonstrate that prompt engineering is not a one-size-fit-all solution. While it significantly improved the performance on the task with lowest baseline accuracy (relevant diagnostic testing), it was counterproductive for others. Another key finding was that the targeted dynamic few-shot prompting did not consistently outperform random selection, indicating that the presumed benefits of closely matched examples may be counterbalanced by loss of broader contextual diversity. These findings suggest that the impact of prompt engineering is highly model and task-dependent, highlighting the need for tailored, context-aware strategies for integrating LLMs into healthcare.

### [33] [Improving Generalization in LLM Structured Pruning via Function-Aware Neuron Grouping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23014)
*Tao Yu,Yongqi An,Kuan Zhu,Guibo Zhu,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FANG is a post-training pruning framework that groups neurons by function, weights importance based on semantic context, and adaptively allocates sparsity to improve downstream task generalization while maintaining language modeling performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-training pruning methods suffer from limited generalization to downstream tasks when few-shot calibration sets fail to adequately reflect the pretraining data distribution, creating calibration bias.

Method: Function-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG) identifies and preserves neurons critical to specific functions by: 1) grouping neurons with similar function based on semantic context types, 2) weighting tokens that correlate with functional roles during importance estimation, 3) preserving neurons contributing across multiple context types, and 4) adaptively allocating sparsity based on functional complexity.

Result: FANG improves downstream accuracy while preserving language modeling performance, achieving SOTA results when combined with FLAP and OBC. It outperforms FLAP and OBC by 1.5%--8.5% in average accuracy under 30% and 40% sparsity.

Conclusion: FANG effectively addresses calibration bias in post-training pruning by employing function-aware neuron grouping and adaptive sparsity allocation, leading to better generalization to downstream tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance across natural language tasks but incur substantial computational and storage costs due to their scale. Post-training structured pruning offers an efficient solution. However, when few-shot calibration sets fail to adequately reflect the pretraining data distribution, existing methods exhibit limited generalization to downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose Function-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG), a post-training pruning framework that alleviates calibration bias by identifying and preserving neurons critical to specific function. FANG groups neurons with similar function based on the type of semantic context they process and prunes each group independently. During importance estimation within each group, tokens that strongly correlate with the functional role of the neuron group are given higher weighting. Additionally, FANG also preserves neurons that contribute across multiple context types. To achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance, it allocates sparsity to each block adaptively based on its functional complexity. Experiments show that FANG improves downstream accuracy while preserving language modeling performance. It achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results when combined with FLAP and OBC, two representative pruning methods. Specifically, FANG outperforms FLAP and OBC by 1.5%--8.5% in average accuracy under 30% and 40% sparsity.

*Wenxuan Xu,Arvind Pillai,Subigya Nepal,Amanda C Collins,Daniel M Mackin,Michael V Heinz,Tess Z Griffin,Nicholas C Jacobson,Andrew Campbell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LENS is a framework that aligns multimodal health sensing data with language models to generate clinically meaningful mental health narratives from sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs cannot natively process long-duration sensor streams, and there's a scarcity of paired sensor-text datasets for mental health applications, making it difficult to translate numerical time-series measurements into natural language narratives for clinical use.

Method: 1) Constructed large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses into natural-language descriptions (100k+ sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants). 2) Trained a patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into LLM's representation space for native time-series integration.

Result: LENS outperforms strong baselines on standard NLP metrics and task-specific symptom-severity accuracy measures. User study with 13 mental-health professionals indicates LENS-produced narratives are comprehensive and clinically meaningful.

Conclusion: The approach advances LLMs as interfaces for health sensing, providing a scalable path toward models that can reason over raw behavioral signals and support downstream clinical decision-making in mental health.

Abstract: Multimodal health sensing offers rich behavioral signals for assessing mental health, yet translating these numerical time-series measurements into natural language remains challenging. Current LLMs cannot natively ingest long-duration sensor streams, and paired sensor-text datasets are scarce. To address these challenges, we introduce LENS, a framework that aligns multimodal sensing data with language models to generate clinically grounded mental-health narratives. LENS first constructs a large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses related to depression and anxiety symptoms into natural-language descriptions, yielding over 100,000 sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants. To enable native time-series integration, we train a patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into an LLM's representation space. Our results show that LENS outperforms strong baselines on standard NLP metrics and task-specific measures of symptom-severity accuracy. A user study with 13 mental-health professionals further indicates that LENS-produced narratives are comprehensive and clinically meaningful. Ultimately, our approach advances LLMs as interfaces for health sensing, providing a scalable path toward models that can reason over raw behavioral signals and support downstream clinical decision-making.

### [35] [Is Chain-of-Thought Really Not Explainability? Chain-of-Thought Can Be Faithful without Hint Verbalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23032)
*Kerem Zaman,Shashank Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the Biasing Features metric for labeling CoT reasoning as unfaithful when it omits prompt-injected hints, arguing this confuses unfaithfulness with necessary incompleteness in compressing transformer computation into natural language narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the validity of the Biasing Features metric for evaluating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) faithfulness, which labels CoTs as unfaithful when they omit prompt-injected hints that affected predictions, potentially mischaracterizing necessary compression as unfaithfulness.

Method: 1) Compare Biasing Features metric with other faithfulness metrics on multi-hop reasoning tasks using Llama-3 and Gemma-3 models; 2) Introduce faithful@k metric to measure hint verbalization with varying token budgets; 3) Apply Causal Mediation Analysis to examine how non-verbalized hints causally mediate prediction changes through CoTs.

Result: Many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics (exceeding 50% in some models). Larger token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings). Causal Mediation Analysis shows non-verbalized hints can still causally mediate prediction changes through CoTs.

Conclusion: The paper cautions against relying solely on hint-based evaluations for CoT faithfulness and advocates for a broader interpretability toolkit that includes causal mediation analysis and corruption-based metrics, recognizing that apparent unfaithfulness may stem from token budget limitations rather than actual unfaithfulness.

Abstract: Recent work, using the Biasing Features metric, labels a CoT as unfaithful if it omits a prompt-injected hint that affected the prediction. We argue this metric confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness, the lossy compression needed to turn distributed transformer computation into a linear natural language narrative. On multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics, exceeding 50% in some models. With a new faithful@k metric, we show that larger inference-time token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings), suggesting much apparent unfaithfulness is due to tight token limits. Using Causal Mediation Analysis, we further show that even non-verbalized hints can causally mediate prediction changes through the CoT. We therefore caution against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and advocate a broader interpretability toolkit, including causal mediation and corruption-based metrics.

TL;DR: Prompt Choreography: A framework for efficient LLM workflow execution using dynamic global KV cache to reduce redundant computation and improve latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent workflows, but current approaches suffer from redundant computation and high latency due to repeated encoding of messages across different contexts.

Method: Introduces Prompt Choreography framework with dynamic global KV cache that allows LLM calls to attend to arbitrary subsets of previously encoded messages, supports parallel calls, and uses fine-tuning to help LLMs work effectively with cached encodings.

Result: Achieves 2.0-6.2× faster time-to-first-token (per-message latency) and >2.2× end-to-end speedups in workflows dominated by redundant computation.

Conclusion: Prompt Choreography significantly improves LLM workflow efficiency by reducing redundant computation through intelligent caching, making multi-agent LLM deployments more practical and scalable.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent workflows. We introduce Prompt Choreography, a framework that efficiently executes LLM workflows by maintaining a dynamic, global KV cache. Each LLM call can attend to an arbitrary, reordered subset of previously encoded messages. Parallel calls are supported. Though caching messages' encodings sometimes gives different results from re-encoding them in a new context, we show in diverse settings that fine-tuning the LLM to work with the cache can help it mimic the original results. Prompt Choreography significantly reduces per-message latency (2.0--6.2$\times$ faster time-to-first-token) and achieves substantial end-to-end speedups ($>$2.2$\times$) in some workflows dominated by redundant computation.

TL;DR: TabiBERT is a new monolingual Turkish encoder Transformer trained from scratch using modern architectural improvements (RoPE, FlashAttention) on 1 trillion tokens from a diverse 84.88B token corpus, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Turkish NLP tasks with better efficiency and longer context support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch with modern architectural advancements like Rotary Positional Embeddings, FlashAttention, and refined normalization that have improved computational efficiency, training stability, and long-context modeling in encoder-only Transformers since BERT.

Method: Developed TabiBERT based on ModernBERT architecture with RoPE, FlashAttention, and refined normalization.

Result: TabiBERT supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, reduces GPU memory consumption. Scores 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points, establishes SOTA on 5 of 8 categories including question answering (+9.55), code retrieval (+2.41), document retrieval (+0.60). Achieves +1.47 average improvement over task-specific prior best results.

Conclusion: TabiBERT demonstrates robust cross-domain generalization and establishes new state-of-the-art for Turkish NLP while providing improved efficiency and longer context support. The release of model weights, training configurations, and evaluation code enables transparent, reproducible research for Turkish encoder development.

Abstract: Since the inception of BERT, encoder-only Transformers have evolved significantly in computational efficiency, training stability, and long-context modeling. ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture trained from scratch on a large, curated corpus. TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). The model supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging. TabiBERT attains 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points and establishing state-of-the-art on five of eight categories: question answering (+9.55), code retrieval (+2.41), and document retrieval (+0.60). Compared with task-specific prior best results, including specialized models like TurkishBERTweet, TabiBERT achieves +1.47 average improvement, indicating robust cross-domain generalization. We release model weights, training configurations, and evaluation code for transparent, reproducible Turkish encoder research.

TL;DR: Proposes a matrix multiplication-free language model with reservoir computing layers to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have high computational costs that limit their efficiency, so the authors aim to create more computationally efficient models without sacrificing performance.

Method: Uses a MatMul-free language model architecture with partially fixed/shared weights, inserts reservoir computing layers for rich dynamic representations, and combines operations to reduce memory accesses.

Result: Reduces parameters by up to 19%, training time by 9.9%, and inference time by 8.0% while maintaining comparable performance to baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully reduces computational costs of language models through reservoir computing and weight sharing strategies, offering a promising direction for more efficient LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing; however, their high computational cost remains a major bottleneck. In this study, we target computational efficiency by focusing on a matrix multiplication free language model (MatMul-free LM) and further reducing the training cost through an architecture inspired by reservoir computing. Specifically, we partially fix and share the weights of selected layers in the MatMul-free LM and insert reservoir layers to obtain rich dynamic representations without additional training overhead. Additionally, several operations are combined to reduce memory accesses. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture reduces the number of parameters by up to 19%, training time by 9.9%, and inference time by 8.0%, while maintaining comparable performance to the baseline model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BiomedTLDR, a dataset of researcher-authored scientific summaries, and evaluates LLMs' ability to generate TLDRs from abstracts, finding they tend to be more extractive than human summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of comprehensive, high-quality scientific TLDR datasets hinders both development and evaluation of LLMs' summarization capabilities, and there's a need to understand how LLM-generated summaries differ from human expert summaries.

Method: Created BiomedTLDR dataset using researcher-authored summaries from scientific papers (leveraging authors' comments in bibliographies), then tested popular open-weight LLMs for generating TLDRs based on paper abstracts.

Result: While some LLMs successfully produce human-like summaries, they generally show greater affinity for original text's lexical choices and rhetorical structures, making them more extractive rather than abstractive compared to human summaries.

Conclusion: The BiomedTLDR dataset enables better evaluation of LLM summarization capabilities, revealing that current LLMs tend to produce more extractive summaries than the abstractive summaries created by human experts.

Abstract: High-quality scientific extreme summary (TLDR) facilitates effective science communication. How do large language models (LLMs) perform in generating them? How are LLM-generated summaries different from those written by human experts? However, the lack of a comprehensive, high-quality scientific TLDR dataset hinders both the development and evaluation of LLMs' summarization ability. To address these, we propose a novel dataset, BiomedTLDR, containing a large sample of researcher-authored summaries from scientific papers, which leverages the common practice of including authors' comments alongside bibliography items. We then test popular open-weight LLMs for generating TLDRs based on abstracts. Our analysis reveals that, although some of them successfully produce humanoid summaries, LLMs generally exhibit a greater affinity for the original text's lexical choices and rhetorical structures, hence tend to be more extractive rather than abstractive in general, compared to humans. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/netknowledge/LLM_summarization (Lyu and Ke, 2025).

Motivation: To leverage the collective wisdom of multiple LLMs with diverse strengths by creating an interpretable, unsupervised ensemble method that can adapt flexibly without requiring labeled data.

Method: Three-stage peer-review framework: 1) Scoring using LLM-as-a-Judge technique with multiple LLMs evaluating each response, 2) Reasoning with graphical model-based truth inference or averaging to aggregate scores, 3) Selection of highest-scoring response as ensemble output.

Result: Strong performance across four datasets, with two variants outperforming the recent advanced model Smoothie-Global by 6.9% and 7.3% points respectively.

Conclusion: LLM-PeerReview provides a simple yet powerful unsupervised ensemble approach that effectively combines multiple LLMs' strengths through an interpretable peer-review mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: We propose LLM-PeerReview, an unsupervised LLM Ensemble method that selects the most ideal response from multiple LLM-generated candidates for each query, harnessing the collective wisdom of multiple models with diverse strengths. LLM-PeerReview is built on a novel, peer-review-inspired framework that offers a clear and interpretable mechanism, while remaining fully unsupervised for flexible adaptability and generalization. Specifically, it operates in three stages: For scoring, we use the emerging LLM-as-a-Judge technique to evaluate each response by reusing multiple LLMs at hand; For reasoning, we can apply a principled graphical model-based truth inference algorithm or a straightforward averaging strategy to aggregate multiple scores to produce a final score for each response; Finally, the highest-scoring response is selected as the best ensemble output. LLM-PeerReview is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. The two variants of the proposed approach obtain strong results across four datasets, including outperforming the recent advanced model Smoothie-Global by 6.9% and 7.3% points, respectively.

Motivation: LLMs show systematic errors on complex, multi-step programming tasks due to the flexibility of general-purpose languages like Python, which allows multiple valid approaches and requires implicit state management, leading to ambiguity in code generation.

Method: Introduce Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) for data transformation pipelines with explicit, constrained syntax to reduce ambiguity. Evaluate LLMs (Claude 3.5 Haiku and GPT-4o-mini) on 100 benchmark problems using only in-context prompts, with zero prior training on Anka.

Result: Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy. Anka shows 40 percentage point advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%). Cross-validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms +26.7 percentage point advantage on multi-step tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts with near-native accuracy; constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and purposefully designed DSLs for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages despite extensive training on the latter.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, yet they exhibit systematic errors on complex, multi-step programming tasks. We hypothesize that these errors stem from the flexibility of general-purpose languages, which permits multiple valid approaches and requires implicit state management. To test this hypothesis, we introduce Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) for data transformation pipelines designed with explicit, constrained syntax that reduces ambiguity in code generation. Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training. We release the complete language implementation, benchmark suite, and evaluation framework to facilitate further research.

*Dianyun Wang,Qingsen Ma,Yuhu Shang,Zhifeng Lu,Lechen Ning,Zhenbo Xu,Huijia Wu,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAE-based interpretable low-rank adaptation method improves safety alignment performance while providing transparency into learned subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA operate as black boxes with no interpretability or direct control over learned subspaces, due to polysemanticity (entangled concepts in single dimensions).

Method: Leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in disentangled feature space, then construct explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization.

Result: Achieves up to 99.6% safety rate (exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points) while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters, approaching RLHF-based methods. Provides theoretical analysis showing SAE-based identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error under monosemanticity.

Conclusion: Incorporating mechanistic interpretability into fine-tuning can simultaneously improve both performance and transparency, demonstrating the value of interpretable subspaces for parameter-efficient adaptation.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has become the dominant paradigm for adapting large language models to downstream tasks. Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features. Our work demonstrates that incorporating mechanistic interpretability into the fine-tuning process can simultaneously improve both performance and transparency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LiveAMR, a new task for detecting pronunciation-based morph evasion in Chinese e-commerce live streams, particularly in health/medical domains, using LLM-enhanced text generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce live streaming hosts in China use pronunciation morphs to evade scrutiny while engaging in false advertising, especially in health/medical domains where regulation is critical but current methods focus on text-based evasion.

Method: Transformed the morph detection task into a text-to-text generation problem, constructed the first LiveAMR dataset with 86,790 samples, and leveraged large language models to generate additional training data for improved performance.

Result: Developed a method that significantly enhances live streaming regulation by detecting pronunciation-based morph evasion, demonstrating improved performance through LLM-generated training data.

Conclusion: LiveAMR effectively addresses the unique challenge of pronunciation-based evasion in live streaming, providing a valuable tool for regulating deceptive practices in e-commerce, particularly in sensitive health/medical domains.

Abstract: E-commerce live streaming in China, particularly on platforms like Douyin, has become a major sales channel, but hosts often use morphs to evade scrutiny and engage in false advertising. This study introduces the Live Auditory Morph Resolution (LiveAMR) task to detect such violations. Unlike previous morph research focused on text-based evasion in social media and underground industries, LiveAMR targets pronunciation-based evasion in health and medical live streams. We constructed the first LiveAMR dataset with 86,790 samples and developed a method to transform the task into a text-to-text generation problem. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate additional training data, we improved performance and demonstrated that morph resolution significantly enhances live streaming regulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of audiobook interpretations is time-consuming and resource-intensive, despite growing demand for accessible book analyses that provide practical insights and intellectual inspiration.

Method: Multi-agent collaboration system with 11 specialized agents (topic analysts, case analysts, editors, narrator, proofreaders) using LLMs and speech synthesis to explore themes, extract real-world cases, refine content organization, and synthesize natural spoken language.

Result: Generated interpretative scripts are simpler and more accurate compared to expert interpretations, though there's still a gap in speech generation quality.

Conclusion: AI4Reading demonstrates promising automation of audiobook interpretation creation with accurate content preservation, enhanced comprehensibility, and logical narrative structure, though speech synthesis quality needs improvement.

Abstract: Audiobook interpretations are attracting increasing attention, as they provide accessible and in-depth analyses of books that offer readers practical insights and intellectual inspiration. However, their manual creation process remains time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose AI4Reading, a multi-agent collaboration system leveraging large language models (LLMs) and speech synthesis technology to generate podcast, like audiobook interpretations. The system is designed to meet three key objectives: accurate content preservation, enhanced comprehensibility, and a logical narrative structure. To achieve these goals, we develop a framework composed of 11 specialized agents,including topic analysts, case analysts, editors, a narrator, and proofreaders that work in concert to explore themes, extract real world cases, refine content organization, and synthesize natural spoken language. By comparing expert interpretations with our system's output, the results show that although AI4Reading still has a gap in speech generation quality, the generated interpretative scripts are simpler and more accurate.

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey paper that bridges cognitive neuroscience memory mechanisms with LLM-driven autonomous agents, covering definitions, taxonomy, storage, management lifecycle, benchmarks, security, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous agent research struggles to assimilate human memory mechanisms due to interdisciplinary barriers. The paper aims to bridge cognitive neuroscience insights with LLM-driven agents to design more efficient memory workflows.

Method: Systematic synthesis of interdisciplinary knowledge: 1) Elucidates memory definition/function across cognitive neuroscience, LLMs, and agents; 2) Comparative analysis of memory taxonomy, storage, and management lifecycle; 3) Reviews evaluation benchmarks; 4) Explores memory security (attack/defense); 5) Envisions future research directions.

Result: Provides a comprehensive framework connecting biological and artificial memory systems, identifies current limitations in agent memory design, and establishes evaluation benchmarks and security considerations for memory systems.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a foundation for integrating human memory mechanisms into AI agents, with future directions focusing on multimodal memory systems and skill acquisition to enhance agent capabilities.

Abstract: Memory serves as the pivotal nexus bridging past and future, providing both humans and AI systems with invaluable concepts and experience to navigate complex tasks. Recent research on autonomous agents has increasingly focused on designing efficient memory workflows by drawing on cognitive neuroscience. However, constrained by interdisciplinary barriers, existing works struggle to assimilate the essence of human memory mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we systematically synthesizes interdisciplinary knowledge of memory, connecting insights from cognitive neuroscience with LLM-driven agents. Specifically, we first elucidate the definition and function of memory along a progressive trajectory from cognitive neuroscience through LLMs to agents. We then provide a comparative analysis of memory taxonomy, storage mechanisms, and the complete management lifecycle from both biological and artificial perspectives. Subsequently, we review the mainstream benchmarks for evaluating agent memory. Additionally, we explore memory security from dual perspectives of attack and defense. Finally, we envision future research directions, with a focus on multimodal memory systems and skill acquisition.

*Xin Zhang,Yang Cao,Baoxing Wu,Xinyi Chen,Kai Song,Siying Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGR: A stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs that uses external subgraph generation to improve logical inference and reduce noise in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges in deep reasoning and logical inference tasks, often incorporating noisy or irrelevant information from training data that leads to incorrect predictions and factual inconsistencies.

Method: Proposes SGR framework that dynamically constructs query-relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases, then guides LLMs to perform step-by-step reasoning over these structured subgraphs, integrating multiple reasoning paths for final answers.

Result: Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show SGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating effectiveness in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: SGR effectively addresses LLM limitations in complex reasoning by leveraging structured external knowledge through stepwise subgraph-guided reasoning, reducing noise and improving accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks in recent years, including machine translation, text generation, and question answering. As their applications extend to increasingly complex scenarios, however, LLMs continue to face challenges in tasks that require deep reasoning and logical inference. In particular, models trained on large scale textual corpora may incorporate noisy or irrelevant information during generation, which can lead to incorrect predictions or outputs that are inconsistent with factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs based on external subgraph generation, termed SGR. The proposed framework dynamically constructs query relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases and leverages their semantic structure to guide the reasoning process. By performing reasoning in a step by step manner over structured subgraphs, SGR reduces the influence of noisy information and improves reasoning accuracy. Specifically, the framework first generates an external subgraph tailored to the input query, then guides the model to conduct multi step reasoning grounded in the subgraph, and finally integrates multiple reasoning paths to produce the final answer. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

### [47] [Entropy-Guided Token Dropout: Training Autoregressive Language Models with Limited Domain Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23422)
*Jiapeng Wang,Yiwen Hu,Yanzipeng Gao,Haoyu Wang,Shuo Wang,Hongyu Lu,Jiaxin Mao,Wayne Xin Zhao,Junyi Li,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EntroDrop: An entropy-guided token dropout method that prevents performance degradation in multi-epoch LLM training by selectively masking low-entropy tokens and using curriculum scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-epoch training is necessary for adapting LLMs to domain-specific data, but autoregressive models suffer performance degradation from overfitting when repeatedly exposed to the same data. This degradation stems from an imbalance where low-entropy tokens dominate optimization while generalization on high-entropy tokens deteriorates.

Method: EntroDrop is an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. It selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength based on training progress.

Result: Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data, offering a promising pathway for more effective LLM adaptation in data-constrained domains.

Abstract: As access to high-quality, domain-specific data grows increasingly scarce, multi-epoch training has become a practical strategy for adapting large language models (LLMs). However, autoregressive models often suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure, where overfitting leads to a marked decline in model capability. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to an imbalance in learning dynamics: predictable, low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and come to dominate optimization, while the model's ability to generalize on high-entropy tokens deteriorates with continued training. To address this, we introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. EntroDrop selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength in alignment with training progress. Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training. These findings underscore the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data. Our approach offers a promising pathway toward more effective adaptation of LLMs in data-constrained domains.

### [48] [The Effect of Gender Diversity on Scientific Team Impact: A Team Roles Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23429)
*Yi Zhao,Yongjun Zhu,Donghun Kim,Yuzhuo Wang,Heng Zhang,Chao Lu,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gender diversity in scientific teams shows complex effects: inverted U-shaped relationship for both leadership and support roles, with all-female leadership plus all-male support performing best. Team size moderates leadership diversity effects but not support diversity effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research on gender diversity and team success has inconsistent findings and overlooks internal role differentiation (leadership vs. support roles), limiting understanding of how gender diversity actually shapes team impact in scientific collaborations.

Method: Analyzed 130,000+ PLOS papers (mostly biomedical) using author contribution statements to classify members into leadership and support roles. Used multivariable regression to examine gender diversity's association with team impact (5-year citations), plus threshold regression to study team size moderation.

Result: 1) Gender diversity shows inverted U-shaped relationship with team impact for both leadership and support groups. 2) Teams with all-female leadership and all-male support achieve highest impact. 3) Leadership diversity effect is negative for small teams but becomes positive/insignificant for large teams, while support diversity remains positive regardless of team size.

Conclusion: Gender diversity effects in scientific teams are nuanced and role-dependent. Leadership and support roles show different diversity patterns, with team size moderating leadership effects but not support effects. Optimal team composition appears to be all-female leadership combined with all-male support.

Abstract: The influence of gender diversity on the success of scientific teams is of great interest to academia. However, prior findings remain inconsistent, and most studies operationalize diversity in aggregate terms, overlooking internal role differentiation. This limitation obscures a more nuanced understanding of how gender diversity shapes team impact. In particular, the effect of gender diversity across different team roles remains poorly understood. To this end, we define a scientific team as all coauthors of a paper and measure team impact through five-year citation counts. Using author contribution statements, we classified members into leadership and support roles. Drawing on more than 130,000 papers from PLOS journals, most of which are in biomedical-related disciplines, we employed multivariable regression to examine the association between gender diversity in these roles and team impact. Furthermore, we apply a threshold regression model to investigate how team size moderates this relationship. The results show that (1) the relationship between gender diversity and team impact follows an inverted U-shape for both leadership and support groups; (2) teams with an all-female leadership group and an all-male support group achieve higher impact than other team types. Interestingly, (3) the effect of leadership-group gender diversity is significantly negative for small teams but becomes positive and statistically insignificant in large teams. In contrast, the estimates for support-group gender diversity remain significant and positive, regardless of team size.

*Xuan Feng,Bo An,Tianlong Gu,Liang Chang,Fengrui Hao,Peipeng Yu,Shuai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C2PO is a unified alignment framework that simultaneously mitigates both stereotypical and structural biases in LLMs by discovering and suppressing spurious feature correlations through causal counterfactual signals and fairness-sensitive preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to bias mitigation in LLMs typically address stereotypical biases (gender/racial stereotypes) and structural biases (lexical overlap/position preferences) in isolation, often improving one while worsening the other. There's a need for a unified framework that tackles both types of reasoning failures simultaneously.

Method: Causal-Contrastive Preference Optimization (C2PO) uses causal counterfactual signals to isolate bias-inducing features from valid reasoning paths, and employs a fairness-sensitive preference update mechanism to dynamically evaluate logit-level contributions and suppress shortcut features during optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show C2PO effectively mitigates both stereotypical bias (BBQ, Unqover) and structural bias (MNLI, HANS, Chatbot, MT-Bench), while maintaining out-of-domain fairness (StereoSet, WinoBias) and preserving general reasoning capabilities (MMLU, GSM8K).

Conclusion: C2PO provides a unified solution to address both stereotypical and structural biases in LLMs by targeting the root cause - spurious feature correlations - through causal reasoning and preference optimization, achieving balanced bias mitigation without sacrificing general utility.

Abstract: Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) poses significant risks to trustworthiness, manifesting primarily as stereotypical biases (e.g., gender or racial stereotypes) and structural biases (e.g., lexical overlap or position preferences). However, prior paradigms typically address these in isolation, often mitigating one at the expense of exacerbating the other. To address this, we conduct a systematic exploration of these reasoning failures and identify a primary inducement: the latent spurious feature correlations within the input that drive these erroneous reasoning shortcuts. Driven by these findings, we introduce Causal-Contrastive Preference Optimization (C2PO), a unified alignment framework designed to tackle these specific failures by simultaneously discovering and suppressing these correlations directly within the optimization process. Specifically, C2PO leverages causal counterfactual signals to isolate bias-inducing features from valid reasoning paths, and employs a fairness-sensitive preference update mechanism to dynamically evaluate logit-level contributions and suppress shortcut features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks covering stereotypical bias (BBQ, Unqover), structural bias (MNLI, HANS, Chatbot, MT-Bench), out-of-domain fairness (StereoSet, WinoBias), and general utility (MMLU, GSM8K) demonstrate that C2PO effectively mitigates stereotypical and structural biases while preserving robust general reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: ClinDEF is a dynamic framework for evaluating LLMs' clinical reasoning through simulated diagnostic dialogues, moving beyond static QA to assess interactive diagnostic processes with granular multi-level evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks focus on static question-answering and poorly represent the dynamic clinical-reasoning process of real doctor-patient interactions. Current dynamic medical frameworks rely on limited, contamination-prone datasets and lack granular, multi-level evaluation.

Method: ClinDEF uses a disease knowledge graph to dynamically generate patient cases and facilitates multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent. It includes fine-grained efficiency analysis and rubric-based assessment of diagnostic quality.

Result: Experiments show that ClinDEF effectively exposes critical clinical reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, offering a more nuanced and clinically meaningful evaluation paradigm.

Conclusion: ClinDEF provides a dynamic framework that better captures real-world clinical reasoning processes, offering superior evaluation of LLMs' diagnostic capabilities compared to static benchmarks.

Abstract: Clinical diagnosis begins with doctor-patient interaction, during which physicians iteratively gather information, determine examination and refine differential diagnosis through patients' response. This dynamic clinical-reasoning process is poorly represented by existing LLM benchmarks that focus on static question-answering. To mitigate these gaps, recent methods explore dynamic medical frameworks involving interactive clinical dialogues. Although effective, they often rely on limited, contamination-prone datasets and lack granular, multi-level evaluation. In this work, we propose ClinDEF, a dynamic framework for assessing clinical reasoning in LLMs through simulated diagnostic dialogues. Grounded in a disease knowledge graph, our method dynamically generates patient cases and facilitates multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent. Our evaluation protocol goes beyond diagnostic accuracy by incorporating fine-grained efficiency analysis and rubric-based assessment of diagnostic quality. Experiments show that ClinDEF effectively exposes critical clinical reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, offering a more nuanced and clinically meaningful evaluation paradigm.

*Ang Lv,Jin Ma,Yiyuan Ma,Siyuan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes ERC loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss for MoE models that couples router decisions with expert capabilities using proxy tokens and activation constraints, enabling efficient expert specialization without scaling with batch size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models lack explicit constraints to align router decisions with expert capabilities, limiting model performance. Current coupling methods are computationally expensive as they scale with the number of tokens.

Method: Introduces expert-router coupling (ERC) loss that treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token. Feeds perturbed router embeddings through experts and enforces two constraints: (1) each expert shows higher activation for its own proxy token than others, (2) each proxy token elicits stronger activation from its corresponding expert than others.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through pre-training MoE-LLMs from 3B to 15B parameters on trillions of tokens. ERC loss provides flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training.

Conclusion: ERC loss is a computationally efficient solution that ensures router embeddings faithfully represent expert capabilities while experts specialize in processing routed tokens, offering valuable insights into MoE behavior.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models lack explicit constraints to ensure the router's decisions align well with the experts' capabilities, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs.

*Thomas Haschka,Joseph Bakarji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A nested density clustering method for building hierarchical semantic trees from LLM embeddings, enabling data-driven discovery of research areas and subfields without predefined categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLM embeddings are widely used for semantic similarity search in vector databases, the global hierarchical semantic structure of text corpora often remains unclear and opaque. There's a need for methods that can automatically reveal hierarchical semantic relationships without predefined categories.

Method: A nested density clustering approach that starts by identifying dense clusters of semantically similar texts in LLM embedding space. As density criteria are gradually relaxed, dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, eventually forming a single root cluster. This process constructs a hierarchical tree structure capturing semantic relationships.

Result: The method successfully builds hierarchical semantic trees for scientific abstracts, enabling data-driven discovery of research areas and subfields. It demonstrates robustness across domains when applied to benchmark datasets like 20 Newsgroups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews.

Conclusion: Nested density trees provide a powerful approach for revealing hierarchical semantic structure in textual datasets, with applications in scientometrics, topic evolution analysis, and semantic structure discovery across various domains.

Abstract: Semantic text classification has undergone significant advances in recent years due to the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their high dimensional embeddings. While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster -- the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 Newsgroups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACT is a three-stage algorithm for detecting biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature that outperforms existing systems with F1 score of 0.91 by combining morphology-aware alignment with context-sensitive enrichment to handle short, paraphrased, and structurally embedded quotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text reuse frameworks struggle with detecting biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature due to challenges with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded quotations. There's a methodological gap between exhaustive machine-based detection and human editorial judgment in digital humanities and computational philology.

Method: ACT uses a three-stage algorithm: 1) morphology-aware alignment to handle morphological variations, 2) context-sensitive enrichment to identify complex citation patterns like "Wave" and "Echo" quotations, and 3) evaluation of different configurations (ACT-QE full pipeline, ACT-2 without stylistic enrichment, ACT-3 with longer n-grams).

Result: ACT-QE (full pipeline) achieves F1 score of 0.91 with Recall 0.89 and Precision 0.94, outperforming Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher, and human-annotated critical editions. ACT-2 has higher Recall (0.90) but lower Precision, while ACT-3 offers tradeoff between coverage and specificity.

Conclusion: ACT successfully addresses the methodological gap in quotation detection for morphologically rich and citation-dense traditions like Rabbinic literature. Beyond improved detection, it enables classification of stylistic patterns for genre classification and intertextual analysis, laying foundation for broader historical textual analysis applications.

Abstract: This paper presents ACT (Allocate Connections between Texts), a novel three-stage algorithm for the automatic detection of biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature. Unlike existing text reuse frameworks that struggle with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded quotations, ACT combines a morphology-aware alignment algorithm with a context-sensitive enrichment stage that identifies complex citation patterns such as "Wave" and "Echo" quotations.
  Our approach was evaluated against leading systems, including Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher, as well as human-annotated critical editions. We further assessed three ACT configurations to isolate the contribution of each component. Results demonstrate that the full ACT pipeline (ACT-QE) outperforms all baselines, achieving an F1 score of 0.91, with superior Recall (0.89) and Precision (0.94). Notably, ACT-2, which lacks stylistic enrichment, achieves higher Recall (0.90) but suffers in Precision, while ACT-3, using longer n-grams, offers a tradeoff between coverage and specificity.
  In addition to improving quotation detection, ACT's ability to classify stylistic patterns across corpora opens new avenues for genre classification and intertextual analysis. This work contributes to digital humanities and computational philology by addressing the methodological gap between exhaustive machine-based detection and human editorial judgment. ACT lays a foundation for broader applications in historical textual analysis, especially in morphologically rich and citation-dense traditions like Aggadic literature.

*Fengjiao Chen,Minhao Jing,Weitao Lu,Yan Feng,Xiaoyu Li,Xuezhi Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Vision-language models can improve visual understanding through semantic generation (not pixel generation) when trained at large scale (>200M samples).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether visual generation tasks can enhance visual understanding in unified vision-language models at large data scales, which remains under-explored.

Method: Proposes UniHetero, a concise unified model structure, and analyzes it under large-scale pretraining (>200M samples) to study the relationship between generation and understanding.

Result: Three key findings: (1) Generation improves understanding only when generating semantics, not pixels; (2) Generation shows superior data scaling trends and higher data utilization; (3) Autoregression on input embedding effectively captures visual details.

Conclusion: Semantic generation (rather than pixel generation) can enhance visual understanding in unified vision-language models, with benefits in data scaling and utilization, making autoregressive approaches on embeddings effective for visual detail capture.

Abstract: Vision-language large models are moving toward the unification of visual understanding and visual generation tasks. However, whether generation can enhance understanding is still under-explored on large data scale. In this work, we analysis the unified model with a concise structure, UniHetero, under large-scale pretraining (>200M samples). Our key observations are: (1) Generation can improve understanding, but Only if you generate Semantics, Not Pixels. (2) Generation reveals a superior Data Scaling trend and higher Data Utilization. (3) Autoregression on Input Embedding is effective to capture visual details.

### [55] [Single LLM Debate, MoLaCE: Mixture of Latent Concept Experts Against Confirmation Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23518)
*Hazel Kim,Philip Torr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoLaCE is a lightweight inference-time framework that reduces LLM confirmation bias by mixing experts as different activation strengths over latent concepts, enabling single models to emulate debate benefits internally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from input confirmation bias where they reinforce preferred answers in prompts rather than exploring alternatives. This is especially harmful in multi-agent debates where echo chambers amplify rather than correct bias.

Method: MoLaCE (Mixture of Latent Concept Experts) mixes experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. It leverages that differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways affecting factual correctness.

Result: Empirical results show MoLaCE consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate performance while requiring only a fraction of the computation.

Conclusion: MoLaCE enables single LLMs to emulate debate benefits internally, is computationally efficient and scalable, and can be integrated into multi-agent frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly vulnerable to input confirmation bias. When a prompt implies a preferred answer, models often reinforce that bias rather than explore alternatives. This phenomenon remains underexplored, yet it is already harmful in base models and poses an even greater risk in multi-agent debate, where echo chambers reinforce bias instead of correction. We introduce Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that addresses confirmation bias by mixing experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. Our key insight is that, due to the compositional nature of language, differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways that affect factual correctness, so no single fixed intervention can be applied universally across inputs. This design enables a single LLM to emulate the benefits of debate internally while remaining computationally efficient and scalable. It can also be integrated into multi-agent debate frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors. We empirically show that it consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate while requiring only a fraction of the computation.

### [56] [Lie to Me: Knowledge Graphs for Robust Hallucination Self-Detection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23547)
*Sahil Kale,Antonio Luca Alfeo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A simple yet effective method that converts LLM responses into knowledge graphs to improve hallucination self-detection, achieving up to 16% accuracy and 20% F1-score improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations (false but convincing statements) are a major barrier to safe LLM deployment. While self-detection methods show promise, there's room for improvement by leveraging structured knowledge representations.

Method: Two-step approach: (1) Convert LLM responses into knowledge graphs of entities and relations, (2) Use these graphs to estimate hallucination likelihood. The method is low-cost and model-agnostic, tested on GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash across two hallucination detection datasets.

Result: Achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT. Also releases an enhanced, manually curated hallucination detection dataset for better benchmarking.

Conclusion: LLMs can better analyze atomic facts when structured as knowledge graphs, even when initial outputs contain inaccuracies. This approach paves the way toward safer, more trustworthy language models through improved hallucination detection.

Abstract: Hallucinations, the generation of apparently convincing yet false statements, remain a major barrier to the safe deployment of LLMs. Building on the strong performance of self-detection methods, we examine the use of structured knowledge representations, namely knowledge graphs, to improve hallucination self-detection. Specifically, we propose a simple yet powerful approach that enriches hallucination self-detection by (i) converting LLM responses into knowledge graphs of entities and relations, and (ii) using these graphs to estimate the likelihood that a response contains hallucinations. We evaluate the proposed approach using two widely used LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across two hallucination detection datasets. To support more reliable future benchmarking, one of these datasets has been manually curated and enhanced and is released as a secondary outcome of this work. Compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT, a state-of-the-art approach, our method achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score. Our results show that LLMs can better analyse atomic facts when they are structured as knowledge graphs, even when initial outputs contain inaccuracies. This low-cost, model-agnostic approach paves the way toward safer and more trustworthy language models.

### [57] [Instruction-Following Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23572)
*Daiki Shiono,Shumpei Miyawaki,Ryota Tanaka,Jun Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LVLMs lose instruction-following ability after visual instruction tuning; including output format specifications in training data helps mitigate this decline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often fail to maintain the instruction-following capabilities of their underlying LLMs after visual instruction tuning, leading to poor task performance despite visual integration.

Method: Constructed new training datasets highlighting output format specifications, then investigated how explicitly indicating output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability through quantitative evaluation.

Result: Quantitative evaluation confirmed LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Models trained with datasets including output format instructions followed instructions more accurately than those without.

Conclusion: Including samples with instructions on output format during visual instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities of LVLMs.

Abstract: Following the initial flourishing of large language models (LLMs), there has been a surge in proposed large vision-language models (LVLMs) that integrate LLMs with vision capabilities. However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not. These findings suggest that including samples with instructions on output format during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities.

### [58] [Style Amnesia: Investigating Speaking Style Degradation and Mitigation in Multi-Turn Spoken Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23578)
*Yu-Xiang Lin,Cheng-Han Chiang,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs suffer from "style amnesia" - they cannot maintain instructed speaking styles (emotion, accent, volume, speed) across multi-turn conversations, even though they can recall the instructions when asked.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether spoken language models can consistently maintain paralinguistic speaking styles (emotion, accent, volume, speaking speed) throughout multi-turn conversations when explicitly instructed to do so.

Method: Evaluated three proprietary and two open-source SLMs by instructing them to speak in specific styles at the beginning of conversations, then testing if they maintain the style across multiple turns. Also tested recall ability and various prompting strategies including system vs user messages.

Result: None of the tested SLMs could maintain consistent speaking styles across conversations despite being able to recall the style instructions when asked. Explicitly asking models to recall instructions partially mitigated the problem. Surprisingly, SLMs performed worse when style instructions were in system messages rather than user messages.

Conclusion: SLMs suffer from "style amnesia" - a fundamental limitation where they fail to maintain instructed speaking styles throughout conversations, revealing a disconnect between instruction recall and actual style expression. This contradicts the intended function of system prompts and highlights a key area for improvement in conversational AI.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that when spoken language models (SLMs) are instructed to speak in a specific speaking style at the beginning of a multi-turn conversation, they cannot maintain the required speaking styles after several turns of interaction; we refer to this as the style amnesia of SLMs. We focus on paralinguistic speaking styles, including emotion, accent, volume, and speaking speed. We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia. In addition, we examine various prompting strategies and find that SLMs struggle to follow the required style when the instruction is placed in system messages rather than user messages, which contradicts the intended function of system prompts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfTool is a fully autonomous framework that uses multi-agent synthesis to generate diverse, verified tool-calling trajectories from raw API specs, enabling LLMs to reliably invoke external tools without human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for enabling LLMs to invoke external tools suffer from expensive human annotation, poor generalization to unseen tools, and quality ceilings from single-model synthesis that perpetuate biases and coverage gaps.

Method: InfTool orchestrates three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, and MCP Server) to generate diverse trajectories from raw API specs. It establishes a closed loop where synthesized data trains the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with gated rewards, and the improved model generates higher-quality data targeting capability gaps, iterating without human intervention.

Result: On the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), InfTool transforms a base 32B model from 19.8% to 70.9% accuracy (+258%), surpassing models 10x larger and rivaling Claude-Opus, entirely from synthetic data without human annotation.

Conclusion: InfTool breaks fundamental barriers in tool-calling for LLMs through self-evolving multi-agent synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art performance autonomously without human annotation.

Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to reliably invoke external tools remains a critical bottleneck for autonomous agents. Existing approaches suffer from three fundamental challenges: expensive human annotation for high-quality trajectories, poor generalization to unseen tools, and quality ceilings inherent in single-model synthesis that perpetuate biases and coverage gaps. We introduce InfTool, a fully autonomous framework that breaks these barriers through self-evolving multi-agent synthesis. Given only raw API specifications, InfTool orchestrates three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, and MCP Server) to generate diverse, verified trajectories spanning single-turn calls to complex multi-step workflows. The framework establishes a closed loop: synthesized data trains the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with gated rewards, the improved model generates higher-quality data targeting capability gaps, and this cycle iterates without human intervention. Experiments on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) demonstrate that InfTool transforms a base 32B model from 19.8% to 70.9% accuracy (+258%), surpassing models 10x larger and rivaling Claude-Opus, and entirely from synthetic data without human annotation.

TL;DR: Introduces CHQ-Sum, a new dataset of 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and summaries to address the lack of resources for healthcare question summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consumer health questions on the web are often overly descriptive and contain peripheral information, making natural language understanding challenging. There's a lack of domain-expert annotated datasets for healthcare question summarization, which inhibits development of effective summarization systems for this important domain.

Method: Created CHQ-Sum dataset containing 1507 consumer health questions with corresponding summaries annotated by domain experts. The dataset is derived from community question answering forums, providing real-world examples of health-related posts on social media.

Result: The paper introduces a valuable new resource for healthcare NLP research. The dataset was benchmarked on multiple state-of-the-art summarization models to demonstrate its effectiveness and utility for developing healthcare question summarization systems.

Conclusion: CHQ-Sum addresses the critical gap in domain-specific annotated data for consumer healthcare question summarization, providing a foundation for developing more effective natural language understanding systems in the healthcare domain and understanding health-related social media posts.

Abstract: The quest for seeking health information has swamped the web with consumers health-related questions. Generally, consumers use overly descriptive and peripheral information to express their medical condition or other healthcare needs, contributing to the challenges of natural language understanding. One way to address this challenge is to summarize the questions and distill the key information of the original question. Recently, large-scale datasets have significantly propelled the development of several summarization tasks, such as multi-document summarization and dialogue summarization. However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media. We benchmark the dataset on multiple state-of-the-art summarization models to show the effectiveness of the dataset

TL;DR: NestBrowse introduces a nested browser-action framework that decouples interaction control from page exploration, enabling more effective deep-web information acquisition for information-seeking agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current information-seeking agents are limited to API-level snippet retrieval and URL-based page fetching, restricting access to richer information available through real browsing. Full browser interaction could unlock deeper capabilities but introduces complexity for ReAct-style function-calling agents due to fine-grained control and verbose page content returns.

Method: Proposes Nested Browser-Use Learning (NestBrowse), which introduces a minimal and complete browser-action framework with a nested structure that decouples interaction control from page exploration. This design simplifies agentic reasoning while enabling effective deep-web information acquisition.

Result: Empirical results on challenging deep information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that NestBrowse offers clear benefits in practice. Further in-depth analyses underscore its efficiency and flexibility.

Conclusion: NestBrowse successfully bridges the gap between simple API-level retrieval and complex full browser interaction, providing a practical solution for deep-web information acquisition by information-seeking agents.

Abstract: Information-seeking (IS) agents have achieved strong performance across a range of wide and deep search tasks, yet their tool use remains largely restricted to API-level snippet retrieval and URL-based page fetching, limiting access to the richer information available through real browsing. While full browser interaction could unlock deeper capabilities, its fine-grained control and verbose page content returns introduce substantial complexity for ReAct-style function-calling agents. To bridge this gap, we propose Nested Browser-Use Learning (NestBrowse), which introduces a minimal and complete browser-action framework that decouples interaction control from page exploration through a nested structure. This design simplifies agentic reasoning while enabling effective deep-web information acquisition. Empirical results on challenging deep IS benchmarks demonstrate that NestBrowse offers clear benefits in practice. Further in-depth analyses underscore its efficiency and flexibility.

TL;DR: The paper examines how much linguistic context is needed to study relationships between language model probabilities and cognitive phenomena, finding that n-gram representations (not whole utterances) are sufficient for observing probabilistic reduction effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the appropriate amount of linguistic context required when investigating connections between language model probability patterns and cognitive processing phenomena, particularly whether full utterances are necessary or if smaller units suffice.

Method: The researchers investigate whether n-gram representations (shorter sequences of words) can serve as adequate cognitive units of planning, testing if these smaller linguistic units are sufficient to observe probabilistic reduction effects.

Result: The study demonstrates that whole utterances are not necessary to observe probabilistic reduction; n-gram representations suffice as cognitive units of planning for studying language model probability-cognition relationships.

Conclusion: N-gram representations provide sufficient context for investigating relationships between language model probabilities and cognitive phenomena, offering a more efficient and appropriate unit of analysis than whole utterances for such research.

Abstract: The primary research questions of this paper center on defining the amount of context that is necessary and/or appropriate when investigating the relationship between language model probabilities and cognitive phenomena. We investigate whether whole utterances are necessary to observe probabilistic reduction and demonstrate that n-gram representations suffice as cognitive units of planning.

*Panagiotis Theocharopoulos,Ajinkya Kulkarni,Mathew Magimai. -Doss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based academic peer review systems are vulnerable to document-level hidden prompt injection attacks, with varying susceptibility across different languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in high-impact workflows like academic peer review, there's a need to understand their vulnerability to document-level hidden prompt injection attacks where malicious instructions can be embedded within submitted papers.

Method: Constructed a dataset of ~500 real ICML-accepted papers, embedded hidden adversarial prompts with semantically equivalent instructions in four languages (English, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic), and evaluated their impact on LLM-based review scores and decisions.

Result: Prompt injection caused substantial changes in review scores and accept/reject decisions for English, Japanese, and Chinese injections, but Arabic injections produced little to no effect, revealing language-dependent vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: LLM-based reviewing systems are susceptible to document-level prompt injection attacks, with significant differences in vulnerability across languages, highlighting security risks in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered for use in high-impact workflows, including academic peer review. However, LLMs are vulnerable to document-level hidden prompt injection attacks. In this work, we construct a dataset of approximately 500 real academic papers accepted to ICML and evaluate the effect of embedding hidden adversarial prompts within these documents. Each paper is injected with semantically equivalent instructions in four different languages and reviewed using an LLM. We find that prompt injection induces substantial changes in review scores and accept/reject decisions for English, Japanese, and Chinese injections, while Arabic injections produce little to no effect. These results highlight the susceptibility of LLM-based reviewing systems to document-level prompt injection and reveal notable differences in vulnerability across languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProfASR-Bench is a professional ASR evaluation suite for high-stakes domains (finance, medicine, legal, tech) that reveals current models underutilize contextual prompts despite being promptable, showing a "context-utilization gap."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASR benchmarks underplay challenges in professional settings: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. There's a need for evaluation that measures context-conditioned recognition in high-stakes applications.

Method: Created ProfASR-Bench with natural-language prompts (domain cues/speaker profiles) paired with entity-rich target utterances. Evaluated Whisper and Qwen-Omni models under various context conditions (no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, adversarial) using conventional ASR metrics plus entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent/gender.

Result: Lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average WER, even with oracle prompts. Adversarial prompts don't reliably degrade performance. This reveals a "context-utilization gap" - current systems are promptable but underuse available side information.

Conclusion: ProfASR-Bench provides standardized context ladder, entity/slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families to address the context-utilization gap in professional ASR.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in professional settings faces challenges that existing benchmarks underplay: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.

*Sky CH-Wang,Justin Svegliato,Helen Appel,Jason Eisner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for fine-tuning language models using feedback-driven improvement chains where annotators mark liked/disliked spans, the model rewrites disliked spans incrementally, and preference pairs are created from adjacent steps for more effective alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve preference tuning of language models by providing more structured, fine-grained feedback that enables localized, targeted edits rather than just binary A/B preferences or full contrastive rewrites.

Method: Annotators provide fine-grained feedback by marking liked/disliked spans in model responses and specifying what they liked/disliked. The base model then rewrites disliked spans from left to right, creating incremental improvement chains. Preference pairs are constructed from each adjacent step in the chain for direct alignment training.

Result: The approach outperforms direct alignment methods based on standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, demonstrating that structured, revision-based supervision leads to more efficient and effective preference tuning.

Conclusion: Feedback-driven improvement chains with fine-grained span-level feedback and incremental rewriting provide superior preference supervision compared to traditional methods, enabling more targeted learning from localized edits.

Abstract: We present a method and dataset for fine-tuning language models with preference supervision using feedback-driven improvement chains. Given a model response, an annotator provides fine-grained feedback by marking ``liked'' and ``disliked'' spans and specifying what they liked or disliked about them. The base model then rewrites the disliked spans accordingly, proceeding from left to right, forming a sequence of incremental improvements. We construct preference pairs for direct alignment from each adjacent step in the chain, enabling the model to learn from localized, targeted edits. We find that our approach outperforms direct alignment methods based on standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, demonstrating that structured, revision-based supervision leads to more efficient and effective preference tuning.

*Jing Huang,Shujian Zhang,Lun Wang,Andrew Hard,Rajiv Mathews,John Lambert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies behavior elicitation methods for LLMs in multi-turn conversations, categorizing approaches into three families and showing online methods achieve high success rates with few queries compared to static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavior elicitation techniques for LLMs are mainly studied in single-turn settings, but real-world applications involve multi-turn conversations. There's a need to extend these methods to conversational contexts for better evaluation of LLM behaviors.

Method: 1) Developed analytical framework categorizing methods into three families: prior knowledge only, offline interactions, and online interactions. 2) Introduced generalized multi-turn formulation of online methods unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. 3) Evaluated all three families on automatically generating multi-turn test cases, analyzing trade-off between query budget and success rate.

Result: Online methods achieved average success rates of 45%, 19%, and 77% across three tasks with just a few thousand queries, while static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks found few or no failure cases.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the effectiveness of behavior elicitation methods for multi-turn conversation evaluation and highlights the need for the community to move from static to dynamic benchmarks for more comprehensive LLM assessment.

Abstract: Identifying specific and often complex behaviors from large language models (LLMs) in conversational settings is crucial for their evaluation. Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks.

*Vatsal Baherwani,Yixuan Ren,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how motion is encoded across timesteps in text-to-video diffusion models, identifying distinct motion-dominant and appearance-dominant regimes, and simplifies motion customization by focusing on the motion-dominant regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While practitioners use the heuristic that early timesteps shape motion/layout and later ones refine appearance, this behavior hasn't been systematically characterized. Understanding motion encoding across timesteps is crucial for better video generation control.

Method: Proxies motion encoding by analyzing the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation when injecting new conditions over specific timestep ranges. Conducts large-scale quantitative study across diverse architectures to map how motion and appearance compete along the denoising trajectory.

Result: Consistently identifies an early motion-dominant regime and later appearance-dominant regime across architectures, establishing an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Shows that restricting training/inference to motion-dominant regime simplifies motion customization without needing debiasing modules or specialized objectives.

Conclusion: Turns the widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle. The timestep-constrained recipe provides ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods, offering a simpler and more effective approach to motion customization.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models synthesize temporal motion and spatial appearance through iterative denoising, yet how motion is encoded across timesteps remains poorly understood. Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.

TL;DR: VISTA is a modular framework that separates perception from reasoning in VLMs using an information bottleneck, trained with RL to reduce reliance on spurious correlations and improve visual reasoning robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end VLMs often exploit spurious correlations rather than causal visual evidence when answering questions, and this problem worsens with fine-tuning. There's a need for more robust visual reasoning that doesn't rely on shortcuts.

Method: VISTA uses a modular approach with a frozen VLM sensor restricted to short, objective perception queries, and a text-only LLM reasoner that decomposes questions, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts. It creates a controlled interface for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning (GRPO) using only 641 curated multi-step questions.

Result: VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), remains competitive on MMVP and SeedBench, transfers across unseen VLM sensors, and can recognize/recover from VLM perception failures.

Conclusion: The modular separation of perception and reasoning via information bottleneck enables more robust visual reasoning that is less reliant on spurious correlations, produces more neutral reasoning traces, and better grounds decisions in visual evidence compared to end-to-end VLMs.

Abstract: End-to-end Vision-language Models (VLMs) often answer visual questions by exploiting spurious correlations instead of causal visual evidence, and can become more shortcut-prone when fine-tuned. We introduce VISTA (Visual-Information Separation for Text-based Analysis), a modular framework that decouples perception from reasoning via an explicit information bottleneck. A frozen VLM sensor is restricted to short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes each question, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. This controlled interface defines a reward-aligned environment for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning. Instantiated with Qwen2.5-VL and Llama3.2-Vision sensors, and trained with GRPO from only 641 curated multi-step questions, VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), while remaining competitive on MMVP and a balanced SeedBench subset. VISTA transfers robustly across unseen VLM sensors and is able to recognize and recover from VLM perception failures. Human analysis further shows that VISTA's reasoning traces are more neutral, less reliant on spurious attributes, and more explicitly grounded in visual evidence than end-to-end VLM baselines.

### [71] [SAMM2D: Scale-Aware Multi-Modal 2D Dual-Encoder for High-Sensitivity Intracrania Aneurysm Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22185)
*Antara Titikhsha,Divyanshu Tak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMM2D is a dual-encoder framework for intracranial aneurysm detection that achieves 32% improvement over clinical baseline, with the surprising finding that data augmentation actually degrades performance when using strong pretrained backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aneurysm detection is challenging due to subtle morphology, class imbalance, and scarce annotated data. Current methods struggle with these limitations in medical imaging.

Method: SAMM2D dual-encoder framework using ImageNet-pretrained backbone without data augmentation. Comprehensive ablation study across six augmentation regimes to test the "more augmentation is better" assumption.

Result: Achieved AUC of 0.686 (32% improvement over baseline). Unaugmented model outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75-2.23 percentage points (p<0.01). With threshold calibration, reached 95% sensitivity surpassing radiologist performance, with projected $13.9M savings per 1,000 patients. Grad-CAM shows 85% of true positives attend to relevant vascular regions.

Conclusion: Strong pretrained features capture robust invariances, making additional augmentations redundant and disruptive. Future medical imaging workflows should prioritize strong pretraining over complex augmentation pipelines.

Abstract: Effective aneurysm detection is essential to avert life-threatening hemorrhages, but it remains challenging due to the subtle morphology of the aneurysm, pronounced class imbalance, and the scarcity of annotated data. We introduce SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework that achieves an AUC of 0.686 on the RSNA intracranial aneurysm dataset; an improvement of 32% over the clinical baseline. In a comprehensive ablation across six augmentation regimes, we made a striking discovery: any form of data augmentation degraded performance when coupled with a strong pretrained backbone. Our unaugmented baseline model outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75--2.23 percentage points (p < 0.01), overturning the assumption that "more augmentation is always better" in low-data medical settings. We hypothesize that ImageNet-pretrained features already capture robust invariances, rendering additional augmentations both redundant and disruptive to the learned feature manifold. By calibrating the decision threshold, SAMM2D reaches 95% sensitivity, surpassing average radiologist performance, and translates to a projected \$13.9M in savings per 1,000 patients in screening applications. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that 85% of true positives attend to relevant vascular regions (62% IoU with expert annotations), demonstrating the model's clinically meaningful focus. Our results suggest that future medical imaging workflows could benefit more from strong pretraining than from increasingly complex augmentation pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HookMIL is a context-aware Multiple Instance Learning framework for computational pathology that uses learnable hook tokens for efficient contextual aggregation with linear complexity, outperforming traditional MIL and transformer-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MIL approaches lose crucial contextual information in whole-slide images, while transformer-based variants suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations, limiting their practical application in computational pathology.

Method: Proposes HookMIL with learnable hook tokens initialized from multiple sources: key-patch visual features, text embeddings from vision-language models, and spatial transcriptomics features. Uses bidirectional attention with linear complexity, Hook Diversity Loss for pattern specialization, and hook-to-hook communication for refined contextual interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets show state-of-the-art performance with improved computational efficiency and interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: HookMIL addresses key limitations of existing MIL approaches by providing efficient context-aware learning with multimodal initialization, achieving superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency in computational pathology applications.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has enabled weakly supervised analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tiny-YOLOSAM: A hybrid pipeline combining YOLOv12 detection with TinySAM segmentation to achieve fast full-scene segmentation by using detector-generated box prompts and sparse point prompts only where needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM and TinySAM are computationally expensive for latency-critical applications, and TinySAM's "segment-everything" mode requires hundreds of prompts and remains slow in practice.

Method: First replicated TinySAM on COCO val2017 to establish baseline. Then proposed Tiny-YOLOSAM: uses YOLOv12 detector to generate box prompts for salient foreground objects, supplemented with sparse point prompts only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage.

Result: On COCO val2017: class-agnostic coverage improved dramatically (AR: 16.4%→77.1%, mIoU: 19.2%→67.8%). End-to-end runtime reduced from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x speedup) on Apple M1 Pro CPU.

Conclusion: Detector-guided prompting combined with targeted sparse sampling is an effective alternative to dense "segment-everything" prompting for practical full-scene segmentation, offering significant speed improvements while maintaining quality.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables promptable, high-quality segmentation but is often too computationally expensive for latency-critical settings. TinySAM is a lightweight, distilled SAM variant that preserves strong zero-shot mask quality, yet its "segment-everything" mode still requires hundreds of prompts and remains slow in practice. We first replicate TinySAM on COCO val2017 using official checkpoints, matching the reported AP within 0.03%, establishing a reliable experimental baseline. Building on this, we propose Tiny-YOLOSAM, a fast hybrid pipeline that uses a recent YOLO detector (YOLOv12) to generate box prompts for TinySAM on salient foreground objects, and supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts sampled only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage. On COCO val2017, the hybrid system substantially improves class-agnostic coverage (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x) on an Apple M1 Pro CPU. These results suggest detector-guided prompting combined with targeted sparse sampling as an effective alternative to dense "segment-everything" prompting for practical full-scene segmentation.

*Shivum Telang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal explainability model using VLM with few-shot learning generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps across OCT and fundus images to explain DR severity classification through lesion distribution analysis in retinal quadrants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for DR detection lack practical clinical interpretability - they either require impractical manual lesion annotation or provide insufficient explanations. Physicians need models that explain classification reasoning rather than just highlighting lesions. Existing models are also limited by using single imaging modalities.

Method: Multimodal explainability model using Vision-Language Model (VLM) with few-shot learning that mimics ophthalmologist reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants. Generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps showing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images to visually highlight regions contributing to DR severity classification.

Result: Developed using dataset of 3,000 fundus images and 1,000 OCT images. The model provides visual explanations of DR severity classification through heatmaps that show contributing regions in both imaging modalities, addressing limitations of current diagnostic approaches.

Conclusion: This innovative methodology offers a practical and comprehensive tool for improving DR patient outcomes by providing multimodal explainability that better serves clinical needs for screening, treatment, and research applications.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, requiring early detection to preserve sight. Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps, showcasing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images, which visually highlight the regions contributing to DR severity classification. Using a dataset of 3,000 fundus images and 1,000 OCT images, this innovative methodology addresses key limitations in current DR diagnostics, offering a practical and comprehensive tool for improving patient outcomes.

### [75] [TCFormer: A 5M-Parameter Transformer with Density-Guided Aggregation for Weakly-Supervised Crowd Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22203)
*Qiang Guo,Rubo Zhang,Bingbing Zhang,Junjie Liu,Jianqing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCFormer is a tiny transformer-based crowd counting model with only 5M parameters that achieves competitive performance using only image-level count labels, making it suitable for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional crowd counting requires labor-intensive point-level annotations and computationally heavy models, limiting scalability and deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Uses a lightweight vision transformer as feature extractor, adds Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module to re-weight local tokens based on predicted density, and introduces density-level classification loss to discretize crowd density into grades.

Result: Achieves superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy on ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets, with only 5M parameters.

Conclusion: TCFormer provides an effective weakly-supervised solution for crowd counting that balances accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: Crowd counting typically relies on labor-intensive point-level annotations and computationally intensive backbones, restricting its scalability and deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional malaria diagnosis via microscopic blood smear analysis has low sensitivity, requires expert judgment, and lacks resources in remote settings, necessitating automated, accurate alternatives.

Method: Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automatic classification of blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected, compared against ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121 architectures with Explainable AI techniques (SHAP, LIME, Saliency Maps).

Result: Model achieves 96% accuracy with precision and recall scores exceeding 0.95 for both classes, demonstrating superior performance compared to established deep learning architectures.

Conclusion: Deep learning provides quick, accurate, and interpretable malaria diagnosis suitable for resource-limited areas, addressing limitations of traditional diagnostic methods.

Abstract: Malaria remains a prevalent health concern in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The cause of malaria is the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic blood smear analysis, are low in sensitivity, depend on expert judgment, and require resources that may not be available in remote settings. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a deep learning-based approach utilizing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected. The model achieves an accuracy of 96%, with precision and recall scores exceeding 0.95 for both classes. This study also compares the custom CNN with established deep learning architectures, including ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121. To enhance model interpretability, Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and Saliency Maps are applied. The proposed system shows how deep learning can provide quick, accurate and understandable malaria diagnosis, especially in areas with limited resources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Signal-SGN++ is a topology-aware spiking graph framework that combines structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics for energy-efficient action recognition, outperforming SNN methods and achieving competitive results with GCNs at much lower energy costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCNs are effective for skeletal action recognition but energy-intensive due to dense floating-point computations. SNNs offer energy efficiency through event-driven sparse activation but struggle to capture coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes Signal-SGN++ with: 1) 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) backbone for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction; 2) Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism for adaptive attention routing across learned skeletal topologies; 3) Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch with Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit for multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations with structural priors.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks show Signal-SGN++ achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs under substantially reduced energy consumption.

Conclusion: Signal-SGN++ successfully bridges the gap between GCNs and SNNs by integrating structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics, offering an energy-efficient solution for skeletal action recognition that maintains competitive accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) demonstrate strong capability in modeling skeletal topology for action recognition, yet their dense floating-point computations incur high energy costs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by event-driven and sparse activation, offer energy efficiency but remain limited in capturing coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction. Within this backbone, a Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism is embedded to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies, enhancing graph-level sensitivity without increasing computational complexity. Moreover, an auxiliary Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch decomposes spiking features into multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations, wherein a Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit incorporates structural priors to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate that Signal-SGN++ achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs under substantially reduced energy consumption.

*Tasha Pais,Nikhilesh Belulkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic Abstraction uses 2D VLMs' relevancy maps as abstract object representations to learn 3D localization and completion for hidden/occluded objects, enabling faster search than random methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable household robots to efficiently find lost or hidden objects that are occluded and cannot be directly identified by vision-language models, saving time and effort in unstructured search tasks.

Method: Uses 2D VLMs' relevancy activation maps as "abstract object" representations, then learns 3D localization and completion for hidden objects by leveraging historical data about where objects are frequently placed to guide search.

Result: The model can accurately identify complete 3D location of hidden objects on the first try significantly faster than naive random search approaches.

Conclusion: Semantic Abstraction extensions provide household robots with skills to efficiently search for lost objects by leveraging abstract object representations and historical placement data.

Abstract: Semantic Abstraction's key observation is that 2D VLMs' relevancy activations roughly correspond to their confidence of whether and where an object is in the scene. Thus, relevancy maps are treated as "abstract object" representations. We use this framework for learning 3D localization and completion for the exclusive domain of hidden objects, defined as objects that cannot be directly identified by a VLM because they are at least partially occluded. This process of localizing hidden objects is a form of unstructured search that can be performed more efficiently using historical data of where an object is frequently placed. Our model can accurately identify the complete 3D location of a hidden object on the first try significantly faster than a naive random search. These extensions to semantic abstraction hope to provide household robots with the skills necessary to save time and effort when looking for lost objects.

TL;DR: VideoScaffold: A dynamic representation framework for streaming video understanding that adaptively adjusts event granularity while preserving visual semantics, achieving SOTA performance on video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static strategies for video understanding (sparse sampling, frame compression, clustering) are optimized for offline settings and produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams, failing to handle temporal coherence and redundancy across frames effectively.

Method: VideoScaffold introduces two key components: 1) Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES) for prediction-guided dynamic refinement of event boundaries, and 2) Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC) for progressive aggregation of semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. These work together to enable smooth transition from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension.

Conclusion: VideoScaffold provides an effective dynamic representation framework for streaming video understanding that addresses limitations of static approaches, offering adaptive event granularity adjustment while preserving visual semantics, with demonstrated superior performance on video benchmarks.

Abstract: Understanding long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging due to the heavy redundancy across frames and the need for temporally coherent representations. Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension. The code is available at https://github.com/zheng980629/VideoScaffold.

### [82] [KAN-FPN-Stem:A KAN-Enhanced Feature Pyramid Stem for Boosting ViT-based Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22228)
*HaoNan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KAN-FPN-Stem improves ViT-based pose estimation by replacing FPN's final linear convolution with KAN-based layer for better multi-scale fusion, achieving +2.0 AP gain over ViTPose-S.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ViT front-ends for dense prediction tasks like pose estimation suffer from simplistic patchification mechanisms that cause irreversible information loss and struggle with multi-scale variations. The performance bottleneck lies in feature fusion quality rather than feature refinement.

Method: Retains classic FPN's "upsample-and-add" fusion stream but replaces the terminal 3x3 linear smoothing convolution with a KAN-based convolutional layer. This leverages KAN's superior non-linear modeling to adaptively learn and rectify artifacts from multi-scale fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on COCO dataset show KAN-FPN-Stem achieves significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. The method is plug-and-play and reveals the true bottleneck is in feature fusion quality.

Conclusion: The work provides both a high-performance plug-and-play module and important insight: ViT front-end performance bottleneck often lies in feature fusion quality rather than feature refinement. KAN operator offers an effective path to address this bottleneck.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated significant promise in dense prediction tasks such as pose estimation. However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic "upsample-and-add" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the "artifacts" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion). Furthermore, it provides an effective path to address this bottleneck through the introduction of the KAN operator.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MiG-DM is a meta-information guided cross-domain diffusion model that integrates clinical parameters and cross-modal priors to generate high-quality low-dose PET images by combining projection-domain physics with image-domain processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose PET imaging reduces patient radiation exposure but suffers from noise, reduced contrast, and difficulty preserving physiological details. Existing methods neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information needed for functional-semantic correlation mining.

Method: MiG-DM integrates meta-information encoding that transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts considering patient characteristics, dose information, and semi-quantitative parameters. It uses cross-domain architecture combining projection-domain processing (with sinogram adapter capturing global physical structures) and image-domain processing through a synergistic diffusion model.

Result: Experiments on UDPET public dataset and clinical datasets with varying dose levels show MiG-DM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

Conclusion: The proposed MiG-DM successfully addresses low-dose PET imaging challenges by integrating comprehensive cross-modal priors and meta-information guidance, demonstrating superior performance in generating high-quality PET images while preserving crucial physiological information.

Abstract: Low-dose PET imaging is crucial for reducing patient radiation exposure but faces challenges like noise interference, reduced contrast, and difficulty in preserving physiological details. Existing methods often neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information, which are critical for functional-semantic correlation mining. In this study, we introduce a meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model (MiG-DM) that integrates comprehensive cross-modal priors to generate high-quality PET images. Specifically, a meta-information encoding module transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts by considering patient characteristics, dose-related information, and semi-quantitative parameters, enabling cross-modal alignment between textual meta-information and image reconstruction. Additionally, the cross-domain architecture combines projection-domain and image-domain processing. In the projection domain, a specialized sinogram adapter captures global physical structures through convolution operations equivalent to global image-domain filtering. Experiments on the UDPET public dataset and clinical datasets with varying dose levels demonstrate that MiG-DM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

TL;DR: A hybrid knowledge distillation framework creates lightweight CNN for edge devices in smart agriculture, achieving near-teacher accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost and model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices in smart agriculture is challenging due to the trade-off between computational efficiency and recognition accuracy.

Method: Proposes a hybrid knowledge distillation framework with a customized student model combining inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity, trained under ResNet18 teacher guidance using multi-objective strategy integrating hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation.

Result: On rice seed variety classification, distilled student achieves 98.56% accuracy (vs teacher's 98.65%) with only 0.68 GFLOPs and ~1.07M parameters - 2.7× less computation and >10× smaller than ResNet18. Reduces parameters by >6× vs DenseNet121 and >80× vs ViT while maintaining comparable/superior accuracy. Consistent gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems through significant model compression while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices remains a major challenge in smart agriculture due to the trade-off between computational efficiency and recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid knowledge distillation framework for developing a lightweight yet high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed approach designs a customized student model that combines inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity and trains it under the guidance of a ResNet18 teacher network using a multi-objective strategy that integrates hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation. Experiments are conducted on a rice seed variety identification dataset containing nine varieties and further extended to four plant leaf disease datasets, including rice, potato, coffee, and corn, to evaluate generalization capability. On the rice seed variety classification task, the distilled student model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, which is only 0.09% lower than the teacher model (98.65%), while requiring only 0.68 GFLOPs and approximately 1.07 million parameters. This corresponds to a reduction of about 2.7 times in computational cost and more than 10 times in model size compared with the ResNet18 teacher model. In addition, compared with representative pretrained models, the proposed student reduces the number of parameters by more than 6 times relative to DenseNet121 and by over 80 times compared with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, while maintaining comparable or superior classification accuracy. Consistent performance gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets further demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential of the proposed framework for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems.

TL;DR: Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion framework for robotic vision in varying light conditions, using multiple fusion ratios to dynamically select optimal detection models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB detection struggles in low-light, while thermal systems lack color/texture info. Need robust vision for emergency service robots in diverse lighting conditions.

Method: Trained 33 YOLO models on 22k+ annotated images across three light levels. Fused RGB and LWIR streams at 11 different ratios (100/0 to 0/100 in 10% increments). Dynamic model selection based on illumination.

Result: Best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR): 92.8% mean confidence; dim-light model (90/10): 92.0%; both significantly outperformed YOLOv5n/YOLOv11n baselines. No-light model (40/60): 71.0% (exceeded baselines but not statistically significant).

Conclusion: Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improves detection confidence and reliability across all illumination conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic vision performance for emergency services.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic platforms are playing a growing role across the emergency services sector, supporting missions such as search and rescue operations in disaster zones and reconnaissance. However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments. Evaluation showed that the best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR) and dim-light model (90/10 fusion) achieved 92.8% and 92.0% mean confidence; both significantly outperformed the YOLOv5 nano (YOLOv5n) and YOLOv11 nano (YOLOv11n) baselines. Under no-light conditions, the top 40/60 fusion reached 71.0%, exceeding baselines though not statistically significant. Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improved detection confidence and reliability across all illumination conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic vision performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using lightweight discriminators as external guidance, researchers separate geometry from style in text-to-image diffusion models, improving geometric control by ~80% without specialized training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models generate detailed textures but often fail to follow strict geometric constraints, especially when geometry conflicts with text-specified style. There's a semantic gap between human perception (which prioritizes shape) and generative models (which prioritize appearance).

Method: Propose Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on THINGS triplet dataset to capture human sensitivity to object shape. Inject gradients from this teacher into latent diffusion process to separate geometry and style controllably. Evaluate across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 (U-Net), SiT-XL/2 (flow-matching), and PixArt-Σ (diffusion transformer).

Result: Flow models tend to drift back to default trajectories without continuous guidance. Achieve zero-shot transfer of complex 3D shapes (e.g., Eames chair) onto conflicting materials (e.g., pink metal). Guided generation improves semantic alignment by ~80% compared to unguided baselines.

Conclusion: Small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis without requiring specialized training.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate highly detailed textures, yet they often rely on surface appearance and fail to follow strict geometric constraints, particularly when those constraints conflict with the style implied by the text prompt. This reflects a broader semantic gap between human perception and current generative models. We investigate whether geometric understanding can be introduced without specialized training by using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guidance signals. We propose a Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on the THINGS triplet dataset, which captures human sensitivity to object shape. By injecting gradients from this teacher into the latent diffusion process, we show that geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner. We evaluate this approach across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with a U-Net backbone, the flow-matching model SiT-XL/2, and the diffusion transformer PixArt-Σ. Our experiments reveal that flow models tend to drift back toward their default trajectories without continuous guidance, and we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of complex three-dimensional shapes, such as an Eames chair, onto conflicting materials such as pink metal. This guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80 percent compared to unguided baselines. Overall, our results show that small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The B&J Benchmark reveals AI models excel at structured medical questions (90%+ accuracy) but struggle with open-ended multimodal clinical reasoning (60% accuracy), showing VLMs have severe visual interpretation limitations and hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI benchmarks based on licensing exams fail to capture real-world clinical reasoning that requires integrated multimodal analysis, necessitating more comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

Method: Developed the Bones and Joints Benchmark with 1,245 questions from real patient cases across 7 clinical reasoning tasks, evaluating 11 VLMs and 6 LLMs against expert ground truth.

Result: Large performance gap: models achieve >90% accuracy on structured multiple-choice questions but only ~60% on open-ended multimodal tasks; VLMs show severe visual interpretation limitations and hallucinations; medical fine-tuning provides no consistent advantage.

Conclusion: Current AI models lack clinical competence for complex multimodal reasoning and should be limited to supportive text-based roles; fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration are needed for clinical advancement.

Abstract: Background: The rapid integration of foundation models into clinical practice and public health necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their true clinical reasoning capabilities beyond narrow examination success. Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles. Future advancement in core clinical tasks awaits fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration and visual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing global shortage of trained sonographers and barriers to fetal health monitoring by leveraging deep learning, particularly VLMs for ultrasound interpretation. Lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating VLMs in fetal ultrasound due to modality challenges and limited public datasets.

Method: Created Fetal-Gauge benchmark with over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs covering multiple clinical tasks: anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. Systematically evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs including general-purpose and medical-specific models.

Result: Best-performing model achieved only 55% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Revealed substantial performance gap and critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation.

Conclusion: Urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches for fetal ultrasound. Fetal-Gauge establishes rigorous foundation for advancing multimodal deep learning in prenatal care and addresses global healthcare accessibility challenges.

Abstract: The growing demand for prenatal ultrasound imaging has intensified a global shortage of trained sonographers, creating barriers to essential fetal health monitoring. Deep learning has the potential to enhance sonographers' efficiency and support the training of new practitioners. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are particularly promising for ultrasound interpretation, as they can jointly process images and text to perform multiple clinical tasks within a single framework. However, despite the expansion of VLMs, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in fetal ultrasound imaging. This gap is primarily due to the modality's challenging nature, operator dependency, and the limited public availability of datasets. To address this gap, we present Fetal-Gauge, the first and largest visual question answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs across various fetal ultrasound tasks. Our benchmark comprises over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs, spanning anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of anatomical structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs, including general-purpose and medical-specific models, and reveal a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model achieves only 55\% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Our analysis identifies critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation, highlighting the urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches. Fetal-Gauge establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing multimodal deep learning in prenatal care and provides a pathway toward addressing global healthcare accessibility challenges. Our benchmark will be publicly available once the paper gets accepted.

Abstract: In-cabin Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) must recognize distraction- and drowsiness-related behaviors with low latency under strict constraints on compute, power, and cost. We present a single-camera in-cabin driver behavior recognition system designed for deployment on two low-cost edge platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only) and Google Coral Edge TPU. The proposed pipeline combines (i) a compact per-frame vision model, (ii) a confounder-aware label design to reduce visually similar false positives, and (iii) a temporal decision head that triggers alerts only when predictions are both confident and sustained. The system covers 17 behavior classes, including multiple phone-use modes, eating/drinking, smoking, reaching behind, gaze/attention shifts, passenger interaction, grooming, control-panel interaction, yawning, and eyes-closed sleep. Training and evaluation use licensed datasets spanning diverse drivers, vehicles, and lighting conditions (details in Section 6), and we further validate runtime behavior in real in-vehicle tests. The optimized deployments achieve about 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 with INT8 inference (per-frame latency under 60 ms) and about 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring and stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware. Finally, we discuss how reliable in-cabin human-state perception can serve as an upstream input for human-centered vehicle intelligence, including emerging agentic vehicle concepts.

Conclusion: Presents a modular, data-efficient, practically deployable baseline for attack-aware detection with calibrated probabilities and actionable heatmaps that maintains robustness under realistic adversarial conditions.

Abstract: This work presents an attack-aware deepfake and image-forensics detector designed for robustness, well-calibrated probabilities, and transparent evidence under realistic deployment conditions. The method combines red-team training with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture, where one stream encodes semantic content using a pretrained backbone and the other extracts forensic residuals, fused via a lightweight residual adapter for classification, while a shallow Feature Pyramid Network style head produces tamper heatmaps under weak supervision. Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions. Heatmaps are guided to concentrate within face regions using face-box masks without strict pixel-level annotations. Evaluation on existing benchmarks, including standard deepfake datasets and a surveillance-style split with low light and heavy compression, reports clean and attacked performance, AUC, worst-case accuracy, reliability, abstention quality, and weak-localization scores. Results demonstrate near-perfect ranking across attacks, low calibration error, minimal abstention risk, and controlled degradation under regrain, establishing a modular, data-efficient, and practically deployable baseline for attack-aware detection with calibrated probabilities and actionable heatmaps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoFu is a unified framework for multi-subject video generation that addresses scale inconsistency and permutation sensitivity through Scale-Aware Modulation and Fourier Fusion, achieving better subject fidelity and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-subject video generation methods suffer from two main problems: scale inconsistency (unnatural subject size variations) and permutation sensitivity (subject distortion based on reference input order), which degrade the quality and fidelity of generated videos.

Method: MoFu introduces three key components: 1) Scale-Aware Modulation (SMO) - an LLM-guided module that extracts implicit scale cues from prompts to modulate features for consistent subject sizes, 2) Fourier Fusion - processes reference features via Fast Fourier Transform to create unified representations insensitive to input order, and 3) Scale-Permutation Stability Loss - jointly encourages scale-consistent and permutation-invariant generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoFu significantly outperforms existing methods in preserving natural scale, subject fidelity, and overall visual quality. The authors also establish a dedicated benchmark to evaluate scale and permutation challenges.

Conclusion: MoFu successfully addresses the key challenges in multi-subject video generation through its unified framework, demonstrating superior performance in generating videos with consistent subject scales and permutation-invariant representations while maintaining high visual quality.

Abstract: Multi-subject video generation aims to synthesize videos from textual prompts and multiple reference images, ensuring that each subject preserves natural scale and visual fidelity. However, current methods face two challenges: scale inconsistency, where variations in subject size lead to unnatural generation, and permutation sensitivity, where the order of reference inputs causes subject distortion. In this paper, we propose MoFu, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For scale inconsistency, we introduce Scale-Aware Modulation (SMO), an LLM-guided module that extracts implicit scale cues from the prompt and modulates features to ensure consistent subject sizes. To address permutation sensitivity, we present a simple yet effective Fourier Fusion strategy that processes the frequency information of reference features via the Fast Fourier Transform to produce a unified representation. Besides, we design a Scale-Permutation Stability Loss to jointly encourage scale-consistent and permutation-invariant generation. To further evaluate these challenges, we establish a dedicated benchmark with controlled variations in subject scale and reference permutation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoFu significantly outperforms existing methods in preserving natural scale, subject fidelity, and overall visual quality.

TL;DR: VideoZoomer: An agentic framework enabling MLLMs to dynamically control visual focus during reasoning for long video understanding, using temporal zooming to gather fine-grained evidence progressively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long video understanding due to limited context windows, relying on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection that may miss critical evidence and cannot correct selection errors during reasoning.

Method: Proposes VideoZoomer framework where MLLMs start with coarse low-frame-rate overview, then invoke temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments in multi-turn interactions. Uses two-stage training: cold-start supervised fine-tuning on distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to refine agentic policy.

Result: The 7B model demonstrates diverse and complex reasoning patterns, achieving strong performance across long video understanding benchmarks, surpassing open-source models and rivaling proprietary systems while maintaining superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.

Conclusion: VideoZoomer enables MLLMs to dynamically control visual focus during reasoning, overcoming limitations of static approaches and achieving state-of-the-art performance in long video understanding through progressive evidence gathering.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks yet remain limited in long video understanding due to the limited context window. Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.

*Zhibin Qin,Zhenxiong Tan,Zeqing Wang,Songhua Liu,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpotEdit is a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only modified regions instead of uniformly processing all tokens, reducing redundant computation while preserving unchanged areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion transformer models uniformly process and denoise all tokens at every timestep, even though most edits involve only small region modifications. This causes redundant computation and potentially degrades unchanged areas, raising the question of whether it's necessary to regenerate every region during editing.

Method: SpotEdit has two key components: 1) SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; 2) SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism to preserve contextual coherence and editing quality.

Result: By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing.

Conclusion: SpotEdit provides a training-free solution for selective region editing in diffusion transformers, addressing the inefficiency of uniform token processing while preserving editing quality and contextual coherence.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models have significantly advanced image editing by encoding conditional images and integrating them into transformer layers. However, most edits involve modifying only small regions, while current methods uniformly process and denoise all tokens at every timestep, causing redundant computation and potentially degrading unchanged areas. This raises a fundamental question: Is it truly necessary to regenerate every region during editing? To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality. By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing.

*Jianrong Zhang,Hehe Fan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeMoGen: A compositional training paradigm using energy-based diffusion models to decompose holistic human motions into reusable semantic primitives without ground-truth concept motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion modeling approaches focus on forward generation (text-to-motion) or composition, but lack inverse decomposition capabilities to extract meaningful sub-components from complex motions for reuse and recombination.

Method: Energy-based diffusion model framework that captures composed distributions of multiple motion concepts. Three training variants: DeMoGen-Exp (explicit decomposed text prompts), DeMoGen-OSS (orthogonal self-supervised decomposition), and DeMoGen-SC (semantic consistency enforcement).

Result: Successfully disentangles reusable motion primitives from complex sequences, enables flexible recombination to generate novel motions beyond training distribution, and creates a text-decomposed dataset for compositional training.

Conclusion: DeMoGen provides an effective inverse perspective to motion analysis, enabling decompositional learning that discovers semantic motion concepts without ground-truth supervision, facilitating motion reuse and novel generation.

Abstract: Human motions are compositional: complex behaviors can be described as combinations of simpler primitives. However, existing approaches primarily focus on forward modeling, e.g., learning holistic mappings from text to motion or composing a complex motion from a set of motion concepts. In this paper, we consider the inverse perspective: decomposing a holistic motion into semantically meaningful sub-components. We propose DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm for decompositional learning that employs an energy-based diffusion model. This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings. These variants enable our approach to disentangle reusable motion primitives from complex motion sequences. We also demonstrate that the decomposed motion concepts can be flexibly recombined to generate diverse and novel motions, generalizing beyond the training distribution. Additionally, we construct a text-decomposed dataset to support compositional training, serving as an extended resource to facilitate text-to-motion generation and motion composition.

*Mariya Miteva,Maria Nisheva-Pavlova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-view VAE framework for MGMT promoter methylation classification in glioblastoma using T1Gd and FLAIR MRI radiomic features


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiomics-based methods for non-invasive MGMT promoter methylation inference in glioblastoma have limitations: unimodal approaches lack complementary information, early-fusion methods suffer from high feature redundancy, and both fail to adequately model modality-specific structure.

Method: Multi-view variational autoencoder framework with independent probabilistic encoders for each MRI modality (T1Gd and FLAIR), performing fusion in a compact latent space to preserve modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration.

Result: The approach generates latent embeddings that effectively integrate complementary radiomic features from both MRI modalities for subsequent MGMT promoter methylation classification.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-view VAE framework addresses limitations of conventional radiomics methods by preserving modality-specific information while enabling effective multimodal integration for improved MGMT promoter methylation prediction in glioblastoma.

Abstract: Non-invasive inference of molecular tumor characteristics from medical imaging is a central goal of radiogenomics, particularly in glioblastoma (GBM), where O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation carries important prognostic and therapeutic significance. Although radiomics-based machine learning methods have shown promise for this task, conventional unimodal and early-fusion approaches are often limited by high feature redundancy and an incomplete modeling of modality-specific information. In this work, we introduce a multi-view latent representation learning framework based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to integrate complementary radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By encoding each modality through an independent probabilistic encoder and performing fusion in a compact latent space, the proposed approach preserves modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration. The resulting latent embeddings are subsequently used for MGMT promoter methylation classification.

*Olaide N. Oyelade,Oliver Hoxey,Yulia Humrye*

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end vision transformer pipeline for pixel-level HER2 scoring from H&E and IHC whole slide images, achieving high accuracy comparable to pathologists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for HER2 scoring lack pixel-level localization capability and struggle with joint analysis of H&E and IHC stained images, which is crucial for accurate HER2 protein expression assessment needed for cancer treatment decisions.

Method: Uses vision transformers in an end-to-end pipeline with patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization, a novel mapping function to correlate IHC regions with H&E malignant regions, and a clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scores (0, 1+, 2+, 3+).

Result: Achieved good classification accuracy for tumor localization, 0.94 classification accuracy and 0.933 specificity for 4-way HER2 status prediction, with performance comparable to human pathologists on WSI patches.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end ViT-based pipeline successfully enables joint evaluation of H&E and IHC images for accurate pixel-level HER2 scoring, demonstrating clinical applicability for automated HER2 assessment.

Abstract: The popular use of histopathology images, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), has proven to be useful in detecting tumors. However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring

TL;DR: Human-inspired pseudo-coloring technique improves ECG analysis by enhancing both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks, particularly for detecting drug-induced long QT syndrome.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine vision models for physiological signal interpretation require large datasets and lack interpretability, limiting clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. There's a need for more data-efficient and explainable approaches for medical AI.

Method: Used perception-informed pseudo-coloring technique that encodes clinically salient temporal features (like QT-interval duration) into structured color representations. Applied prototypical networks and ResNet-18 architecture for one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms.

Result: Models learned discriminative and interpretable features from as few as 1-5 training examples. Pseudo-coloring guided attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improved performance, mimicking human perceptual averaging.

Conclusion: Human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence, demonstrating that biologically inspired approaches can enhance both performance and interpretability in clinical AI applications.

Abstract: Machine vision models, particularly deep neural networks, are increasingly applied to physiological signal interpretation, including electrocardiography (ECG), yet they typically require large training datasets and offer limited insight into the causal features underlying their predictions. This lack of data efficiency and interpretability constrains their clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data.
  We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats. Together, these findings demonstrate that human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with 3D scene manipulation due to weak visual grounding, limited 3D understanding, and error-prone iterative updates. This paper introduces a multi-agent framework with MCP-based API, specialized visual tools, and role-based collaboration to enable robust 3D object arrangement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive results in 2D vision-language tasks, but their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains largely unexplored. There's a critical gap in using MLLMs for precise 3D-aware manipulation tasks like object arrangement.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) MCP-based API to shift from brittle raw code to robust function-level updates, addressing weak visual grounding; 2) Suite of specialized visual tools for scene analysis, spatial information gathering, and action validation; 3) Collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification to handle iterative, error-prone updates.

Result: The approach was evaluated on 25 complex object arrangement tasks and significantly outperformed existing baselines, demonstrating effective 3D scene manipulation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between MLLMs and complex 3D scene manipulation by addressing visual grounding, 3D understanding, and error management challenges, enabling robust object arrangement through collaborative multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in 2D vision-language tasks, their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains underexplored. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines. Website: vulcan-3d.github.io

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-E is a novel text-to-image model trained from scratch that supports any-step inference through self-evaluation, combining local learning with global matching to enable both few-step and high-quality long-step generation in a single unified model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion/flow models require many inference steps due to local supervision, while distillation approaches need pretrained teachers. There's a need for a unified model that can generate high-quality images at any step count without relying on external teachers or many inference steps.

Method: Self-E learns like Flow Matching but adds a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using current score estimates, acting as a dynamic self-teacher. This combines instantaneous local learning with self-driven global matching.

Result: Self-E excels in few-step generation and is competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. Performance improves monotonically with inference steps, enabling both ultra-fast few-step and high-quality long-trajectory sampling in one model.

Conclusion: Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model, offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation that bridges the gap between local supervision and global matching paradigms.

Abstract: We introduce the Self-Evaluating Model (Self-E), a novel, from-scratch training approach for text-to-image generation that supports any-step inference. Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model. To our knowledge, Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model, offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeFloMat is a fast generative object detection framework using Conditional Flow Matching that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in just 3 inference steps, solving the latency bottleneck of diffusion-based detectors for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based detectors like DiffusionDet suffer from critical latency bottlenecks due to their reliance on numerous sampling steps (T ≫ 60), making them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications such as Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE).

Method: DeFloMat replaces the slow stochastic denoising process of diffusion models with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport theory, specifically approximating Rectified Flow. This enables fast inference via a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver.

Result: DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (43.32% AP₁₀:₅₀) in only 3 inference steps, representing a 1.4× performance improvement over DiffusionDet's maximum converged performance (31.03% AP₁₀:₅₀ at 4 steps). It also shows superior localization characteristics, better Recall, and stability in few-step regimes.

Conclusion: DeFloMat resolves the trade-off between generative accuracy and clinical efficiency, setting a new standard for stable and rapid object localization in time-sensitive medical applications.

Abstract: We propose DeFloMat (Detection with Flow Matching), a novel generative object detection framework that addresses the critical latency bottleneck of diffusion-based detectors, such as DiffusionDet, by integrating Conditional Flow Matching (CFM). Diffusion models achieve high accuracy by formulating detection as a multi-step stochastic denoising process, but their reliance on numerous sampling steps ($T \gg 60$) makes them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications like Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE). DeFloMat replaces this slow stochastic path with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport (OT) theory, specifically approximating the Rectified Flow. This shift enables fast inference via a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. We demonstrate the superiority of DeFloMat on a challenging MRE clinical dataset. Crucially, DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy ($43.32\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$) in only $3$ inference steps, which represents a $1.4\times$ performance improvement over DiffusionDet's maximum converged performance ($31.03\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$ at $4$ steps). Furthermore, our deterministic flow significantly enhances localization characteristics, yielding superior Recall and stability in the few-step regime. DeFloMat resolves the trade-off between generative accuracy and clinical efficiency, setting a new standard for stable and rapid object localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label-free 3D brightfield microscopy is fast and noninvasive but lacks robust volumetric segmentation capabilities without fluorescence or extensive post-processing. There's a need for direct segmentation from brightfield volumes.

Method: Bright-4B learns on the unit hypersphere with Native Sparse Attention (local, coarse, selected global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections for stable representation flow, soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity, and anisotropic patch embedding respecting confocal point-spread and axial thinning.

Result: The model produces morphology-accurate segmentations of nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles from brightfield stacks alone, outperforming CNN and Transformer baselines across multiple confocal datasets while preserving fine structural detail across depth and cell types.

Conclusion: Bright-4B enables large-scale, label-free 3D cell mapping without fluorescence, auxiliary channels, or handcrafted post-processing, with all code, pretrained weights, and models for downstream finetuning being released.

Abstract: Label-free 3D brightfield microscopy offers a fast and noninvasive way to visualize cellular morphology, yet robust volumetric segmentation still typically depends on fluorescence or heavy post-processing. We address this gap by introducing Bright-4B, a 4 billion parameter foundation model that learns on the unit hypersphere to segment subcellular structures directly from 3D brightfield volumes. Bright-4B combines a hardware-aligned Native Sparse Attention mechanism (capturing local, coarse, and selected global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections that stabilize representation flow, and a soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity. A plug-and-play anisotropic patch embed further respects confocal point-spread and axial thinning, enabling geometry-faithful 3D tokenization. The resulting model produces morphology-accurate segmentations of nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles from brightfield stacks alone--without fluorescence, auxiliary channels, or handcrafted post-processing. Across multiple confocal datasets, Bright-4B preserves fine structural detail across depth and cell types, outperforming contemporary CNN and Transformer baselines. All code, pretrained weights, and models for downstream finetuning will be released to advance large-scale, label-free 3D cell mapping.

TL;DR: FluenceFormer is a transformer-based framework for radiotherapy fluence map prediction that uses a two-stage approach with physics-informed loss to address long-range dependency issues in prior convolutional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluence map prediction is an ill-posed inverse problem in radiotherapy planning. Existing convolutional methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable treatment plans.

Method: A backbone-agnostic transformer framework with two stages: Stage 1 predicts global dose prior from anatomical inputs, Stage 2 conditions this prior on explicit beam geometry to regress physically calibrated fluence maps. Uses Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR) loss integrating voxel-level fidelity, gradient smoothness, structural consistency, and beam-wise energy conservation.

Result: FluenceFormer with Swin UNETR achieves best performance among evaluated models (Swin UNETR, UNETR, nnFormer, MedFormer), reducing Energy Error to 4.5% and showing statistically significant gains in structural fidelity (p < 0.05) over existing CNN and single-stage methods.

Conclusion: FluenceFormer provides an effective transformer-based solution for fluence map prediction that addresses limitations of convolutional methods through its two-stage design and physics-informed loss function, demonstrating improved performance and physical consistency.

Abstract: Fluence map prediction is central to automated radiotherapy planning but remains an ill-posed inverse problem due to the complex relationship between volumetric anatomy and beam-intensity modulation. Convolutional methods in prior work often struggle to capture long-range dependencies, which can lead to structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable plans. We introduce \textbf{FluenceFormer}, a backbone-agnostic transformer framework for direct, geometry-aware fluence regression. The model uses a unified two-stage design: Stage~1 predicts a global dose prior from anatomical inputs, and Stage~2 conditions this prior on explicit beam geometry to regress physically calibrated fluence maps. Central to the approach is the \textbf{Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR)} loss, a physics-informed objective that integrates voxel-level fidelity, gradient smoothness, structural consistency, and beam-wise energy conservation. We evaluate the generality of the framework across multiple transformer backbones, including Swin UNETR, UNETR, nnFormer, and MedFormer, using a prostate IMRT dataset. FluenceFormer with Swin UNETR achieves the strongest performance among the evaluated models and improves over existing benchmark CNN and single-stage methods, reducing Energy Error to $\mathbf{4.5\%}$ and yielding statistically significant gains in structural fidelity ($p < 0.05$).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models ensure content consistency but lack emotional awareness, while emotion-driven models generate affective results at the cost of content distortion. There's a need for models that can generate images that are both content-faithful and emotionally expressive.

Method: Propose EmoCtrl framework with dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts. Incorporates textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues. Uses learned emotion tokens that exhibit complementary effects.

Result: EmoCtrl achieves faithful content and expressive emotion control, outperforming existing methods across multiple aspects. User studies confirm strong alignment with human preference. Generalizes well to creative applications, demonstrating robustness and adaptability of learned emotion tokens.

Conclusion: EmoCtrl successfully addresses the gap between content-faithful and emotionally expressive image generation, providing a controllable framework for emotional image content generation that aligns with human perception and preferences.

Abstract: An image conveys meaning through both its visual content and emotional tone, jointly shaping human perception. We introduce Controllable Emotional Image Content Generation (C-EICG), which aims to generate images that remain faithful to a given content description while expressing a target emotion. Existing text-to-image models ensure content consistency but lack emotional awareness, whereas emotion-driven models generate affective results at the cost of content distortion. To address this gap, we propose EmoCtrl, supported by a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts, bridging abstract emotions to visual cues. EmoCtrl incorporates textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues. The learned emotion tokens exhibit complementary effects, as demonstrated through ablations and visualizations. Quantatitive and qualatitive experiments demonstrate that EmoCtrl achieves faithful content and expressive emotion control, outperforming existing methods across multiple aspects. User studies confirm EmoCtrl's strong alignment with human preference.

*Khalfalla Awedat,Mohamed Abidalrekab,Gurcan Comert,Mustafa Ayad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperiorGAT uses graph attention networks to reconstruct missing elevation data in sparse LiDAR point clouds caused by beam dropout, achieving better accuracy than existing methods without increasing computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR perception in autonomous systems faces limitations due to fixed vertical beam resolution and beam dropout from environmental occlusions, which degrade point cloud quality and compromise perception accuracy.

Method: SuperiorGAT models LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and uses graph attention networks with gated residual fusion and feed-forward refinement to reconstruct missing elevation information without increasing network depth.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI datasets show SuperiorGAT achieves lower reconstruction error and better geometric consistency than PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines, with minimal vertical distortion in X-Z projections.

Conclusion: Architectural refinement through SuperiorGAT offers a computationally efficient way to improve LiDAR resolution without requiring additional sensor hardware, enhancing perception capabilities in autonomous systems.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in autonomous systems is constrained by fixed vertical beam resolution and further compromised by beam dropout resulting from environmental occlusions. This paper introduces SuperiorGAT, a graph attention-based framework designed to reconstruct missing elevation information in sparse LiDAR point clouds. By modeling LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and incorporating gated residual fusion with feed-forward refinement, SuperiorGAT enables accurate reconstruction without increasing network depth. To evaluate performance, structured beam dropout is simulated by removing every fourth vertical scanning beam. Extensive experiments across diverse KITTI environments, including Person, Road, Campus, and City sequences, demonstrate that SuperiorGAT consistently achieves lower reconstruction error and improved geometric consistency compared to PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines. Qualitative X-Z projections further confirm the model's ability to preserve structural integrity with minimal vertical distortion. These results suggest that architectural refinement offers a computationally efficient method for improving LiDAR resolution without requiring additional sensor hardware.

*Zibin Liu,Banglei Guana,Yang Shanga,Zhenbao Yu,Yifei Bian,Qifeng Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A line-based event camera calibration method that uses geometric lines from common objects instead of traditional calibration patterns, enabling faster calibration in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current event camera calibration methods are time-consuming, require manual placement of calibration objects, and cannot adapt to rapidly changing scenarios. There's a need for more flexible and efficient calibration approaches.

Method: Proposes a framework that detects lines directly from event streams using geometric lines from common man-made objects (doors, windows, boxes). Uses an event-line calibration model to generate initial camera parameter estimates, then refines them through non-linear optimization. Works with both planar and non-planar lines.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the method's feasibility and accuracy. Validation performed on both monocular and stereo event cameras.

Conclusion: The proposed line-based calibration method provides an efficient alternative to traditional event camera calibration, eliminating the need for manual calibration patterns and enabling faster adaptation to changing environments.

Abstract: Camera calibration is an essential prerequisite for event-based vision applications. Current event camera calibration methods typically involve using flashing patterns, reconstructing intensity images, and utilizing the features extracted from events. Existing methods are generally time-consuming and require manually placed calibration objects, which cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a line-based event camera calibration framework exploiting the geometric lines of commonly-encountered objects in man-made environments, e.g., doors, windows, boxes, etc. Different from previous methods, our method detects lines directly from event streams and leverages an event-line calibration model to generate the initial guess of camera parameters, which is suitable for both planar and non-planar lines. Then, a non-linear optimization is adopted to refine camera parameters. Both simulation and real-world experiments have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of our method, with validation performed on monocular and stereo event cameras.

*Zhicheng Zhao,Yuancheng Xu,Andong Lu,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QDFNet: A quality-aware dynamic fusion network for robust optical-SAR object detection that handles missing modalities through learnable reference tokens and orthogonal constraint fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical-SAR fusion for object detection faces practical limitations due to temporal asynchrony, registration difficulties, and frequent missing/degraded modality data. Existing methods lack robustness to random missing modalities and consistent performance improvement mechanisms.

Method: Proposes QDFNet with two key modules: 1) Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) using learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment and identify degraded regions, and 2) Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) that preserves modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores.

Result: Extensive experiments on SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate QDFNet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, especially under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.

Conclusion: QDFNet effectively addresses optical-SAR fusion challenges by dynamically assessing feature reliability and adaptively fusing modalities, providing robust object detection performance even with missing or degraded data.

Abstract: Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) fusion-based object detection has attracted significant research interest in remote sensing, as these modalities provide complementary information for all-weather monitoring. However, practical deployment is severely limited by inherent challenges. Due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, obtaining well-aligned optical-SAR image pairs remains extremely difficult, frequently resulting in missing or degraded modality data. Although recent approaches have attempted to address this issue, they still suffer from limited robustness to random missing modalities and lack effective mechanisms to ensure consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) for robust optical-SAR object detection. Our proposed method leverages learnable reference tokens to dynamically assess feature reliability and guide adaptive fusion in the presence of missing modalities. In particular, we design a Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) module that employs learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment, enabling precise identification of degraded regions and providing quality guidance for subsequent fusion. Moreover, we develop an Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) module that employs orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores, effectively suppressing unreliable feature propagation. Extensive experiments on the SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of QDFNet compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.

*Md Abu Obaida Zishan,Annajiat Alim Rasel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SonoVision is a smartphone app that helps visually impaired people locate everyday objects using directional sound cues through headphones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in locating objects, which hinders their independence and can lead to dangerous situations. The goal is to make visually challenged people more self-sufficient by reducing their reliance on others.

Method: Built with Flutter development platform, uses Efficientdet-D2 model for object detection. Provides directional sound cues through headphones: sinusoidal sound in right/left ear for objects on respective sides, simultaneous sound in both ears for objects directly in front.

Result: Developed a fully functional smartphone application that works completely offline, enabling visually impaired users to locate objects independently using audio cues.

Conclusion: SonoVision significantly assists visually impaired individuals in a safe, user-friendly manner by providing object location information through intuitive sound cues, promoting greater independence.

Abstract: Locating objects for the visually impaired is a significant challenge and is something no one can get used to over time. However, this hinders their independence and could push them towards risky and dangerous scenarios. Hence, in the spirit of making the visually challenged more self-sufficient, we present SonoVision, a smart-phone application that helps them find everyday objects using sound cues through earphones/headphones. This simply means, if an object is on the right or left side of a user, the app makes a sinusoidal sound in a user's respective ear through ear/headphones. However, to indicate objects located directly in front, both the left and right earphones are rung simultaneously. These sound cues could easily help a visually impaired individual locate objects with the help of their smartphones and reduce the reliance on people in their surroundings, consequently making them more independent. This application is made with the flutter development platform and uses the Efficientdet-D2 model for object detection in the backend. We believe the app will significantly assist the visually impaired in a safe and user-friendly manner with its capacity to work completely offline.

Abstract: Monocular 3D building reconstruction from remote sensing imagery is essential for scalable urban modeling, yet existing methods often require task-specific architectures and intensive supervision. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of SAM 3D, a general-purpose image-to-3D foundation model, for monocular remote sensing building reconstruction. We benchmark SAM 3D against TRELLIS on samples from the NYC Urban Dataset, employing Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) as evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM 3D produces more coherent roof geometry and sharper boundaries compared to TRELLIS. We further extend SAM 3D to urban scene reconstruction through a segment-reconstruct-compose pipeline, demonstrating its potential for urban scene modeling. We also analyze practical limitations and discuss future research directions. These findings provide practical guidance for deploying foundation models in urban 3D reconstruction and motivate future integration of scene-level structural priors.

*Haley Mody,Namish Bansal,Dennies Kiprono Bor,Edward J. Oughton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares three computer vision models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) for autonomous detection and mapping of electrical substation components to improve grid vulnerability assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electrical substations are critical infrastructure vulnerable to various hazards, but traditional manual mapping is time-consuming and labor-intensive. An autonomous computer vision solution is needed for efficient vulnerability assessment and failure prevention.

Method: The researchers trained and compared three object detection models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images. They evaluated each model based on detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency metrics.

Result: The paper presents comparative performance analysis of the three models, identifying their key strengths and limitations for substation component detection. The models were successfully applied to map various substation components across the United States.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the feasibility of using computer vision models for large-scale, autonomous substation component mapping, providing a more efficient alternative to manual methods for critical infrastructure vulnerability assessment.

Abstract: Electrical substations are a significant component of an electrical grid. Indeed, the assets at these substations (e.g., transformers) are prone to disruption from many hazards, including hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). As electrical grids are considered critical national infrastructure, any failure can have significant economic and public safety implications. To help prevent and mitigate these failures, it is thus essential that we identify key substation components to quantify vulnerability. Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency. In this research paper, we train and compare the outputs of 3 models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images. Each model is evaluated for detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency. We present the key strengths and limitations of each model, identifying which provides reliable and large-scale substation component mapping. Additionally, we utilize these models to effectively map the various substation components in the United States, showcasing a use case for machine learning in substation mapping.

*Sukhyun Jeong,Yong-Hoon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGR²M introduces a hybrid motion representation combining interpretable pose codes with residual codes to improve text-based 3D motion generation and editing by capturing both global structure and fine-grained temporal details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose-code-based frameworks like CoMo struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details due to their frame-wise representation, which degrades reconstruction fidelity and local controllability in text-based motion generation and editing.

Method: A hybrid representation combining pose codes (for coarse global structure) with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). Uses a pose-guided RVQ tokenizer, residual dropout to prevent over-reliance on residuals, and a two-stage Transformer architecture: a base Transformer for pose codes and a refine Transformer for residual codes.

Result: PGR²M improves Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets compared to CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines. User studies confirm it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.

Conclusion: The hybrid pose+residual representation effectively addresses limitations of pure pose-code frameworks, achieving better motion quality and editability while maintaining interpretable control for text-based motion generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Text-based 3D motion generation aims to automatically synthesize diverse motions from natural-language descriptions to extend user creativity, whereas motion editing modifies an existing motion sequence in response to text while preserving its overall structure. Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using multiple event cameras achieves high-precision measurement of shock wave motion parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling multi-angle measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: The method achieves maximum error of 5.20% and minimum error of 0.06% compared to pressure sensors and empirical formulas, demonstrating high-precision measurement of shock wave motion field with both high spatial and temporal resolution.

Conclusion: The proposed event camera-based framework represents significant progress in shock wave measurement, enabling accurate multi-angle measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion with high spatiotemporal resolution.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of shock wave motion parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution is essential for applications such as power field testing and damage assessment. However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-precision measurement of the shock wave motion field with both high spatial and temporal resolution, representing significant progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small object detection requires expensive annotations, creating a need for semi-supervised approaches. Existing methods like SAM face domain gaps, lack physical priors encoding, and have architectural complexity.

Method: Two-stage paradigm: 1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation using hierarchical MoE adapter with 10% supervised data to distill SAM into Scalpel-SAM; 2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer using Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight downstream models.

Result: With minimal annotations, downstream models achieve performance comparable to or surpassing fully supervised counterparts. First semi-supervised paradigm systematically addressing IR-SOT data scarcity using SAM as teacher.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical MoE adapter and two-stage knowledge distillation/transfer paradigm effectively addresses annotation scarcity in infrared small object detection, enabling efficient deployment with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Infrared small object detection urgently requires semi-supervised paradigms due to the high cost of annotation. However, existing methods like SAM face significant challenges of domain gaps, inability of encoding physical priors, and inherent architectural complexity. To address this, we designed a Hierarchical MoE Adapter consisting of four white-box neural operators. Building upon this core component, we propose a two-stage paradigm for knowledge distillation and transfer: (1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation, where we use our MoE adapter and 10% of available fully supervised data to distill SAM into an expert teacher (Scalpel-SAM); and (2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer, where we use Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight and efficient downstream models. Experiments demonstrate that with minimal annotations, our paradigm enables downstream models to achieve performance comparable to, or even surpassing, their fully supervised counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised paradigm that systematically addresses the data scarcity issue in IR-SOT using SAM as the teacher model.

*Tanish Baranwal,Himanshu Gaurav Singh,Jathushan Rajasegaran,Jitendra Malik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-GMAE is a self-supervised video representation learning method that encodes video frames as moving Gaussian splats, enabling emergent tracking capabilities and achieving state-of-the-art performance on video understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a self-supervised video representation learning approach that leverages the natural 3D structure of dynamic scenes. The key insight is that 2D videos are often projections of 3D scenes, so representing videos as moving 3D Gaussians provides a reasonable inductive bias for learning meaningful representations.

Method: Video-GMAE uses a masked autoencoder architecture that encodes video frames into a set of Gaussian splats that move over time. The model learns to reconstruct masked video patches by predicting the parameters of these 3D Gaussians. This representation naturally encourages the network to learn object tracking as the Gaussians follow scene elements through time.

Result: The method demonstrates emergent tracking capabilities - mapping Gaussian trajectories to the image plane achieves zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. After fine-tuning, Video-GMAE achieves 34.6% improvement on Kinetics and 13.1% improvement on Kubric datasets, surpassing existing self-supervised video approaches.

Conclusion: Representing videos as moving 3D Gaussians provides an effective inductive bias for self-supervised video representation learning, enabling emergent tracking capabilities and achieving superior performance on video understanding tasks compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We propose Video Gaussian Masked Autoencoders (Video-GMAE), a self-supervised approach for representation learning that encodes a sequence of images into a set of Gaussian splats moving over time. Representing a video as a set of Gaussians enforces a reasonable inductive bias: that 2-D videos are often consistent projections of a dynamic 3-D scene. We find that tracking emerges when pretraining a network with this architecture. Mapping the trajectory of the learnt Gaussians onto the image plane gives zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art. With small-scale finetuning, our models achieve 34.6% improvement on Kinetics, and 13.1% on Kubric datasets, surpassing existing self-supervised video approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal 3D perception methods for autonomous driving fail in lunar environments due to poor feature alignment, limited multimodal synergy, and weak small object detection capabilities needed for meteor fragments and rocks.

Method: Built on BEVFusion framework with four key components: Cognitive Adapter for camera backbone tuning, Contrastive Alignment Module for camera-LiDAR feature consistency, Camera Auxiliary Training Branch for visual representation, and Section-aware Coordinate Attention for small irregular targets.

Result: Achieves 69.7% mAP and 72.1% NDS on nuScenes validation set (5.0% and 2.7% improvement over baseline). In simulated lunar environments, achieves 90.93% mAP (11.5% improvement) with notable gains in detecting small meteor-like obstacles.

Conclusion: SCAFusion effectively addresses lunar environment challenges with minimal parameter/computation overhead, demonstrating superior performance for small, irregular object detection critical for autonomous lunar exploration.

Abstract: Reliable and precise detection of small and irregular objects, such as meteor fragments and rocks, is critical for autonomous navigation and operation in lunar surface exploration. Existing multimodal 3D perception methods designed for terrestrial autonomous driving often underperform in off world environments due to poor feature alignment, limited multimodal synergy, and weak small object detection. This paper presents SCAFusion, a multimodal 3D object detection model tailored for lunar robotic missions. Built upon the BEVFusion framework, SCAFusion integrates a Cognitive Adapter for efficient camera backbone tuning, a Contrastive Alignment Module to enhance camera LiDAR feature consistency, a Camera Auxiliary Training Branch to strengthen visual representation, and most importantly, a Section aware Coordinate Attention mechanism explicitly designed to boost the detection performance of small, irregular targets. With negligible increase in parameters and computation, our model achieves 69.7% mAP and 72.1% NDS on the nuScenes validation set, improving the baseline by 5.0% and 2.7%, respectively. In simulated lunar environments built on Isaac Sim, SCAFusion achieves 90.93% mAP, outperforming the baseline by 11.5%, with notable gains in detecting small meteor like obstacles.

TL;DR: DreamOmni3 introduces scribble-based editing and generation tasks using multimodal inputs (text, images, sketches) with a novel joint input scheme that avoids binary masks for better handling complex edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text prompts alone often fail to capture precise edit locations and fine-grained visual details in image editing/generation. There's a need for more flexible creation tools that combine textual, image, and freehand sketch inputs on graphical interfaces.

Method: 1) Creates two data synthesis pipelines: scribble-based editing (4 tasks) and scribble-based generation (3 tasks) using DreamOmni2 dataset with overlays of hand-drawn elements. 2) Proposes a joint input scheme that feeds both original and scribbled source images with different colors to distinguish regions, using same index and position encodings for precise localization.

Result: DreamOmni3 achieves outstanding performance on comprehensive benchmarks for scribble-based editing and generation tasks. Models and code will be publicly released.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables more flexible image creation by combining textual, image, and sketch inputs, addressing limitations of text-only prompts. The joint input scheme effectively handles complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions.

Abstract: Recently unified generation and editing models have achieved remarkable success with their impressive performance. These models rely mainly on text prompts for instruction-based editing and generation, but language often fails to capture users intended edit locations and fine-grained visual details. To this end, we propose two tasks: scribble-based editing and generation, that enables more flexible creation on graphical user interface (GUI) combining user textual, images, and freehand sketches. We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation. For scribble-based editing, we define four tasks: scribble and instruction-based editing, scribble and multimodal instruction-based editing, image fusion, and doodle editing. Based on DreamOmni2 dataset, we extract editable regions and overlay hand-drawn boxes, circles, doodles or cropped image to construct training data. For scribble-based generation, we define three tasks: scribble and instruction-based generation, scribble and multimodal instruction-based generation, and doodle generation, following similar data creation pipelines. For the framework, instead of using binary masks, which struggle with complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions, we propose a joint input scheme that feeds both the original and scribbled source images into the model, using different colors to distinguish regions and simplify processing. By applying the same index and position encodings to both images, the model can precisely localize scribbled regions while maintaining accurate editing. Finally, we establish comprehensive benchmarks for these tasks to promote further research. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamOmni3 achieves outstanding performance, and models and code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: CoAgent is a collaborative closed-loop framework for coherent video generation that addresses identity drift and scene inconsistency through a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline with global context management and visual consistency control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video models treat each shot independently, leading to identity drift, scene inconsistency, and unstable temporal structure in open-domain video generation.

Method: CoAgent uses a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline: Storyboard Planner decomposes prompts into shot-level plans, Global Context Manager maintains entity memory, Synthesis Module generates shots with Visual Consistency Controller, Verifier Agent detects inconsistencies, and pacing-aware editor refines temporal flow.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate CoAgent significantly improves coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long-form video generation compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CoAgent's collaborative closed-loop framework effectively addresses narrative coherence and visual consistency challenges in open-domain video generation through systematic planning, context management, and verification mechanisms.

Abstract: Maintaining narrative coherence and visual consistency remains a central challenge in open-domain video generation. Existing text-to-video models often treat each shot independently, resulting in identity drift, scene inconsistency, and unstable temporal structure. We propose CoAgent, a collaborative and closed-loop framework for coherent video generation that formulates the process as a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline. Given a user prompt, style reference, and pacing constraints, a Storyboard Planner decomposes the input into structured shot-level plans with explicit entities, spatial relations, and temporal cues. A Global Context Manager maintains entity-level memory to preserve appearance and identity consistency across shots. Each shot is then generated by a Synthesis Module under the guidance of a Visual Consistency Controller, while a Verifier Agent evaluates intermediate results using vision-language reasoning and triggers selective regeneration when inconsistencies are detected. Finally, a pacing-aware editor refines temporal rhythm and transitions to match the desired narrative flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoAgent significantly improves coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long-form video generation.

TL;DR: SR-MCR is a lightweight, label-free framework that improves multimodal LLM reasoning reliability by using self-referential cues from model outputs to align intermediate reasoning steps, achieving state-of-the-art performance on visual benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs produce unreliable reasoning with weak step-to-step coherence and insufficient visual grounding because existing alignment approaches only supervise final answers while ignoring intermediate reasoning reliability.

Method: SR-MCR uses five self-referential cues (semantic alignment, lexical fidelity, non-redundancy, visual grounding, step consistency) to create a normalized reliability-weighted reward for fine-grained process-level guidance. It employs a critic-free GRPO objective with confidence-aware cooling mechanism to stabilize training and suppress trivial/overconfident generations.

Result: Built on Qwen2.5-VL, SR-MCR improves both answer accuracy and reasoning coherence across visual benchmarks. SR-MCR-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models of comparable size with 81.4% average accuracy. Ablation studies confirm contributions of each reward term and cooling module.

Conclusion: SR-MCR provides an effective label-free framework for aligning multimodal LLM reasoning by exploiting intrinsic process signals, addressing the gap in intermediate reasoning supervision and achieving improved reliability and performance.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs often produce fluent yet unreliable reasoning, exhibiting weak step-to-step coherence and insufficient visual grounding, largely because existing alignment approaches supervise only the final answer while ignoring the reliability of the intermediate reasoning process. We introduce SR-MCR, a lightweight and label-free framework that aligns reasoning by exploiting intrinsic process signals derived directly from model outputs. Five self-referential cues -- semantic alignment, lexical fidelity, non-redundancy, visual grounding, and step consistency -- are integrated into a normalized, reliability-weighted reward that provides fine-grained process-level guidance. A critic-free GRPO objective, enhanced with a confidence-aware cooling mechanism, further stabilizes training and suppresses trivial or overly confident generations. Built on Qwen2.5-VL, SR-MCR improves both answer accuracy and reasoning coherence across a broad set of visual benchmarks; among open-source models of comparable size, SR-MCR-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 81.4%. Ablation studies confirm the independent contributions of each reward term and the cooling module.

Conclusion: The proposed ReFRM3D network with radiomics enhancement significantly improves glioma segmentation and classification performance, addressing key challenges in brain tumor characterization.

Abstract: Gliomas are among the most aggressive cancers, characterized by high mortality rates and complex diagnostic processes. Existing studies on glioma diagnosis and classification often describe issues such as high variability in imaging data, inadequate optimization of computational resources, and inefficient segmentation and classification of gliomas. To address these challenges, we propose novel techniques utilizing multi-parametric MRI data to enhance tumor segmentation and classification efficiency. Our work introduces the first-ever radiomics-enhanced fused residual multiparametric 3D network (ReFRM3D) for brain tumor characterization, which is based on a 3D U-Net architecture and features multi-scale feature fusion, hybrid upsampling, and an extended residual skip mechanism. Additionally, we propose a multi-feature tumor marker-based classifier that leverages radiomic features extracted from the segmented regions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance across the BraTS2019, BraTS2020, and BraTS2021 datasets, achieving high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 94.04%, 92.68%, and 93.64% for whole tumor (WT), enhancing tumor (ET), and tumor core (TC) respectively in BraTS2019; 94.09%, 92.91%, and 93.84% in BraTS2020; and 93.70%, 90.36%, and 92.13% in BraTS2021.

*Marwan Taher,Ignacio Alzugaray,Kirill Mazur,Xin Kong,Andrew J. Davison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Tracker enables real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction from monocular RGB videos by caching attention KV pairs from multi-view geometry networks, achieving 15× speedup and ~27 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view 3D geometry networks provide strong priors but are too slow for real-time applications. There's a need to adapt these powerful networks for online use in pose tracking and reconstruction tasks.

Method: The method selects/manages keyframes for scene mapping via π³ with bidirectional attention, then caches the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This caching strategy is model-agnostic and doesn't require retraining.

Result: Achieves up to 15× speedup during inference without drift or catastrophic forgetting, maintains high frame-rates up to ~27 FPS, and demonstrates strong performance on TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic, and OnePose datasets for both scene-level and object tracking/reconstruction.

Conclusion: KV-Tracker successfully adapts powerful but slow multi-view geometry networks for real-time applications by leveraging cached attention KV pairs, enabling efficient online pose tracking and reconstruction from monocular RGB videos without depth or object priors.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D geometry networks offer a powerful prior but are prohibitively slow for real-time applications. We propose a novel way to adapt them for online use, enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction of objects and scenes from monocular RGB videos. Our method rapidly selects and manages a set of images as keyframes to map a scene or object via $π^3$ with full bidirectional attention. We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining. We demonstrate KV-Tracker on both scene-level tracking and the more challenging task of on-the-fly object tracking and reconstruction without depth measurements or object priors. Experiments on the TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic and OnePose datasets show the strong performance of our system while maintaining high frame-rates up to ${\sim}27$ FPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTalker: A novel framework for personalized 3D talking head animation that preserves individual speaking styles through style-content disentanglement and improves lip-sync accuracy via three-level audio-mesh alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech-driven 3D talking head generation methods focus on lip-sync accuracy but overlook individual speaking style nuances, limiting personalization and realism. The paper aims to address this gap by creating more personalized and realistic animations.

Method: PTalker uses style-content disentanglement from audio and facial motion sequences with disentanglement constraints. It employs a three-level modality alignment mechanism: spatial alignment using Graph Attention Networks for mesh structure, temporal alignment using cross-attention for synchronization, and feature alignment with top-k bidirectional contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show PTalker effectively generates realistic, stylized 3D talking heads that accurately match identity-specific speaking styles, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PTalker successfully addresses the limitation of existing methods by preserving individual speaking styles while maintaining high lip-synchronization accuracy, advancing personalized 3D talking head animation.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D talking head generation aims to produce lifelike facial animations precisely synchronized with speech. While considerable progress has been made in achieving high lip-synchronization accuracy, existing methods largely overlook the intricate nuances of individual speaking styles, which limits personalization and realism. In this work, we present a novel framework for personalized 3D talking head animation, namely "PTalker". This framework preserves speaking style through style disentanglement from audio and facial motion sequences and enhances lip-synchronization accuracy through a three-level alignment mechanism between audio and mesh modalities. Specifically, to effectively disentangle style and content, we design disentanglement constraints that encode driven audio and motion sequences into distinct style and content spaces to enhance speaking style representation. To improve lip-synchronization accuracy, we adopt a modality alignment mechanism incorporating three aspects: spatial alignment using Graph Attention Networks to capture vertex connectivity in the 3D mesh structure, temporal alignment using cross-attention to capture and synchronize temporal dependencies, and feature alignment by top-k bidirectional contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints to ensure consistency between speech and mesh modalities. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that PTalker effectively generates realistic, stylized 3D talking heads that accurately match identity-specific speaking styles, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

*Dafeng Zhang,Yongqi Song,Shizhuo Liu*

TL;DR: Proposes SDT (Sparse Differential Transformer) with prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity for face clustering, achieving SOTA performance by enhancing neighbor purity and reducing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face clustering methods using Jaccard similarity introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. Vanilla Transformers also introduce noise by overemphasizing irrelevant feature relationships.

Method: 1) Prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient to enhance neighbor purity; 2) Transformer-based prediction model to examine relationships near Top-K; 3) Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT) instead of vanilla Transformer to eliminate noise and enhance anti-noise capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets (including MS-Celeb-1M) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods and providing more robust face clustering.

Conclusion: The proposed SDT with prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity effectively addresses noise issues in face clustering, achieving superior performance through enhanced neighbor purity and reliable similarity estimation.

Abstract: The method used to measure relationships between face embeddings plays a crucial role in determining the performance of face clustering. Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, such as MS-Celeb-1M, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming existing methods and providing a more robust solution for face clustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive VLMs have limitations in complex visual planning and robotic control due to sequential generation. The authors investigate diffusion-based LLMs as a better foundation for these tasks.

Method: Develop Dream-VL as a diffusion-based VLM using dLLMs, then extend to Dream-VLA through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. Leverages bidirectional nature of diffusion for action chunking and parallel generation.

Result: Dream-VL achieves SOTA among dVLMs, comparable to top AR-based VLMs on benchmarks but superior on visual planning. Dream-VLA achieves 97.2% on LIBERO, 71.4% on SimplerEnv-Bridge, 60.5% on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models like π₀ and GR00T-N1.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based VLMs/VLAs offer superior performance for visual planning and robotic control tasks compared to autoregressive approaches, with faster convergence and better action generation capabilities.

Abstract: While autoregressive Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their sequential generation often limits their efficacy in complex visual planning and dynamic robotic control. In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1. We also validate that dVLMs surpass AR baselines on downstream tasks across different training objectives. We release both Dream-VL and Dream-VLA to facilitate further research in the community.

*Mohamad Alansari,Muzammal Naseer,Hasan Al Marzouqi,Naoufel Werghi,Sajid Javed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic study of memory mechanisms in SAM-based visual object tracking, analyzing SAM2 trackers, transferring to SAM3, and proposing a unified hybrid memory framework that improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based tracking methods address memory limitations in method-specific ways, leaving broader design principles poorly understood. Also unclear how memory mechanisms transfer to next-generation models like SAM3.

Method: 1) Analyze representative SAM2-based trackers to identify common patterns; 2) Reimplement memory mechanisms within SAM3 framework; 3) Conduct large-scale evaluations across 10 benchmarks; 4) Propose unified hybrid memory framework with explicit decomposition into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory.

Result: Analysis shows most SAM2 trackers differ mainly in short-term memory frame selection while sharing common object-centric representation. The proposed hybrid memory framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

Conclusion: Memory design principles are crucial for SAM-based tracking, and the proposed unified hybrid memory framework provides modular, principled approach that enhances robustness across challenging scenarios, with benefits transferable to next-generation foundation models.

Abstract: \noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Envision: A two-stage diffusion framework for embodied visual planning that generates goal-constrained video trajectories by first synthesizing a goal image and then interpolating between start and goal states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models for embodied visual planning are forward predictive without explicit goal modeling, leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. There's a need for goal-constrained trajectory generation that ensures physical plausibility and goal consistency.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between scene and instruction, and synthesizes coherent goal image; 2) Env-Goal Video Model (built on FL2V - first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion) interpolates between initial observation and goal image to produce smooth, physically plausible video trajectories.

Result: Superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks. The visual plans can directly support downstream robotic planning and control.

Conclusion: Envision addresses key limitations of forward predictive approaches by explicitly constraining generation with goal images, enabling reliable visual planning for embodied agents with improved goal consistency and physical plausibility.

Abstract: Embodied visual planning aims to enable manipulation tasks by imagining how a scene evolves toward a desired goal and using the imagined trajectories to guide actions. Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome. Then, an Env-Goal Video Model, built upon a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V), interpolates between the initial observation and the goal image, producing smooth and physically plausible video trajectories that connect the start and goal states. Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks demonstrate that Envision achieves superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines. The resulting visual plans can directly support downstream robotic planning and control, providing reliable guidance for embodied agents.

TL;DR: Proposes FinPercep-RM (fine-grained perceptual reward model) with perceptual degradation maps and co-evolutionary curriculum learning to address reward hacking in RLHF for image super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IQA models output only global scores, insensitive to local distortions, causing ISR models to produce artifacts that get spurious high scores (reward hacking), misaligning optimization with perceptual quality.

Method: 1) FinPercep-RM: Encoder-decoder architecture providing both global quality score and perceptual degradation map for spatial localization of defects. 2) FGR-30k dataset with diverse distortions for training. 3) Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL): synchronized curricula where reward model complexity increases while ISR model starts with simpler global reward, gradually transitioning to complex outputs.

Result: Method effectively addresses reward hacking, improves both global quality and local realism across ISR models in RLHF methods, enabling stable training.

Conclusion: Fine-grained perceptual reward modeling with synchronized curriculum learning successfully suppresses reward hacking and aligns RLHF optimization with true perceptual quality in image super-resolution.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in image generation field guided by reward models to align human preferences. Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking. Experiments validates the effectiveness of our method across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual LVEF assessment from echocardiograms is time-consuming and has high inter-observer variability. Deep learning offers potential for automated, expert-level performance in cardiac function evaluation.

Method: Investigated multiple deep learning architectures (3D Inception, two-stream, CNN-RNN) for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos. Systematically evaluated architectural modifications and fusion strategies on EchoNet-Dynamic dataset (10,030 videos).

Result: Modified 3D Inception architectures achieved best performance with RMSE of 6.79%. Found tendency toward overfitting, with smaller/simpler models showing better generalization. Performance highly sensitive to hyperparameters (kernel sizes, normalization strategies).

Conclusion: Deep learning can effectively automate LVEF estimation from echocardiography. Architectural insights from this study may generalize to other medical and non-medical video analysis tasks.

Abstract: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a key indicator of cardiac function and plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies. While this study focuses on echocardiography-based LVEF estimation, the insights gained regarding architectural design and training strategies may be applicable to a broader range of medical and non-medical video analysis tasks.

Conclusion: CLAdapter effectively unleashes the potential of foundation vision models through adaptive transfer, enabling models to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets and adapt from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios.

Abstract: In the big data era, the computer vision field benefits from large-scale datasets such as LAION-2B, LAION-400M, and ImageNet-21K, Kinetics, on which popular models like the ViT and ConvNeXt series have been pre-trained, acquiring substantial knowledge. However, numerous downstream tasks in specialized and data-limited scientific domains continue to pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Cluster Attention Adapter (CLAdapter), which refines and adapts the rich representations learned from large-scale data to various data-limited downstream tasks. Specifically, CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize the enhancement of transformed features through distribution correlation and transformation matrices. This enables models fine-tuned with CLAdapter to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets, facilitating the models' adaptation from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios effectively. In addition, CLAdapter's unified interface design allows for seamless integration with multiple model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers, in both 2D and 3D contexts.

Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models have high visual fidelity but often fail to maintain semantic alignment with complex prompts, needing better prompt consistency.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) CritiCore module uses vision-language and large language models for semantic feedback to guide diffusion, 2) SpecFusion merges intermediate states in spectral domain to preserve structure and details.

Result: Improves human-aligned metrics for text-to-image correspondence and visual quality, matches state-of-the-art reward optimization approaches, and shows superior detail, realism, and prompt fidelity.

Conclusion: CritiFusion effectively enhances semantic alignment and visual quality through semantic critique and spectral refinement, working as a plug-in module for existing diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity but often struggle with semantic alignment to complex prompts. We introduce CritiFusion, a novel inference-time framework that integrates a multimodal semantic critique mechanism with frequency-domain refinement to improve text-to-image consistency and detail. The proposed CritiCore module leverages a vision-language model and multiple large language models to enrich the prompt context and produce high-level semantic feedback, guiding the diffusion process to better align generated content with the prompt's intent. Additionally, SpecFusion merges intermediate generation states in the spectral domain, injecting coarse structural information while preserving high-frequency details. No additional model training is required. CritiFusion serves as a plug-in refinement stage compatible with existing diffusion backbones. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our method notably improves human-aligned metrics of text-to-image correspondence and visual quality. CritiFusion consistently boosts performance on human preference scores and aesthetic evaluations, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art reward optimization approaches. Qualitative results further demonstrate superior detail, realism, and prompt fidelity, indicating the effectiveness of our semantic critique and spectral alignment strategy.

Abstract: Motion prediction has been studied in different contexts with models trained on narrow distributions and applied to downstream tasks in human motion prediction and robotics. Simultaneously, recent efforts in scaling video prediction have demonstrated impressive visual realism, yet they struggle to accurately model complex motions despite massive scale. Inspired by the scaling of video generation, we develop autoregressive flow matching (ARFM), a new method for probabilistic modeling of sequential continuous data and train it on diverse video datasets to generate future point track locations over long horizons. To evaluate our model, we develop benchmarks for evaluating the ability of motion prediction models to predict human and robot motion. Our model is able to predict complex motions, and we demonstrate that conditioning robot action prediction and human motion prediction on predicted future tracks can significantly improve downstream task performance.

*Salvador Rodriguez-Sanz,Monica Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal diffeomorphic registration using Neural ODEs with structural descriptors for instance-specific, training-free registration across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing nonrigid registration methods face tradeoffs between accuracy, computational complexity, and regularization. They also assume intensity correlation in homologous regions, limiting them to monomodal settings. Learning-based models require extensive training data and suffer performance degradation on unseen modalities.

Method: Proposes an instance-specific framework using Neural ODEs (continuous-depth networks) with structural descriptors as modality-agnostic metrics. Three variants integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors with nonstructural image similarities computed by local mutual information.

Result: Surpassing qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art baselines for both large and small deformations in multimodal registration. Shows robustness to varying regularization levels, suitability for registration at varying scales, and efficiency compared to other large-deformation methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Neural ODE-based multimodal registration framework provides accurate, efficient, and robust registration without requiring extensive training data, making it suitable for diverse multimodal applications with varying deformation scales.

Abstract: This work proposes a multimodal diffeomorphic registration method using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Nonrigid registration algorithms exhibit tradeoffs between their accuracy, the computational complexity of their deformation model, and its proper regularization. In addition, they also assume intensity correlation in anatomically homologous regions of interest among image pairs, limiting their applicability to the monomodal setting. Unlike learning-based models, we propose an instance-specific framework that is not subject to high scan requirements for training and does not suffer performance degradation at inference time on modalities unseen during training. Our method exploits the potential of continuous-depth networks in the Neural ODE paradigm with structural descriptors, widely adopted as modality-agnostic metric models which exploit self-similarities on parameterized neighborhood geometries. We propose three different variants that integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors and nonstructural image similarities computed by local mutual information. We conduct extensive evaluations on different experiments formed by scan dataset combinations and show surpassing qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art baselines adequate for large or small deformations, and specific of multimodal registration. Lastly, we also demonstrate the underlying robustness of the proposed framework to varying levels of explicit regularization while maintaining low error, its suitability for registration at varying scales, and its efficiency with respect to other methods targeted to large-deformation registration.

*Paul Dobre,Jackson Cooper,Xin Wang,Hongzhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCPainter is a unified framework that combines 3D Gaussian Splat asset representations with diffusion models to enable realistic 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis for autonomous driving simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods treat 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis separately, limiting the creation of diverse, realistic training data for autonomous driving. A unified approach is needed to combine realistic asset integration with viewpoint synthesis for more robust simulation.

Method: SCPainter integrates 3D Gaussian Splat car assets and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation. Assets and scene point clouds are projected into novel views, and these projections condition a diffusion model to generate high-quality images.

Result: Evaluation on Waymo Open Dataset demonstrates the framework's capability to enable both 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis, facilitating creation of diverse and realistic driving data.

Conclusion: SCPainter provides a unified solution for realistic 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis, enabling more diverse and comprehensive training data generation for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: 3D Asset insertion and novel view synthesis (NVS) are key components for autonomous driving simulation, enhancing the diversity of training data. With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images. Evaluation on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the capability of our framework to enable 3D asset insertion and NVS, facilitating the creation of diverse and realistic driving data.

TL;DR: Self-supervised pretraining (USF-MAE) on unlabeled ultrasound images improves automated detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester scans compared to supervised DenseNet-169 baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal finding associated with chromosomal abnormalities and adverse outcomes. Automated detection could improve reproducibility and scalability of early screening, but supervised deep learning is limited by small labeled datasets.

Method: Fine-tuned Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabeled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal vs cystic hygroma cases. Used same dataset, preprocessing, and 4-fold cross-validation as DenseNet-169 baseline. Evaluated with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC-AUC, and Score-CAM visualizations for interpretability.

Result: USF-MAE outperformed DenseNet-169 on all metrics: mean accuracy 0.96 vs 0.93, sensitivity 0.94 vs 0.92, specificity 0.98 vs 0.94, ROC-AUC 0.98 vs 0.94. Score-CAM visualizations showed clinically relevant attention to fetal neck regions. Performance improvements were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).

Conclusion: Ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining enables accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma, overcoming limitations of small labeled datasets and outperforming supervised baselines.

Abstract: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).

TL;DR: Freetime FeatureGS enables decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos using Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion, eliminating the need for video segmentation through contrastive learning and streaming feature propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on video segmentation results which are often unstable, leading to unreliable 4D reconstruction. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by eliminating the need for video segmentation altogether.

Method: Represents dynamic scenes as Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability (Freetime FeatureGS). Uses contrastive loss to align primitive features with 2D segmentation maps, and implements streaming feature learning with temporally ordered sampling for temporal propagation.

Result: Experimental results on several datasets show that the reconstruction quality outperforms recent methods by a large margin, demonstrating superior 4D scene decomposition without video segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed Freetime FeatureGS with streaming feature learning successfully achieves decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos without relying on unstable video segmentation, offering more reliable and accurate results.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos. Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process. Experimental results on several datasets show that the reconstruction quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.

*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Bo Huang,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel adaptive visual token pruning method for Large Multimodal Models that handles long context with multiple images by dynamically allocating token budgets based on intra-image diversity and inter-image variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual token pruning reduces inference costs in LMMs, but existing methods fail to handle long context inputs with multiple images effectively. The growing number of visual tokens significantly increases computational overhead, especially in multi-image scenarios.

Method: Two-stage adaptive pruning: 1) Intra-image stage allocates content-aware token budgets per image and greedily selects representative tokens; 2) Inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool, then applies Pareto selection balancing diversity with text alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly reducing the number of visual tokens, demonstrating effectiveness in multi-image scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive visual token pruning method effectively addresses the challenges of long context, multi-image settings in LMMs by decomposing redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and dynamically allocating token budgets.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have proven effective on various tasks. They typically encode visual inputs into Original Model sequences of tokens, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by the language model. However, the growing number of visual tokens greatly increases inference cost. Visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment. Extensive experiments show that our approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly cutting down the number of visual tokens.

Conclusion: Highlights importance of spatial continuity and neighbor structure in ViT optimization, offering new architectural insights for efficient visual recognition.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in visual recognition tasks, but redundant token representations limit their computational efficiency. Existing token merging and pruning strategies often overlook spatial continuity and neighbor relationships, resulting in the loss of local context. This paper proposes novel neighbor-aware token reduction methods based on Hilbert curve reordering, which explicitly preserves the neighbor structure in a 2D space using 1D sequential representations. Our method introduces two key strategies: Neighbor-Aware Pruning (NAP) for selective token retention and Merging by Adjacent Token similarity (MAT) for local token aggregation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing methods. This work highlights the importance of spatial continuity and neighbor structure, offering new insights for the architectural optimization of ViTs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantics and dynamics understanding is crucial for embodied agents, but existing data has redundancy. Need principled view selection to prioritize informative frames for training rather than using heuristic or random strategies.

Method: Formulate view selection as active learning problem. Use Fisher Information to quantify informativeness of candidate views with respect to semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks. Jointly handles semantic reasoning and dynamic scene modeling.

Result: Method evaluated on large-scale static images and dynamic video datasets with multi-camera setups. Consistently improves rendering quality and semantic segmentation performance, outperforming random selection and uncertainty-based heuristic baselines.

Conclusion: Proposed active learning with Fisher Information provides principled view selection for joint semantic and dynamic scene understanding, demonstrating effectiveness over heuristic approaches.

Abstract: Understanding semantics and dynamics has been crucial for embodied agents in various tasks. Both tasks have much more data redundancy than the static scene understanding task. We formulate the view selection problem as an active learning problem, where the goal is to prioritize frames that provide the greatest information gain for model training. To this end, we propose an active learning algorithm with Fisher Information that quantifies the informativeness of candidate views with respect to both semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks. This formulation allows our method to jointly handle semantic reasoning and dynamic scene modeling, providing a principled alternative to heuristic or random strategies. We evaluate our method on large-scale static images and dynamic video datasets by selecting informative frames from multi-camera setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves rendering quality and semantic segmentation performance, outperforming baseline methods based on random selection and uncertainty-based heuristics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes AGQG module using Arithmetic Graded Response Model to address semantic drift in AGIQA by modeling image quality as ability meeting difficulty levels, improving existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AGIQA models suffer from "semantic drift" where image embeddings show inconsistent similarities across quality grades, undermining reliability of text-image shared-space learning.

Method: Proposes Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module with two branches: one estimates image ability, the other constructs multiple difficulty levels using arithmetic modeling to ensure monotonicity and unimodal quality distribution.

Result: AGQG module shows plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks, and generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed AGQG module addresses semantic drift in AGIQA through psychometric-inspired graded response modeling, offering a promising component for future IQA models with improved reliability and interpretability.

Abstract: Existing AGIQA models typically estimate image quality by measuring and aggregating the similarities between image embeddings and text embeddings derived from multi-grade quality descriptions. Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both "excellent" and "poor" grade descriptions while deviating from the "good" one. We refer to this phenomenon as "semantic drift", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks. Moreover, it also generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment, revealing its potential as a key component in future IQA models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPD-Solver is a novel ODE solver that accelerates diffusion model sampling by using parallel gradient evaluations to reduce truncation errors while maintaining low latency through full parallelization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high sampling latency due to sequential denoising, and existing acceleration methods suffer from image quality degradation under low-latency budgets, primarily from accumulated truncation errors in high-curvature trajectory segments.

Method: EPD-Solver incorporates multiple parallel gradient evaluations per step using Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions, with a two-stage optimization: 1) distillation-based parameter learning, and 2) parameter-efficient RL fine-tuning that treats the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy operating only in low-dimensional solver space.

Result: The method mitigates truncation errors while preserving low-latency sampling through full parallelization of gradient computations, and can serve as a plugin (EPD-Plugin) to improve existing ODE samplers.

Conclusion: EPD-Solver effectively addresses the latency-quality trade-off in diffusion model sampling by leveraging geometric insights about sampling trajectories and parallel computation, with RL fine-tuning that avoids reward hacking by operating in the low-dimensional solver space.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature. Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. In addition, our method is flexible and can serve as a plugin (EPD-Plugin) to improve existing ODE samplers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language tracking methods are limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. There's a need for more robust tracking that can search globally across the entire image space.

Method: Proposes VPTracker, a global tracking framework using Multimodal Large Language Models with location-aware visual prompting. The method constructs region-level prompts based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, opening a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking.

Conclusion: VPTracker introduces the first global tracking framework using MLLMs, effectively addressing limitations of local search methods while suppressing interference from distracting visual content through location-aware visual prompting.

Abstract: Vision-Language Tracking aims to continuously localize objects described by a visual template and a language description. Existing methods, however, are typically limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. In this work, we introduce the first global tracking framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (VPTracker), exploiting their powerful semantic reasoning to locate targets across the entire image space. While global search improves robustness and reduces drift, it also introduces distractions from visually or semantically similar objects. To address this, we propose a location-aware visual prompting mechanism that incorporates spatial priors into the MLLM. Specifically, we construct a region-level prompt based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary. This design retains the advantages of global tracking while effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, opening a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking.

Motivation: To assess how open-vocabulary object detection models perform under real-world low-quality image conditions, which is important for practical applications where image quality varies.

Method: Created a new dataset simulating real-world low-quality images, then evaluated multiple open-vocabulary detection models (OWLv2, OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, Detic) on this dataset under different degradation levels.

Result: Models showed no significant mAP decrease under low-level degradation, but all models dropped sharply under high-level degradation. OWLv2 performed consistently better across degradation types, while OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic showed significant performance declines.

Conclusion: Open-vocabulary detection models are vulnerable to high-level image degradation, highlighting the need for robustness improvements. OWLv2 demonstrates better resilience, and the released dataset will support future research in this area.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection enables models to localize and recognize objects beyond a predefined set of categories and is expected to achieve recognition capabilities comparable to human performance. In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance of existing models on open-vocabulary object detection tasks under low-quality image conditions. For this purpose, we introduce a new dataset that simulates low-quality images in the real world. In our evaluation experiment, we find that although open-vocabulary object detection models exhibited no significant decrease in mAP scores under low-level image degradation, the performance of all models dropped sharply under high-level image degradation. OWLv2 models consistently performed better across different types of degradation, while OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic showed significant performance declines.

Motivation: Existing datasets for modeling human reactions from egocentric video suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between video and reaction motion (e.g., dynamic motions paired with fixed-camera videos), making it challenging to achieve both causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment.

Method: 1) Construct Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) with spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction pairs; 2) Use Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder to compress reaction motion into compact latent space; 3) Train Generative Pre-trained Transformer for autoregressive reaction generation from visual input; 4) Incorporate 3D dynamic features (metric depth and head dynamics) to enhance spatial grounding.

Result: EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods while maintaining strict causality during generation. The framework operates in real-time.

Conclusion: EgoReAct successfully addresses the dual challenges of causal generation and 3D spatial alignment for human reaction modeling from egocentric video, with the HRD dataset and the autoregressive framework enabling real-time, spatially consistent reaction generation.

Abstract: Humans exhibit adaptive, context-sensitive responses to egocentric visual input. However, faithfully modeling such reactions from egocentric video remains challenging due to the dual requirements of strictly causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation. We will release code, models, and data upon acceptance.

*Hualie Jiang,Ziyang Song,Zhiqiang Lou,Rui Xu,Minglang Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA360 adapts Depth Anything V2 for panoramic depth estimation by learning shift parameters and using circular padding, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with 30-50% error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic depth estimation has poor zero-shot generalization to open-world domains compared to perspective images, creating a need to transfer capabilities from the perspective domain to panoramic settings.

Method: DA360 adapts Depth Anything V2 for panoramic use by: 1) learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone to transform scale-and-shift-invariant output into scale-invariant estimates for proper 3D point clouds, and 2) integrating circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts and ensure spherical continuity.

Result: DA360 achieves over 50% relative depth error reduction on indoor benchmarks and 10% on outdoor benchmarks compared to its base model. It outperforms existing panoramic depth methods by about 30% relative error improvement compared to PanDA across all three test datasets, establishing new state-of-the-art for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed DA360 successfully bridges the gap between perspective and panoramic depth estimation by adapting a perspective-based model with shift parameter learning and circular padding, achieving superior zero-shot generalization and establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Panoramic depth estimation provides a comprehensive solution for capturing complete $360^\circ$ environmental structural information, offering significant benefits for robotics and AR/VR applications. However, while extensively studied in indoor settings, its zero-shot generalization to open-world domains lags far behind perspective images, which benefit from abundant training data. This disparity makes transferring capabilities from the perspective domain an attractive solution. To bridge this gap, we present Depth Anything in $360^\circ$ (DA360), a panoramic-adapted version of Depth Anything V2. Our key innovation involves learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone, transforming the model's scale- and shift-invariant output into a scale-invariant estimate that directly yields well-formed 3D point clouds. This is complemented by integrating circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts, ensuring spatially coherent depth maps that respect spherical continuity. Evaluated on standard indoor benchmarks and our newly curated outdoor dataset, Metropolis, DA360 shows substantial gains over its base model, achieving over 50\% and 10\% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, DA360 significantly outperforms robust panoramic depth estimation methods, achieving about 30\% relative error improvement compared to PanDA across all three test datasets and establishing new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation.

TL;DR: Proposes KANO, a novel interpretable operator for image super-resolution based on Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, using B-spline functions to model degradation processes transparently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretable SR methods rely on black-box deep networks, leaving degradation processes unknown and uncontrollable. Need for transparent, structured representations of latent degradation fitting.

Method: Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO) uses additive structure of finite B-spline functions to approximate spectral curves piecewise. Learns shape parameters of splines to capture local linear trends and peak-valley structures at nonlinear inflection points.

Result: KANO accurately captures key spectral characteristics and endows SR results with physical interpretability. Comparative study shows advantages of KANs over MLPs in handling complex sequence fitting tasks and characterizing degradation mechanisms.

Conclusion: KANO provides transparent, structured representation for interpretable SR, offering valuable insights for developing interpretable SR techniques through systematic comparison of MLPs and KANs.

Abstract: The highly nonlinear degradation process, complex physical interactions, and various sources of uncertainty render single-image Super-resolution (SR) a particularly challenging task. Existing interpretable SR approaches, whether based on prior learning or deep unfolding optimization frameworks, typically rely on black-box deep networks to model latent variables, which leaves the degradation process largely unknown and uncontrollable. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem (KAT), we for the first time propose a novel interpretable operator, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), with the application to image SR. KANO provides a transparent and structured representation of the latent degradation fitting process. Specifically, we employ an additive structure composed of a finite number of B-spline functions to approximate continuous spectral curves in a piecewise fashion. By learning and optimizing the shape parameters of these spline functions within defined intervals, our KANO accurately captures key spectral characteristics, such as local linear trends and the peak-valley structures at nonlinear inflection points, thereby endowing SR results with physical interpretability. Furthermore, through theoretical modeling and experimental evaluations across natural images, aerial photographs, and satellite remote sensing data, we systematically compare multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in handling complex sequence fitting tasks. This comparative study elucidates the respective advantages and limitations of these models in characterizing intricate degradation mechanisms, offering valuable insights for the development of interpretable SR techniques.

Conclusion: SCaR-3D effectively addresses spatial inconsistency and state separation limitations in 3D change detection, enabling robust object-level change detection and continual scene reconstruction for monitoring and exploration applications.

Abstract: Change detection plays a vital role in scene monitoring, exploration, and continual reconstruction. Existing 3D change detection methods often exhibit spatial inconsistency in the detected changes and fail to explicitly separate pre- and post-change states. To address these limitations, we propose SCaR-3D, a novel 3D scene change detection framework that identifies object-level changes from a dense-view pre-change image sequence and sparse-view post-change images. Our approach consists of a signed-distance-based 2D differencing module followed by multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, leveraging the consistent nature of 3DGS to robustly separate pre- and post-change states. We further develop a continual scene reconstruction strategy that selectively updates dynamic regions while preserving the unchanged areas. We also contribute CCS3D, a challenging synthetic dataset that allows flexible combinations of 3D change types to support controlled evaluations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves both high accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.

*Zhenbao Yu,Shirong Ye,Ronghe Jin,Shunkun Liang,Zibin Liu,Huiyun Zhang,Banglei Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel solver that estimates 3DOF relative pose and focal length from two affine correspondences when vertical direction is known from IMU measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In applications like self-driving cars, smartphones, and UAVs where cameras are combined with IMUs, the vertical direction can be obtained from IMU measurements, reducing relative pose estimation from 5DOF to 3DOF, enabling more efficient estimation with fewer correspondences.

Method: Establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences with known vertical direction, derive four equations involving only focal length and relative rotation angle using properties of equation systems with nontrivial solutions, then solve using polynomial eigenvalue method.

Result: The proposed solver outperforms existing state-of-the-art solvers in evaluations using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The method successfully estimates relative pose and focal length from just two affine correspondences when vertical direction is known, providing an efficient solution for camera-IMU systems with superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to estimate the relative pose and focal length between two views with known intrinsic parameters except for an unknown focal length from two affine correspondences (ACs). Cameras are commonly used in combination with inertial measurement units (IMUs) in applications such as self-driving cars, smartphones, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle. Finally, the polynomial eigenvalue method is utilized to solve the problem of focal length and relative rotation angle. The proposed solver is evaluated using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our solver performs better than the existing state-of-the-art solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI video generation methods have two critical limitations: (1) lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view object information, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions.

Conclusion: ByteLoom addresses key limitations in HOI video generation by providing geometrically consistent object illustration with simplified conditioning, overcoming dataset scarcity and reducing dependency on hand mesh annotations.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) video generation has garnered increasing attention due to its promising applications in digital humans, e-commerce, advertising, and robotics imitation learning. However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.

Conclusion: MUSON addresses key limitations in social navigation datasets by providing structured reasoning supervision and balanced action distributions, enabling better learning of safety-critical behaviors and serving as a valuable benchmark for the field.

Abstract: Socially compliant navigation requires structured reasoning over dynamic pedestrians and physical constraints to ensure safe and interpretable decisions. However, existing social navigation datasets often lack explicit reasoning supervision and exhibit highly long-tailed action distributions, limiting models' ability to learn safety-critical behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce MUSON, a multimodal dataset for short-horizon social navigation collected across diverse indoor and outdoor campus scenes. MUSON adopts a structured five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation consisting of perception, prediction, reasoning, action, and explanation, with explicit modeling of static physical constraints and a rationally balanced discrete action space. Compared to SNEI, MUSON provides consistent reasoning, action, and explanation. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art Small Vision Language Models on MUSON shows that Qwen2.5-VL-3B achieves the highest decision accuracy of 0.8625, demonstrating that MUSON serves as an effective and reusable benchmark for socially compliant navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised learning methods in medical imaging overlook the anatomical foundation of medical images, which directly represent internal body structures with consistency, coherence, and hierarchy. This limits their ability to effectively learn anatomical features.

Method: Lamps (Learning Anatomy from Multiple Perspectives via Self-Supervision) pre-trains on large-scale chest radiographs by harmoniously utilizing the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy as supervision signals.

Result: Extensive experiments across 10 datasets show Lamps' superior robustness, transferability, and clinical potential compared to 10 baseline models, demonstrating better performance in fine-tuning and emergent property analysis.

Conclusion: By learning from multiple anatomical perspectives, Lamps enables foundation models to develop meaningful, robust representations aligned with human anatomy structure, offering unique opportunities for medical imaging foundation models.

Abstract: Foundation models have been successful in natural language processing and computer vision because they are capable of capturing the underlying structures (foundation) of natural languages. However, in medical imaging, the key foundation lies in human anatomy, as these images directly represent the internal structures of the body, reflecting the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy. Yet, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often overlook these perspectives, limiting their ability to effectively learn anatomical features. To overcome the limitation, we built Lamps (learning anatomy from multiple perspectives via self-supervision) pre-trained on large-scale chest radiographs by harmoniously utilizing the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments across 10 datasets evaluated through fine-tuning and emergent property analysis demonstrate Lamps' superior robustness, transferability, and clinical potential when compared to 10 baseline models. By learning from multiple perspectives, Lamps presents a unique opportunity for foundation models to develop meaningful, robust representations that are aligned with the structure of human anatomy.

TL;DR: A data-oriented approach to mitigate spurious correlations in deep learning by identifying, neutralizing, eliminating, and updating features, achieving over 20% improvement in worst group accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often learn spurious features that correlate with class labels but are irrelevant to the prediction task. Existing methods rely on manual annotation or empirical assumptions about bias simplicity, which may fail due to the complex nature of real-world spurious correlations.

Method: 1) Identify spurious features by observing that samples influenced by spurious features exhibit dispersed distribution in feature space; 2) Obtain bias-invariant representation by neutralizing spurious features using simple grouping; 3) Learn feature transformation to eliminate spurious features by aligning with bias-invariant representation; 4) Update classifier with learned transformation to obtain unbiased model.

Result: Experiments on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks show improvement in worst group accuracy of more than 20% compared to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM).

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively mitigates spurious correlations in deep learning models through a systematic approach of identifying, neutralizing, eliminating, and updating features, demonstrating significant performance gains on debiasing tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning models are known to often learn features that spuriously correlate with the class label during training but are irrelevant to the prediction task. Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying, neutralizing, eliminating and updating procedures, we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation. Experiments on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks show an improvement in worst group accuracy of more than 20% compared to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept erasure methods focus only on text prompts, ignoring other input modalities (learned embeddings, inverted latents) that can be exploited as attack surfaces, allowing erased concepts to re-emerge despite defenses.

Method: 1) M-ErasureBench: multimodal evaluation framework testing concept erasure across text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents (with white-box/black-box access). 2) IRECE: plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs associated latents during denoising.

Result: Existing methods achieve strong erasure against text prompts but fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents (CRR >90% in white-box). IRECE reduces CRR by up to 40% in challenging white-box latent inversion scenarios while preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark for concept erasure beyond text prompts. Combined with IRECE, it offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models against multimodal attacks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models may generate harmful or copyrighted content, motivating research on concept erasure. However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts. Together with IRECE, our benchmark offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models.

Abstract: The recent integration of artificial intelligence into medical imaging has driven remarkable advances in automated organ segmentation. However, most existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely exclusively on visual learning from large annotated datasets restricting their adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPS (Guided Path Sampling) fixes CFG's instability in iterative refinement by replacing extrapolation with manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring bounded error and better image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) causes iterative refinement methods to fail because its extrapolative nature pushes sampling paths off the data manifold, making approximation errors diverge and undermining refinement quality.

Method: Proposes Guided Path Sampling (GPS) that replaces CFG's unstable extrapolation with principled, manifold-constrained interpolation to keep sampling paths on the data manifold. Also develops optimal scheduling to dynamically adjust guidance strength, aligning semantic injection with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process.

Result: GPS outperforms existing methods on SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT backbones, achieving ImageReward of 0.79 and HPS v2 of 0.2995 on SDXL, and improving semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval to 57.45%. Theoretically proves GPS transforms error series from unbounded to strictly bounded.

Conclusion: Path stability is essential for effective iterative refinement, and GPS provides a robust framework to achieve it by ensuring manifold-constrained sampling and optimal guidance scheduling.

Abstract: Iterative refinement methods based on a denoising-inversion cycle are powerful tools for enhancing the quality and control of diffusion models. However, their effectiveness is critically limited when combined with standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). We identify a fundamental limitation: CFG's extrapolative nature systematically pushes the sampling path off the data manifold, causing the approximation error to diverge and undermining the refinement process. To address this, we propose Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for iterative refinement. GPS replaces unstable extrapolation with a principled, manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring the sampling path remains on the data manifold. We theoretically prove that this correction transforms the error series from unbounded amplification to strictly bounded, guaranteeing stability. Furthermore, we devise an optimal scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance strength, aligning semantic injection with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process. Extensive experiments on modern backbones like SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT show that GPS outperforms existing methods in both perceptual quality and complex prompt adherence. For instance, GPS achieves a superior ImageReward of 0.79 and HPS v2 of 0.2995 on SDXL, while improving overall semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval to 57.45%. Our work establishes that path stability is a prerequisite for effective iterative refinement, and GPS provides a robust framework to achieve it.

TL;DR: A hash grid feature pruning method for Gaussian splatting that identifies and removes invalid features to reduce storage/transmission overhead without performance loss, achieving 8% bitrate reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hash grids in Gaussian splatting have many invalid features due to irregular/non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, causing redundant storage and transmission overhead.

Method: Proposes a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on input Gaussian splat coordinates, encoding only valid features to reduce storage size.

Result: Achieves average 8% bitrate reduction compared to baseline while maintaining model performance, following Common Test Conditions (CTC) defined by standardization committee.

Conclusion: The pruning approach effectively reduces hash grid storage size without compromising performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance for Gaussian splatting.

Abstract: Hash grids are widely used to learn an implicit neural field for Gaussian splatting, serving either as part of the entropy model or for inter-frame prediction. However, due to the irregular and non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, numerous sparse regions exist, rendering many features in the hash grid invalid. This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance. Following the Common Test Conditions (CTC) defined by the standardization committee, our method achieves an average bitrate reduction of 8% compared to the baseline approach.

This design enables temporally coherent video-audio understanding and generation from multimodal instructions. We design an effective three-stage training pipeline consisting of multimodal pretraining, audio-video fine-tuning, and large-scale instruction-tuning, to progressively build multimodal comprehension and generation from existing vision-language models. To support this, we further construct JavisInst-Omni, a high-quality instruction dataset with over 200K GPT-4o-curated audio-video-text dialogues that span diverse and multi-level comprehension and generation scenarios. Extensive experiments on JAV comprehension and generation benchmarks show that JavisGPT outperforms existing MLLMs, particularly in complex and temporally synchronized settings.

*Qihang Peng,Xuesong Chen,Chenye Yang,Shaoshuai Shi,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColaVLA is a vision-language-action framework for autonomous driving that transfers VLM reasoning to latent space and uses hierarchical parallel planning for efficient, safe trajectory generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based planners face challenges: mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, high latency from autoregressive decoding, and inefficient/non-causal planners limiting real-time deployment.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into decision-oriented meta-action embeddings via ego-adaptive selection with only two VLM forward passes; 2) Hierarchical Parallel Planner generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmark in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: ColaVLA preserves VLM generalization and interpretability while enabling efficient, accurate, and safe trajectory generation for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires generating safe and reliable trajectories from complex multimodal inputs. Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.

*Zhicheng Zhao,Xuanang Fan,Lingma Sun,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRMNet is a novel detection framework that uses density maps as spatial priors to focus computational resources on dense object regions in high-resolution remote sensing imagery, improving detection of tiny, occluded objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods fail to adaptively focus on density-concentrated regions in remote sensing imagery, where tiny objects suffer from severe mutual occlusion and limited pixel footprints, leading to ineffective feature learning.

Method: Three key components: 1) Density Generation Branch to model object distribution patterns, 2) Dense Area Focusing Module that uses density maps to efficiently focus on dense regions, and 3) Dual Filter Fusion Module that disentangles multi-scale features into frequency components and performs density-guided cross-attention.

Result: Extensive experiments on AI-TOD and DTOD datasets show DRMNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex scenarios with high object density and severe occlusion.

Conclusion: DRMNet effectively addresses the challenges of detecting tiny, densely clustered objects in remote sensing imagery by using density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning and computational resource allocation.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery increasingly contains dense clusters of tiny objects, the detection of which is extremely challenging due to severe mutual occlusion and limited pixel footprints. Existing detection methods typically allocate computational resources uniformly, failing to adaptively focus on these density-concentrated regions, which hinders feature learning effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet), which leverages density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning. First, we design a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns, providing quantifiable priors that guide the network toward dense regions. Second, to address the computational bottleneck of global attention, our Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) uses these density maps to identify and focus on dense areas, enabling efficient local-global feature interaction. Finally, to mitigate feature degradation during hierarchical extraction, we introduce a Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM). It disentangles multi-scale features into high- and low-frequency components using a discrete cosine transform and then performs density-guided cross-attention to enhance complementarity while suppressing background interference. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD and DTOD datasets demonstrate that DRMNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex scenarios with high object density and severe occlusion.

TL;DR: CLIP-Joint-Detect integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision into object detectors via joint training, improving performance while maintaining real-time speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional object detectors using cross-entropy classification are vulnerable to class imbalance and label noise, motivating the need for more robust supervision methods.

Method: A detector-agnostic framework with a lightweight parallel head projects region/grid features into CLIP embedding space, aligning them with learnable class-specific text embeddings using InfoNCE contrastive loss plus auxiliary cross-entropy, while optimizing all standard detection losses simultaneously.

Result: Achieves consistent and substantial improvements on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 (with Faster R-CNN) and MS COCO 2017 (with YOLOv11) while preserving real-time inference speed.

Conclusion: Joint optimization with learnable text embeddings significantly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets, offering a simple yet effective approach to improve object detection robustness.

Abstract: Conventional object detectors rely on cross-entropy classification, which can be vulnerable to class imbalance and label noise. We propose CLIP-Joint-Detect, a simple and detector-agnostic framework that integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision through end-to-end joint training. A lightweight parallel head projects region or grid features into the CLIP embedding space and aligns them with learnable class-specific text embeddings via InfoNCE contrastive loss and an auxiliary cross-entropy term, while all standard detection losses are optimized simultaneously. The approach applies seamlessly to both two-stage and one-stage architectures. We validate it on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 using Faster R-CNN and on the large-scale MS COCO 2017 benchmark using modern YOLO detectors (YOLOv11), achieving consistent and substantial improvements while preserving real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that joint optimization with learnable text embeddings markedly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: WRCFormer: A novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw 4D radar cubes with camera data using multi-view representations and wavelet-based attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance on K-Radar benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D mmWave radar is cost-effective and robust in all weather but suffers from sparsity and limited semantic information. Camera-radar fusion addresses this, but point-cloud radar loses information and raw radar data is computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes WRCFormer with: 1) Multi-view representations of decoupled radar cube, 2) Wavelet Attention Module in wavelet-based FPN for sparse signal enhancement, 3) Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion - a two-stage query-based modality-agnostic fusion mechanism.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on K-Radar benchmarks: ~2.4% improvement in all scenarios and ~1.6% improvement in sleet scenario, demonstrating robustness under adverse weather conditions.

Conclusion: WRCFormer effectively addresses computational challenges of raw radar data while leveraging complementary camera-radar fusion, showing superior performance especially in challenging weather conditions.

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has been widely adopted in autonomous driving and robot perception due to its low cost and all-weather robustness. However, its inherent sparsity and limited semantic richness significantly constrain perception capability. Recently, fusing camera data with 4D radar has emerged as a promising cost effective solution, by exploiting the complementary strengths of the two modalities. Nevertheless, point-cloud-based radar often suffer from information loss introduced by multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar data incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw radar cubes with camera inputs via multi-view representations of the decoupled radar cube. Specifically, we design a Wavelet Attention Module as the basic module of wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enhance the representation of sparse radar signals and image data. We further introduce a two-stage query-based, modality-agnostic fusion mechanism termed Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion to efficiently integrate multi-view features from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WRCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar benchmarks, surpassing the best model by approximately 2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in the sleet scenario, highlighting its robustness under adverse weather conditions.

*Shizhou Zhang,Xueqiang Lv,Yinghui Xing,Qirui Wu,Di Xu,Chen Zhao,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO-IOD introduces a real-time incremental object detection framework for YOLO-based detectors that addresses three knowledge conflicts causing catastrophic forgetting, achieving superior performance with minimal forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current incremental object detection methods rely on Faster R-CNN or DETR detectors but don't support real-time YOLO frameworks. The paper identifies three knowledge conflicts causing catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors and aims to create a practical real-time solution.

Method: YOLO-IOD is built on pretrained YOLO-World with stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning. It includes: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR) to address foreground-background confusion, 2) Importance-based Kernel Selection (IKS) to identify and update crucial convolution kernels, and 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) to handle misaligned knowledge distillation between old and new categories.

Result: Experiments on conventional and new LoCo COCO benchmarks show YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting. The paper also introduces LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages.

Conclusion: YOLO-IOD successfully addresses the three identified knowledge conflicts in YOLO-based incremental object detection, providing a real-time framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance while minimizing catastrophic forgetting, making incremental learning practical for YOLO detectors.

Abstract: Current methods for incremental object detection (IOD) primarily rely on Faster R-CNN or DETR series detectors; however, these approaches do not accommodate the real-time YOLO detection frameworks. In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.

TL;DR: ReamCamo is a unified out-painting framework for realistic camouflaged image generation with layout controls and multi-modal conditions to improve semantic coherence and visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camouflaged image generation methods have limitations: they either produce insufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or create cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets, creating a substantial gap from real camouflaged imagery.

Method: Proposes ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework with: 1) explicit layout controls to regulate global image structure and improve semantic coherence, 2) multi-modal textual-visual conditions combining fine-grained textual task descriptions with texture-oriented background retrieval, and 3) a background-foreground distribution divergence metric to quantitatively assess camouflage quality.

Result: Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in generating realistic camouflaged images with improved semantic coherence and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: ReamCamo addresses key limitations in existing camouflaged image generation methods by introducing layout controls and multi-modal conditions, providing a more effective approach for generating high-quality training data for camouflaged object detection.

Abstract: Camouflaged image generation (CIG) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative for acquiring high-quality training data for camouflaged object detection (COD). However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: PoseStreamer: A robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework using event cameras for high-speed moving objects, featuring temporal consistency, 2D tracking priors, and geometric refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RGB cameras suffer from motion blur in high-speed and low-light scenarios, making 6DoF pose estimation challenging. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution but current methods yield suboptimal performance for high-speed moving objects.

Method: Three core components: 1) Adaptive Pose Memory Queue for temporal consistency using historical orientation cues, 2) Object-centric 2D Tracker providing strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and 3) Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Also introduces MoCapCube6D dataset for benchmarking rapid motion performance.

Result: PoseStreamer achieves superior accuracy in high-speed moving scenarios and exhibits strong generalizability as a template-free framework for unseen moving objects.

Conclusion: The proposed PoseStreamer framework effectively addresses the challenges of 6DoF pose estimation in high-speed scenarios using event cameras, demonstrating both accuracy and generalizability for novel moving objects.

Abstract: Six degree of freedom (6DoF) pose estimation for novel objects is a critical task in computer vision, yet it faces significant challenges in high-speed and low-light scenarios where standard RGB cameras suffer from motion blur. While event cameras offer a promising solution due to their high temporal resolution, current 6DoF pose estimation methods typically yield suboptimal performance in high-speed object moving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose PoseStreamer, a robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework designed specifically on high-speed moving scenarios. Our approach integrates three core components: an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue that utilizes historical orientation cues for temporal consistency, an Object-centric 2D Tracker that provides strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and a Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Furthermore, we introduce MoCapCube6D, a novel multi-modal dataset constructed to benchmark performance under rapid motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseStreamer not only achieves superior accuracy in high-speed moving scenarios, but also exhibits strong generalizability as a template-free framework for unseen moving objects.

*Linglin Liao,Qichuan Geng,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSA framework improves medical image segmentation by better handling hybrid medical texts (locational, descriptive, diagnostic) through symmetric optimal transport alignment and spatial constraint guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-guided medical image segmentation methods struggle with processing diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to inaccurate segmentation results (e.g., mislocating lesions despite spatial text cues).

Method: Proposes Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework with: 1) symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism for bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences between image regions and multiple text expressions, and 2) composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints via region-level guidance masks.

Result: Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling at accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.

Conclusion: SSA effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by enhancing the capacity to process hybrid medical texts with spatial awareness, leading to more accurate and clinically relevant segmentation results.

Abstract: Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation has shown considerable promise for medical image segmentation, with rich clinical text serving as an effective supplement for scarce data. However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text "in the left lower lung", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reverse personalization framework for face anonymization that uses conditional diffusion inversion to remove identity without text prompts, with identity-guided conditioning for generalization and attribute control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based methods for identity removal/modification require subjects to be well-represented in pre-trained models or need model fine-tuning, lacking control over facial attributes during anonymization.

Method: Uses conditional diffusion inversion for direct image manipulation without text prompts, incorporates identity-guided conditioning branch to generalize beyond training subjects, and supports attribute-controllable anonymization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality, outperforming prior anonymization methods.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel reverse personalization framework that enables effective face anonymization with attribute control, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation of realistic facial images conditioned on textual prompts and human identities, enabling creating personalized facial imagery. However, existing prompt-based methods for removing or modifying identity-specific features rely either on the subject being well-represented in the pre-trained model or require model fine-tuning for specific identities. In this work, we analyze the identity generation process and introduce a reverse personalization framework for face anonymization. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion inversion, allowing direct manipulation of images without using text prompts. To generalize beyond subjects in the model's training data, we incorporate an identity-guided conditioning branch. Unlike prior anonymization methods, which lack control over facial attributes, our framework supports attribute-controllable anonymization. We demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D visual grounding methods rely on pre-defined Object Lookup Tables (OLTs) to query VLMs, which limits applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. This restricts the ability to handle open-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes OpenGround with Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module that progressively augments VLM cognitive scope through human-like perception via cognitive task chains. It actively reasons about contextually relevant objects and uses dynamically updated OLTs instead of pre-defined ones.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers 17.6% improvement on the new OpenTarget dataset containing 7000+ object-description pairs for open-world evaluation.

Conclusion: OpenGround enables zero-shot open-world 3D visual grounding by overcoming fundamental limitations of pre-defined OLTs through active cognition-based reasoning, making it applicable to both pre-defined and open-world categories.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to locate objects based on natural language descriptions in 3D scenes. Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

### [174] [With Great Context Comes Great Prediction Power: Classifying Objects via Geo-Semantic Scene Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23024)
*Ciprian Constantinescu,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for contextual object classification using Geo-Semantic Contextual Graphs (GSCG) that integrates depth estimation with panoptic/material segmentation to create structured scene representations, achieving 73.4% accuracy and dramatically outperforming context-agnostic and LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans use rich scene context (spatial relationships, material properties, object co-occurrence) for object recognition, but most computational systems operate on isolated image regions, ignoring this vital contextual information.

Method: Construct Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from single monocular images by integrating metric depth estimation with unified panoptic and material segmentation. Objects become nodes with geometric/chromatic/material attributes, spatial relationships become edges. Then use specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from target object, immediate neighbors, and global scene context.

Result: Achieves 73.4% classification accuracy, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (as low as 38.4%). Surpasses fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%) and state-of-the-art multimodal LLM (Llama 4 Scout) which maxes at 42.3% even with full image and detailed object descriptions.

Conclusion: Explicitly structured and interpretable context (via GSCG) is superior for object recognition tasks, highlighting the critical role of context and demonstrating that structured graph representations enable more effective and interpretable reasoning than isolated or LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Humans effortlessly identify objects by leveraging a rich understanding of the surrounding scene, including spatial relationships, material properties, and the co-occurrence of other objects. In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our context-aware model achieves a classification accuracy of 73.4%, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (as low as 38.4%). Furthermore, our GSCG-based approach significantly surpasses strong baselines, including fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%) and a state-of-the-art multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), Llama 4 Scout, which, even when given the full image alongside a detailed description of objects, maxes out at 42.3%. These results on COCO 2017 train/val splits highlight the superiority of explicitly structured and interpretable context for object recognition tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural properties of modern vision-language models translate to practical implementation in a video analysis pipeline, specifically for person detection with emotion attributes, and to identify critical distinctions for robust system design and evaluation.

Method: Architecture-led analysis of two VLMs, examining their multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, instruction following), then connecting model behavior to a practical pipeline that samples video frames, prompts VLMs for person detection with bounding boxes and emotion attributes, validates output structure, and optionally renders annotated videos.

Result: Identified key system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid but semantically incorrect, schema validation only checks structure not geometric correctness, person identifiers are frame-local, and interactive analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON.

Conclusion: These architectural distinctions are critical for writing defensible claims, designing robust interfaces, and planning evaluation in vision-language systems, highlighting the gap between model capabilities and practical implementation requirements.

Abstract: This report provides an architecture-led analysis of two modern vision-language models (VLMs), Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct, and explains how their architectural properties map to a practical video-to-artifact pipeline implemented in the BodyLanguageDetection repository [1]. The system samples video frames, prompts a VLM to detect visible people and generate pixel-space bounding boxes with prompt-conditioned attributes (emotion by default), validates output structure using a predefined schema, and optionally renders an annotated video. We first summarize the shared multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, and instruction following), then describe each architecture at a level sufficient to justify engineering choices without speculative internals. Finally, we connect model behavior to system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid while semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric correctness), person identifiers are frame-local in the current prompting contract, and interactive single-frame analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON. These distinctions are critical for writing defensible claims, designing robust interfaces, and planning evaluation.

TL;DR: Co2S is a stable semi-supervised remote sensing image segmentation framework that combines CLIP and DINOv3 vision foundation models to address pseudo-label drift through heterogeneous dual-student architecture with explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance and global-local feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-supervised remote sensing image segmentation suffers from pseudo-label drift where confirmation bias leads to error accumulation during training, creating a need for more stable approaches.

Method: Proposes Co2S with: 1) Heterogeneous dual-student architecture using ViT-based models initialized with CLIP and DINOv3; 2) Explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance using text embeddings (explicit) and learnable queries (implicit); 3) Global-local feature collaborative fusion to combine CLIP's global context with DINOv3's local details.

Result: Extensive experiments on six popular datasets show leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios, demonstrating superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: Co2S effectively mitigates pseudo-label drift in semi-supervised remote sensing segmentation by synergistically fusing priors from vision-language and self-supervised models through innovative architectural and guidance mechanisms.

Abstract: Semi-supervised remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation offers a promising solution to alleviate the burden of exhaustive annotation, yet it fundamentally struggles with pseudo-label drift, a phenomenon where confirmation bias leads to the accumulation of errors during training. In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: LAM3C learns 3D representations from unlabeled videos without real 3D sensors, achieving state-of-the-art self-supervised performance on indoor segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting large-scale 3D scene scans is expensive and labor-intensive, while unlabeled videos are abundant and easier to obtain. The paper investigates whether 3D representations can be learned from videos without real 3D sensors.

Method: Proposes LAM3C framework with: 1) RoomTours dataset - 49,219 scenes from room-walkthrough videos using off-the-shelf reconstruction; 2) Noise-regularized loss enforcing local geometric smoothness and feature stability under noisy point clouds; 3) Laplacian-aware multi-level 3D clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm.

Result: Without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Unlabeled videos represent an abundant and effective source of data for 3D self-supervised learning, potentially reducing the need for expensive 3D sensor data collection.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D self-supervised learning, collecting large-scale 3D scene scans remains expensive and labor-intensive. In this work, we investigate whether 3D representations can be learned from unlabeled videos recorded without any real 3D sensors. We present Laplacian-Aware Multi-level 3D Clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp (LAM3C), a self-supervised framework that learns from video-generated point clouds from unlabeled videos. We first introduce RoomTours, a video-generated point cloud dataset constructed by collecting room-walkthrough videos from the web (e.g., real-estate tours) and generating 49,219 scenes using an off-the-shelf feed-forward reconstruction model. We also propose a noise-regularized loss that stabilizes representation learning by enforcing local geometric smoothness and ensuring feature stability under noisy point clouds. Remarkably, without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than the previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation. These results suggest that unlabeled videos represent an abundant source of data for 3D self-supervised learning.

*Zhengyang Liang,Yan Shu,Xiangrui Liu,Minghao Qin,Kaixin Liang,Paolo Rota,Nicu Sebe,Zheng Liu,Lizi Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-BrowseComp is a new benchmark for evaluating agentic video reasoning that requires actively navigating video timelines and verifying claims against the open web, unlike existing passive video perception benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a significant modality gap in processing video content for autonomous agents. While textual and static multimodal agents have progressed, existing video benchmarks focus on passive perception of curated clips rather than active, open-ended web research that requires temporal evidence gathering and verification.

Method: Created Video-BrowseComp benchmark with 210 questions specifically designed for open-web agentic video reasoning. The benchmark enforces mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring answers cannot be derived through text search alone but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals critical limitations: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 achieve only 15.24% accuracy. Models rely heavily on textual proxies, performing well in metadata-rich domains but failing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments where visual grounding is essential.

Conclusion: Video-BrowseComp advances the field beyond passive video perception toward proactive video reasoning, highlighting the need for better agentic video research capabilities and exposing current model limitations in processing dynamic visual content from the open web.

Abstract: The evolution of autonomous agents is redefining information seeking, transitioning from passive retrieval to proactive, open-ended web research. However, while textual and static multimodal agents have seen rapid progress, a significant modality gap remains in processing the web's most dynamic modality: video. Existing video benchmarks predominantly focus on passive perception, feeding curated clips to models without requiring external retrieval. They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Video-BrowseComp}, a challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, Video-BrowseComp enforces a mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring that answers cannot be derived solely through text search but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a critical bottleneck: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals that these models largely rely on textual proxies, excelling in metadata-rich domains (e.g., TV shows with plot summaries) but collapsing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments (e.g., sports, gameplay) where visual grounding is essential. As the first open-web video research benchmark, Video-BrowseComp advances the field beyond passive perception toward proactive video reasoning.

*Brayden Miao,Zain Rehman,Xin Miao,Siming Liu,Jianjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline using fine-tuned MedSAM for lung extraction improves multi-label abnormality classification, with masking effects being task- and architecture-dependent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated CXR interpretation faces challenges due to weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision. Foundation models like MedSAM offer anatomically grounded priors that could improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis.

Method: Proposed a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline: 1) Fine-tuned MedSAM on public image-mask dataset for lung region extraction, 2) Applied to NIH CXR dataset subset, 3) Trained deep CNNs (ResNet50) for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, Fibrosis) with normal case evaluation via derived score, 4) Compared original images vs. loose/tight lung masking approaches.

Result: MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. ResNet50 on original images achieves strongest overall abnormality discrimination. Loose masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination. Tight masking reduces abnormality performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates degradation by preserving perihilar/peripheral context.

Conclusion: Lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone architecture and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly. There's a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is widely used for screening and diagnosing pulmonary abnormalities, yet automated interpretation remains challenging due to weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision. Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly.

*Jian Wang,Sixing Rong,Jiarui Xing,Yuling Xu,Weide Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathoSyn is a unified generative framework for MRI image synthesis that disentangles anatomical structure from pathological deviations using a deviation-space diffusion model, producing high-fidelity synthetic medical images with preserved anatomical integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for medical imaging suffer from feature entanglement when operating in global pixel domains or using binary masks, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates and structural discontinuities. There's a need for a method that can generate realistic pathological variations while preserving underlying healthy anatomy.

Method: PathoSyn decomposes MRI synthesis into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. It uses a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model to learn conditional distributions of pathological residuals, coupled with seam-aware fusion and inference-time stabilization modules to ensure spatial coherence and suppress boundary artifacts.

Result: PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity on tumor imaging benchmarks. The framework generates high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets with interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling.

Conclusion: PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating realistic medical images that preserve anatomical integrity while modeling pathological variations. This enables robust diagnostic algorithm development in low-data regimes, supports precision intervention planning, and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems.

Abstract: We present PathoSyn, a unified generative framework for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image synthesis that reformulates imaging-pathology as a disentangled additive deviation on a stable anatomical manifold. Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity. The source code of this work will be made publicly available.

### [181] [Domain-Shift Immunity in Deep Deformable Registration via Local Feature Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23142)
*Mingzhen Shao,Sarang Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep deformable registration models are inherently robust to domain shift due to their reliance on local features rather than global appearance, challenging the common belief that they need diverse training data for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why learning-based deformable registration models show robustness to domain shift despite training on limited data, challenging the conventional wisdom that large diverse datasets are needed for robustness.

Method: Introduces UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network, trained on a single dataset.

Result: UniReg shows robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods despite single-dataset training. Analysis reveals that conventional CNN failures under modality shift come from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers.

Conclusion: Domain-shift immunity is inherent in deep deformable registration due to local feature reliance. Local feature consistency drives robustness, motivating backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced deformable image registration, surpassing traditional optimization-based methods in both accuracy and efficiency. However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers. These findings identify local feature consistency as the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration and motivate backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features.

TL;DR: GeoTeacher is a semi-supervised 3D object detection method that enhances geometric understanding through keypoint-based supervision and voxel-wise augmentation with distance-decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised 3D detection methods overlook that models with limited labeled data struggle to capture geometric information, which is crucial for object perception and localization.

Method: Proposes GeoTeacher with: 1) keypoint-based geometric relation supervision to transfer teacher's geometry knowledge to student, 2) voxel-wise data augmentation with distance-decay mechanism to increase geometric diversity while preserving distant objects.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on ONCE and Waymo datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and generalization. Can be combined with other SS3D methods for further improvements.

Conclusion: GeoTeacher effectively enhances geometric understanding in semi-supervised 3D detection, addressing a key limitation of previous methods and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection, aiming to explore unlabeled data for boosting 3D object detectors, has emerged as an active research area in recent years. Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: REVEALER is a unified framework for element-level alignment evaluation of text-to-image models using reinforcement-guided visual reasoning with MLLMs, achieving SOTA performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for text-to-image alignment rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines that lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences.

Method: REVEALER uses a structured "grounding-reasoning-conclusion" paradigm with Multimodal Large Language Models to localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization with composite rewards for format, grounding accuracy, and alignment fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments across four benchmarks (EvalMuse-40K, RichHF, MHaluBench, GenAI-Bench) show REVEALER achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming proprietary models and supervised baselines with superior inference efficiency compared to iterative visual reasoning methods.

Conclusion: REVEALER provides a unified, interpretable framework for fine-grained element-level alignment evaluation of text-to-image models that better reflects human preferences while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Evaluating the alignment between textual prompts and generated images is critical for ensuring the reliability and usability of text-to-image (T2I) models. However, most existing evaluation methods rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines, which lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences. To address this, we propose REVEALER, a unified framework for element-level alignment evaluation based on reinforcement-guided visual reasoning. Adopting a structured "grounding-reasoning-conclusion" paradigm, our method enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments. We optimize the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) using a composite reward function that incorporates structural format, grounding accuracy, and alignment fidelity. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks-EvalMuse-40K, RichHF, MHaluBench, and GenAI-Bench-demonstrate that REVEALER achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our approach consistently outperforms both strong proprietary models and supervised baselines while demonstrating superior inference efficiency compared to existing iterative visual reasoning methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GVSynergy-Det is a novel image-based 3D object detection framework that synergistically combines Gaussian and voxel representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance without requiring depth sensors or dense 3D supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based 3D detection faces a dilemma: accurate methods need dense 3D supervision, while unsupervised methods struggle with geometry extraction. There's a need for accurate 3D detection without expensive depth sensors or dense supervision.

Method: Uses dual-representation architecture with continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations. Adapts Gaussian Splatting for geometric features and develops cross-representation enhancement to enrich voxel features with Gaussian geometric details. Features from both representations are integrated through learnable mechanisms.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks (ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes), significantly outperforming existing methods without requiring depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (point clouds or TSDF).

Conclusion: The synergistic combination of Gaussian and voxel representations enables accurate 3D object detection from RGB images alone, overcoming limitations of previous methods that required dense supervision or struggled with geometry extraction.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection aims to identify and localize objects in 3D space using only RGB images, eliminating the need for expensive depth sensors required by point cloud-based methods. Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).

TL;DR: A unified Driving World Model framework using 3D Gaussian scene representation that enables 3D scene understanding and multi-modal generation with early modality alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Driving World Models lack 3D scene understanding capabilities, can only generate content conditioned on input data without reasoning about the driving environment, and current 3D representations (point clouds/BEV features) don't accurately align textual information with 3D scenes.

Method: Proposes a unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation that embeds linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive for early modality alignment. Includes task-aware language-guided sampling to remove redundant Gaussians and inject compact 3D tokens into LLM, plus a dual-condition multi-modal generation model combining high-level language conditions with low-level image conditions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and NuInteract datasets, validating the effectiveness of the framework for both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D Gaussian-based framework successfully addresses limitations of existing DWMs by enabling both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal generation with proper textual-3D alignment, representing a significant advancement in driving world modeling.

Abstract: Driving World Models (DWMs) have been developing rapidly with the advances of generative models. However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We will release the code publicly on GitHub https://github.com/dtc111111/GaussianDWM.

Result: ForCM significantly improves accuracy: ResUNet-OBIA achieves 94.54% and AttentionUNet-OBIA achieves 95.64% overall accuracy, compared to 92.91% with traditional OBIA alone.

Conclusion: The proposed ForCM method successfully enhances forest cover mapping accuracy by combining DL with OBIA, demonstrating the potential of free tools like QGIS for environmental monitoring despite their limitations.

Abstract: This research proposes "ForCM", a novel approach to forest cover mapping that combines Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) with Deep Learning (DL) using multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. The study explores several DL models, including UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, and ResNet50-Segnet, applied to high-resolution Sentinel-2 Level 2A satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest. The datasets comprise three collections: two sets of three-band imagery and one set of four-band imagery. After evaluation, the most effective DL models are individually integrated with the OBIA technique to enhance mapping accuracy. The originality of this work lies in evaluating different deep learning models combined with OBIA and comparing them with traditional OBIA methods. The results show that the proposed ForCM method improves forest cover mapping, achieving overall accuracies of 94.54 percent with ResUNet-OBIA and 95.64 percent with AttentionUNet-OBIA, compared to 92.91 percent using traditional OBIA. This research also demonstrates the potential of free and user-friendly tools such as QGIS for accurate mapping within their limitations, supporting global environmental monitoring and conservation efforts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using Unreal Engine to generate synthetic RGB data for military target detection to address high costs of SAR data and lack of military datasets, benchmarking domain adaptation methods on synthetic-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Military object detection faces challenges: current domain adaptation methods only handle similar natural/autonomous driving scenes, not mixed military environments; SAR data is robust but expensive; RGB cameras are affordable but lack military datasets; need for cross-domain military target detection.

Method: Generate synthetic RGB data using Unreal Engine photorealistic visual tool for military target detection; conduct synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training on synthetic dataset and validating on web-collected real military target datasets; benchmark state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods with varying supervision levels.

Result: Methods using minimal hints (e.g., object class) achieve substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised domain adaptation methods; identified current challenges that remain to be overcome in cross-domain military target detection.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation using Unreal Engine is a viable approach for military target detection when real data is scarce; supervised domain adaptation with minimal hints outperforms unsupervised/semi-supervised methods; highlights remaining challenges in cross-domain military object detection.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the key target tasks of interest in the context of civil and military applications. In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. From these observations, we recognize the current challenges that remain to be overcome.

*Changgyoon Oh,Jongoh Jeong,Jegyeong Cho,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to adaptively select and consolidate diffusion timestep features for few-shot dense prediction tasks, improving performance over heuristic timestep selection approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models use heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features for single-task prediction, which leads to sub-optimal performance biased toward certain tasks. There's a need for more systematic and adaptive timestep feature selection for few-shot dense prediction tasks.

Method: Proposes two modules: 1) Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and 2) Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate selected timestep features. Uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter for few-shot learning.

Result: Empirically validated on the large-scale Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction tasks. The framework achieves superior dense prediction performance given only a few support queries in practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive timestep selection and consolidation method effectively addresses the limitations of heuristic timestep feature selection, improving few-shot dense prediction performance across arbitrary unseen tasks.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have brought tremendous advances in generative tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance thus far. Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries. We empirically validate our learnable timestep consolidation method on the large-scale challenging Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction, particularly for practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios.

*Jongoh Jeong,Taek-Jin Song,Jong-Hwan Kim,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVOID dataset for real-time obstacle detection in adverse conditions with multi-modal data (images, semantic/depth maps, LiDAR, waypoints) collected in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing road datasets lack diverse adverse conditions and consistent visual domains for small road hazards, limiting reliable real-time detection for self-driving cars.

Method: Introduce AVOID dataset collected in simulated environment with various weather/time conditions, containing images, semantic/depth maps, LiDAR data, and waypoints.

Result: Benchmark results on real-time networks for obstacle detection, plus ablation studies with multi-task network for semantic segmentation, depth, and waypoint prediction.

Conclusion: AVOID addresses dataset limitations for adverse condition obstacle detection and supports comprehensive visual perception tasks for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Understanding road scenes for visual perception remains crucial for intelligent self-driving cars. In particular, it is desirable to detect unexpected small road hazards reliably in real-time, especially under varying adverse conditions (e.g., weather and daylight). However, existing road driving datasets provide large-scale images acquired in either normal or adverse scenarios only, and often do not contain the road obstacles captured in the same visual domain as for the other classes. To address this, we introduce a new dataset called AVOID, the Adverse Visual Conditions Dataset, for real-time obstacle detection collected in a simulated environment. AVOID consists of a large set of unexpected road obstacles located along each path captured under various weather and time conditions. Each image is coupled with the corresponding semantic and depth maps, raw and semantic LiDAR data, and waypoints, thereby supporting most visual perception tasks. We benchmark the results on high-performing real-time networks for the obstacle detection task, and also propose and conduct ablation studies using a comprehensive multi-task network for semantic segmentation, depth and waypoint prediction tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-UAVBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in low-altitude UAV scenarios, covering perception, cognition, and planning capabilities with 19 sub-tasks and 5.7K+ questions from real-world UAV data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks don't adequately address low-altitude UAV scenarios, and existing UAV evaluations focus on specific tasks rather than assessing general intelligence. There's a gap in unified evaluation of MLLMs' capabilities in complex low-altitude environments.

Method: Created MM-UAVBench with 19 sub-tasks across three core dimensions: perception, cognition, and planning. Used over 5.7K manually annotated questions derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Evaluated 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs.

Result: Current MLLMs struggle to adapt to complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude UAV scenarios. Analysis revealed critical bottlenecks including spatial bias and multi-view understanding issues that hinder effective deployment in UAV applications.

Conclusion: MM-UAVBench addresses the gap in evaluating MLLMs for low-altitude UAV intelligence and reveals current limitations. The benchmark aims to foster research on developing more robust and reliable MLLMs for real-world UAV applications.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable general intelligence across diverse domains, their potential in low-altitude applications dominated by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) remains largely underexplored. Existing MLLM benchmarks rarely cover the unique challenges of low-altitude scenarios, while UAV-related evaluations mainly focus on specific tasks such as localization or navigation, without a unified evaluation of MLLMs'general intelligence. To bridge this gap, we present MM-UAVBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across three core capability dimensions-perception, cognition, and planning-in low-altitude UAV scenarios. MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveal that current models struggle to adapt to the complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios. Our analyses further uncover critical bottlenecks such as spatial bias and multi-view understanding that hinder the effective deployment of MLLMs in UAV scenarios. We hope MM-UAVBench will foster future research on robust and reliable MLLMs for real-world UAV intelligence.

*Youngchae Kwon,Jinyoung Choi,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Holi-DETR: A transformer-based fashion item detector that uses holistic contextual information (co-occurrence, spatial arrangements, body keypoints) to reduce ambiguities in fashion item detection, improving performance over vanilla DETR and Co-DETR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fashion item detection is challenging due to diverse appearances and similarities among subcategories. Conventional detectors work independently per item, missing important contextual relationships that could help resolve ambiguities.

Method: Proposes Holi-DETR, a novel architecture that integrates three types of contextual information into DETR: (1) co-occurrence relationships between fashion items, (2) relative position/size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) spatial relationships between items and human body keypoints.

Result: Improved performance over vanilla DETR by 3.6 percentage points (pp) and over Co-DETR by 1.1 pp in terms of average precision (AP).

Conclusion: Holistic detection leveraging contextual information effectively reduces ambiguities in fashion item detection, demonstrating the importance of considering relationships between items and body context for improved accuracy.

Abstract: Fashion item detection is challenging due to the ambiguities introduced by the highly diverse appearances of fashion items and the similarities among item subcategories. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models. In experiments, the proposed methods improved the performance of the vanilla DETR and the more recently developed Co-DETR by 3.6 percent points (pp) and 1.1 pp, respectively, in terms of average precision (AP).

*Jiaxu Zhang,Tianshu Hu,Yuan Zhang,Zenan Li,Linjie Luo,Guosheng Lin,Xin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMAGE is a unified director model that combines script drafting and key-shot design into a single framework using Mixture-of-Transformers architecture and a novel "first interleaving, then disentangling" training paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI video creation systems treat script drafting (using LLMs) and key-shot design (using image generation models) as separate tasks, but these should be unified since logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both essential qualities of a film director.

Method: Uses Mixture-of-Transformers architecture to unify text and image generation. Introduces "first interleaving, then disentangling" training: 1) Interleaved Concept Learning with text-image data for deeper script understanding, 2) Disentangled Expert Learning to decouple script writing from keyframe generation for flexibility.

Result: UniMAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images, enabling non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films.

Conclusion: Unifying script drafting and key-shot design within a single framework is effective for AI-driven video creation, with the proposed architecture and training paradigm enabling coherent storytelling and consistent visual generation.

Abstract: Existing AI-driven video creation systems typically treat script drafting and key-shot design as two disjoint tasks: the former relies on large language models, while the latter depends on image generation models. We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel framework using pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation and image retrieval models to efficiently generate high-quality synthetic defect images for anomaly detection, with a two-stage training strategy to maximize performance while minimizing cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in industrial manufacturing suffers from scarcity of real defect images. Existing synthesis approaches present a trade-off: rule-based methods are cost-effective but produce unrealistic defects, while generative model-based methods create high-quality defects but are expensive. There's a need for an efficient approach that generates realistic defect images without substantial cost.

Method: 1) Uses pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model to generate synthetic defect images. 2) Employs image retrieval model to assess similarity to real normal images and filter irrelevant outputs. 3) Implements two-stage training: pre-training on large volume of rule-based synthetic images, then fine-tuning on smaller set of high-quality generated images.

Result: Experiments on MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The framework significantly reduces data collection costs while improving anomaly detection performance compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the trade-off between cost and quality in synthetic defect image generation for anomaly detection. By combining efficient generation with quality filtering and strategic training, it achieves improved performance with reduced resource requirements, offering a practical solution for industrial applications.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing. Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: SGPS uses SURE gradient updates and PCA noise estimation to correct diffusion sampling errors, enabling high-quality inverse problem reconstruction with <100 NFEs instead of hundreds/thousands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based inverse problem solving requires hundreds/thousands of steps due to error accumulation from alternating diffusion sampling and data consistency steps, limiting efficiency.

Method: SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS) corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA-based noise estimation to mitigate noise-induced errors during early/middle sampling stages.

Result: SGPS maintains high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) and consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts across diverse inverse problems.

Conclusion: SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling with reduced error accumulation, making diffusion-based inverse problem solving significantly more efficient while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful learned priors for solving inverse problems. However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts.

TL;DR: PEG-DRNet is a physics-edge hybrid network for infrared gas leak detection that combines gas transport modeling with edge-aware feature routing to detect faint, small, semitransparent gas plumes with weak boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared gas leak detection is challenging because plumes are faint, small, semitransparent, and have weak, diffuse boundaries, making traditional detection methods ineffective.

Method: Three main components: 1) Gas Block with diffusion-convection modeling for gas transport, 2) AGPEO edge operator for reliable edge priors, 3) CASR-PAN network for adaptive feature routing based on edge and content cues.

Result: Achieves 29.8% overall AP, 84.3% AP50, and 25.3% small-object AP on IIG dataset, surpassing RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0%, 6.5%, and 5.3% respectively, with only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9M parameters.

Conclusion: PEG-DRNet achieves superior performance with the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming existing CNN and Transformer detectors on IIG and LangGas datasets.

Abstract: Detecting infrared gas leaks is critical for environmental monitoring and industrial safety, yet remains difficult because plumes are faint, small, semitransparent, and have weak, diffuse boundaries. We present physics-edge hybrid gas dynamic routing network (PEG-DRNet). First, we introduce the Gas Block, a diffusion-convection unit modeling gas transport: a local branch captures short-range variations, while a large-kernel branch captures long-range propagation. An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses. These are transformed by a multi-scale edge perception module (MSEPM) into hierarchical edge features that reinforce boundaries. Finally, the content-adaptive sparse routing path aggregation network (CASR-PAN), with adaptive information modulation modules for fusion and self, selectively propagates informative features across scales based on edge and content cues, improving cross-scale discriminability while reducing redundancy. Experiments on the IIG dataset show that PEG-DRNet achieves an overall AP of 29.8\%, an AP$_{50}$ of 84.3\%, and a small-object AP of 25.3\%, surpassing the RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0\%, 6.5\%, and 5.3\%, respectively, while requiring only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9 M parameters. The proposed PEG-DRNet achieves superior overall performance with the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming existing CNN and Transformer detectors in AP and AP$_{50}$ on the IIG and LangGas dataset.

TL;DR: A training-free, two-stage data pruning method for RS diffusion foundation models that selects high-quality subsets under high pruning ratios to improve training efficiency and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RS diffusion foundation models rely on large datasets with redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, which reduce training efficiency and prevent convergence. Existing approaches use simplistic deduplication or aggregated classification datasets that overlook generation modeling requirements and RS imagery heterogeneity.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Entropy-based criterion removes low-information samples, 2) Scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling using RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness for fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios.

Result: Method significantly improves convergence and generation quality even after pruning 85% of training data. Diffusion foundation models trained with this approach achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed data pruning paradigm provides practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models by enabling efficient training with high-quality subsets while preserving diversity and representativeness.

Abstract: Diffusion-based remote sensing (RS) generative foundation models are cruial for downstream tasks. However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis. This data pruning paradigm offers practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models.

Conclusion: Provides novel approach for constructing efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying theoretical foundation and offering technical guidance for intelligent remote sensing interpretation engineering applications.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion of remote sensing images serves as a core technology for overcoming the limitations of single-source data and improving the accuracy of surface information extraction, which exhibits significant application value in fields such as environmental monitoring and urban planning. To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pixel-based methods and encoder-decoder networks fail to capture high-level semantics and are vulnerable to non-semantic perturbations. Recent VLM-based approaches still struggle with inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise boundaries, and limited interpretability.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) - VLM trained via SFT and RL on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking image patches and outputting coarse change masks; 2) Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD) - integrates dual-temporal image features with coarse mask to predict precise binary change maps.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks show ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: ViLaCD-R1 effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by combining semantic understanding from VLMs with precise localization capabilities, offering a robust solution for remote sensing change detection.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD), a complex multi-image inference task, traditionally uses pixel-based operators or encoder-decoder networks that inadequately capture high-level semantics and are vulnerable to non-semantic perturbations. Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle with generating sequences of images that maintain consistent character identity across different scene descriptions, facing a trade-off between identity consistency and per-image prompt alignment.

Method: The framework uses selective text embedding modification for explicit semantic control, repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers based on FLUX analysis, implements adaptive feature-sharing that evaluates textual ambiguity, and applies constraints only to ambiguous identity prompts.

Result: ASemconsist achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs between identity consistency and prompt alignment.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a comprehensive solution for character-consistent image generation with novel semantic control strategies and a unified evaluation metric (CQS) that captures performance imbalances between identity preservation and text alignment.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved visual quality and text alignment. However, generating a sequence of images while preserving consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between maintaining identity consistency and ensuring per-image prompt alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs. Project page: https://minjung-s.github.io/asemconsist

TL;DR: Contour-aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates segmentation priors to preserve edge structures under high compression, achieving better reconstruction quality with few Gaussians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D Gaussian Splatting methods produce blurry boundaries when using few Gaussians due to lack of contour awareness, limiting their effectiveness in high compression scenarios.

Method: Proposes a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that constrains each Gaussian to specific segmentation regions during rasterization to prevent cross-boundary blending, plus a warm-up scheme for stable training.

Result: Achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods, especially with very few Gaussians, while maintaining fast rendering and low memory usage.

Conclusion: Incorporating segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation effectively preserves edge structures under high compression, making 2DGS more practical for lightweight image representation.

Abstract: Image representation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence. Experiments on synthetic color charts and the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods. The improvement is particularly evident in scenarios with very few Gaussians, while our method still maintains fast rendering and low memory usage.

*Tong Shao,Yusen Fu,Guoying Sun,Jingde Kong,Zhuotao Tian,Jingyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CEM is a fidelity-optimization plugin that minimizes caching errors in Diffusion Transformers through dynamic programming, improving generation fidelity without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have slow inference due to iterative denoising. Existing caching-based acceleration methods suffer from computational errors, and their fixed caching strategies can't adapt to complex error variations during denoising.

Method: Proposes CEM (cumulative error minimization) plugin that predefines error characterization based on timesteps and cache intervals, then uses dynamic programming with cumulative error approximation to optimize caching strategies for error minimization.

Result: CEM significantly improves generation fidelity across 9 models and quantized methods in 3 tasks, outperforming original performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-α, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan. Works with arbitrary acceleration budgets.

Conclusion: CEM is a model-agnostic, training-free plugin that optimizes caching strategies via cumulative error minimization, substantially improving diffusion model acceleration fidelity without extra computational overhead.

Abstract: Although Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a predominant architecture for image and video generation, its iterative denoising process results in slow inference, which hinders broader applicability and development. Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$α$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan. The code will be made publicly available.

*Xu Lin,Jinlong Peng,Zhenye Gan,Jiawen Zhu,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO-Master introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for real-time object detection using sparse Mixture-of-Experts to dynamically allocate resources based on scene complexity, achieving better accuracy and speed than YOLOv13-N.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current YOLO-like real-time object detection models use static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, leading to computational redundancy (over-allocating on simple scenes) and suboptimal performance (under-serving complex scenes). This mismatch wastes representational capacity and computational resources.

Method: Proposes YOLO-Master framework with Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources based on scene complexity. Uses lightweight dynamic routing network to guide expert specialization during training with diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise. The routing network learns to activate only relevant experts during inference to minimize computational overhead.

Result: Achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency on MS COCO, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes while maintaining efficiency on typical inputs and preserving real-time inference speed. Validated on five large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: YOLO-Master successfully addresses the limitations of static computation in RTOD by introducing instance-conditional adaptive computation, achieving superior accuracy-speed trade-off, especially for complex scenes, while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Existing Real-Time Object Detection (RTOD) methods commonly adopt YOLO-like architectures for their favorable trade-off between accuracy and speed. However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed. Code will be available.

TL;DR: The paper presents multimodal frameworks for micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction using RGB video and skeletal pose data, achieving 2nd place in the MiGA 2025 Challenge emotion prediction task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction are challenging tasks requiring modeling of subtle, fine-grained human behaviors from video and skeletal pose data. The iMiGUE dataset provides a benchmark for these tasks, and the MiGA 2025 Challenge offers a competitive platform to advance research in this area.

Method: Two multimodal frameworks: 1) For micro-gesture classification, uses MViTv2-S for video embeddings and 2s-AGCN for skeletal embeddings, integrated via Cross-Modal Token Fusion module. 2) For emotion recognition, uses SwinFace for facial embeddings and MViTv2-S for contextual embeddings, fused through an InterFusion module to capture emotional expressions and body gestures.

Result: Experiments on iMiGUE dataset demonstrate robust performance and accuracy, particularly in behavior-based emotion prediction where the approach secured 2nd place in the MiGA 2025 Challenge.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal frameworks effectively leverage complementary visual modalities (RGB video, skeletal pose, facial features) to address challenging tasks of micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction, showing competitive performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction are both highly challenging tasks that require modeling subtle, fine-grained human behaviors, primarily leveraging video and skeletal pose data. In this work, we present two multimodal frameworks designed to tackle both problems on the iMiGUE dataset. For micro-gesture classification, we explore the complementary strengths of RGB and 3D pose-based representations to capture nuanced spatio-temporal patterns. To comprehensively represent gestures, video, and skeletal embeddings are extracted using MViTv2-S and 2s-AGCN, respectively. Then, they are integrated through a Cross-Modal Token Fusion module to combine spatial and pose information. For emotion recognition, our framework extends to behavior-based emotion prediction, a binary classification task identifying emotional states based on visual cues. We leverage facial and contextual embeddings extracted using SwinFace and MViTv2-S models and fuse them through an InterFusion module designed to capture emotional expressions and body gestures. Experiments conducted on the iMiGUE dataset, within the scope of the MiGA 2025 Challenge, demonstrate the robust performance and accuracy of our method in the behavior-based emotion prediction task, where our approach secured 2nd place.

This study presents a critical comparison between two fundamentally different AI architectures: the specialized open-source agent MedGemma and the proprietary large multimodal model GPT-4 for diagnosing six different diseases. The MedGemma-4b-it model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), demonstrated superior diagnostic capability by achieving a mean test accuracy of 80.37% compared to 69.58% for the untuned GPT-4. Furthermore, MedGemma exhibited notably higher sensitivity in high-stakes clinical tasks, such as cancer and pneumonia detection. Quantitative analysis via confusion matrices and classification reports provides comprehensive insights into model performance across all categories.

TL;DR: CME-CAD: A heterogeneous collaborative multi-expert reinforcement learning paradigm for generating high-precision, editable CAD models from orthographic projections with dimension annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAD modeling is complex, and existing sketch-to-3D methods produce non-editable, approximate models that don't meet industrial precision requirements. Text/image-based approaches require manual annotation, limiting scalability in industrial settings.

Method: Proposes CME-CAD paradigm with two-stage training: 1) Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT) and 2) Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL). Integrates complementary strengths of models for collaborative learning. Also introduces CADExpert benchmark with 17,299 instances including orthographic projections, dimension annotations, CoT processes, CADQuery code, and 3D models.

Result: The approach generates accurate, constraint-compatible, and fully editable CAD models from orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Conclusion: CME-CAD paradigm enables automated generation of industrial-grade CAD models with high precision and editability, addressing key challenges in CAD automation through collaborative multi-expert learning and comprehensive benchmarking.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is essential in industrial design, but the complexity of traditional CAD modeling and workflows presents significant challenges for automating the generation of high-precision, editable CAD models. Existing methods that reconstruct 3D models from sketches often produce non-editable and approximate models that fall short of meeting the stringent requirements for precision and editability in industrial design. Moreover, the reliance on text or image-based inputs often requires significant manual annotation, limiting their scalability and applicability in industrial settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CME-CAD) paradigm, a novel training paradigm for CAD code generation. Our approach integrates the complementary strengths of these models, facilitating collaborative learning and improving the model's ability to generate accurate, constraint-compatible, and fully editable CAD models. We introduce a two-stage training process: Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT), and Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL). Additionally, we present CADExpert, an open-source benchmark consisting of 17,299 instances, including orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations, expert-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, executable CADQuery code, and rendered 3D models.

### [206] [Visual Language Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23335)
*Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual representation learning requires a fiber bundle structure where semantic states form a quotient space, necessitating discriminative targets and architectural mechanisms for topology change.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand visual representation learning from structural and topological perspectives, starting from the hypothesis that visual understanding requires a semantic language where many perceptual observations map to few discrete semantic states.

Method: Theoretical analysis using fiber bundle structures: visual observation space organized as fiber bundle (nuisance variation in fibers, semantics in quotient base space). Derives two consequences: 1) semantic quotient cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, requires discriminative targets; 2) model architecture must support topology change via "expand-and-snap" process.

Result: Framework provides topological interpretation aligning with empirical regularities in large-scale discriminative/multimodal models and classical statistical learning theory. Shows semantic invariance requires non-homeomorphic, discriminative targets (labels, cross-instance identification, multimodal alignment).

Conclusion: Visual representation learning fundamentally requires both external semantic targets and architectural mechanisms capable of supporting topology change (expand-and-snap process). The topological framework offers interpretive insights rather than prescriptive guidance.

Abstract: We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.

### [207] [CountGD++: Generalized Prompting for Open-World Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23351)
*Niki Amini-Naieni,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountGD++ introduces novel prompt flexibility for object counting by allowing specification of what NOT to count, automating visual example annotation with pseudo-exemplars, and accepting both natural/synthetic external images, significantly improving accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object counting methods have limited flexibility in how objects can be specified - they require manual annotation of visual examples and cannot specify what objects NOT to count, restricting their practical utility.

Method: Extends counting prompts to include negative specifications (what not to count) via text/visual examples, introduces pseudo-exemplars for automated visual example annotation at inference, and accepts visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images.

Result: Significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across multiple datasets, with CountGD++ serving as a vision expert agent for LLMs in multi-modal open-world counting tasks.

Conclusion: The novel prompt flexibility capabilities expand multi-modal open-world counting, making object counting more practical and accurate while enabling integration with LLMs as vision expert agents.

Abstract: The flexibility and accuracy of methods for automatically counting objects in images and videos are limited by the way the object can be specified. While existing methods allow users to describe the target object with text and visual examples, the visual examples must be manually annotated inside the image, and there is no way to specify what not to count. To address these gaps, we introduce novel capabilities that expand how the target object can be specified. Specifically, we extend the prompt to enable what not to count to be described with text and/or visual examples, introduce the concept of `pseudo-exemplars' that automate the annotation of visual examples at inference, and extend counting models to accept visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images. We also use our new counting model, CountGD++, as a vision expert agent for an LLM. Together, these contributions expand the prompt flexibility of multi-modal open-world counting and lead to significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: SpatialMosaic: A scalable framework for multi-view spatial reasoning with 2M QA dataset, challenging benchmark, and hybrid VLM architecture integrating 3D geometry encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs for 3D scene understanding rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or reconstruction pipelines, limiting scalability and real-world applicability. Current multi-view approaches don't adequately address real-world challenges like partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions requiring reasoning from fragmented visual cues.

Method: 1) Scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline creating realistic spatial reasoning QAs (SpatialMosaic dataset with 2M QA pairs). 2) SpatialMosaic-Bench benchmark with 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning. 3) SpatialMosaicVLM hybrid framework integrating 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within VLMs.

Result: Extensive experiments show the dataset and VQA tasks effectively enhance spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view conditions, validating the effectiveness of the data generation pipeline in constructing realistic and diverse QA pairs.

Conclusion: The proposed SpatialMosaic framework addresses key limitations in multi-view spatial reasoning by providing scalable data generation, challenging evaluation benchmarks, and a hybrid architecture that integrates 3D geometry understanding, enabling more robust spatial reasoning in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for enhanced 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning. However, existing approaches often rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or off-the-shelf reconstruction pipelines, which constrain scalability and real-world applicability. A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks. In addition, we present SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework that integrates 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within VLMs for robust spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and VQA tasks effectively enhance spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view conditions, validating the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline in constructing realistic and diverse QA pairs. Code and dataset will be available soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-view correspondence methods have limitations in local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization, making it difficult to accurately capture geometric constraints and reducing model robustness.

Method: Proposes Multi-Graph Contextual Attention Network (MGCA-Net) with two modules: Contextual Geometric Attention (CGA) that dynamically integrates spatial position and feature information via adaptive attention, and Cross-Stage Multi-Graph Consensus (CSMGC) that establishes geometric consensus via cross-stage sparse graph network.

Result: MGCA-Net significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets for outlier rejection and camera pose estimation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed MGCA-Net effectively addresses geometric modeling limitations in two-view correspondence learning through contextual attention and cross-stage consensus, achieving superior performance in matching and pose estimation applications.

Abstract: Two-view correspondence learning is a key task in computer vision, which aims to establish reliable matching relationships for applications such as camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods have limitations in local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization, which make it difficult to accurately capture the geometric constraints of matched pairs and thus reduce the robustness of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Graph Contextual Attention Network (MGCA-Net), which consists of a Contextual Geometric Attention (CGA) module and a Cross-Stage Multi-Graph Consensus (CSMGC) module. Specifically, CGA dynamically integrates spatial position and feature information via an adaptive attention mechanism and enhances the capability to capture both local and global geometric relationships. Meanwhile, CSMGC establishes geometric consensus via a cross-stage sparse graph network, ensuring the consistency of geometric information across different stages. Experimental results on two representative YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets show that MGCA-Net significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in the outlier rejection and camera pose estimation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeXT-IMDL is a diagnostic benchmark that exposes the fragility of current image manipulation detection methods by systematically testing them across diverse AI-generated content scenarios, revealing significant performance degradation in real-world generalization settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing accessibility and abuse risks of user-friendly image editing models create an urgent need for robust, generalizable Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL) methods. Current cross-dataset evaluation approaches conceal the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, creating misleading impressions of progress.

Method: NeXT-IMDL is a large-scale diagnostic benchmark that categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. It implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols to systematically probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors.

Result: Extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal that while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under protocols simulating real-world, various generalization scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper challenges the illusion of progress in IMDL research and provides a diagnostic toolkit to advance the development of truly robust, next-generation IMDL models that can handle diverse real-world manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: The accessibility surge and abuse risks of user-friendly image editing models have created an urgent need for generalizable, up-to-date methods for Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL). Current IMDL research typically uses cross-dataset evaluation, where models trained on one benchmark are tested on others. However, this simplified evaluation approach conceals the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress. This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios. By providing this diagnostic toolkit and the new findings, we aim to advance the development towards building truly robust, next-generation IMDL models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for real-time audio-driven avatar generation compromise visual fidelity due to computational load vs. latency constraints, requiring either unidirectional attention or reduced model capacity.

Method: Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation retains bidirectional attention within video chunks; Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism prevents collapse during infinite generation; full-stack inference acceleration with hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations.

Result: First 14B-scale system achieving sub-second start-up latency (0.87s) with real-time throughput of 32 FPS, setting new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.

Conclusion: SoulX-LiveTalk successfully addresses the engineering challenge of real-time infinite-duration audio-driven avatar generation by balancing computational efficiency with visual fidelity through novel bidirectional attention and self-correction mechanisms.

Abstract: Deploying massive diffusion models for real-time, infinite-duration, audio-driven avatar generation presents a significant engineering challenge, primarily due to the conflict between computational load and strict latency constraints. Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail. To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-LiveTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.

*Xiaolan Li,Wanquan Liu,Pengcheng Li,Pengyu Jie,Chenqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOFTooth is a 2D-3D fusion framework for 3D tooth instance segmentation that leverages frozen 2D SAM embeddings without 2D mask supervision, addressing challenges like crowded arches, ambiguous boundaries, and rare third molars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D tooth segmentation faces challenges including crowded arches, ambiguous tooth-gingiva boundaries, missing teeth, and rare third molars. Native 3D methods suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, while 2D foundation models like SAM provide strong semantics but are impractical for direct 3D clinical workflows.

Method: SOFTooth uses a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework with three key components: 1) point-wise residual gating module to inject occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features for boundary refinement, 2) center-guided mask refinement for consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, and 3) order-aware Hungarian matching that integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance for coherent labeling.

Result: On 3DTeethSeg'22 dataset, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating effective transfer of 2D semantics to 3D tooth segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed SOFTooth framework effectively addresses 3D tooth segmentation challenges by leveraging frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision, showing that rich 2D semantics can be successfully transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation, particularly benefiting difficult cases like third molars.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) tooth instance segmentation remains challenging due to crowded arches, ambiguous tooth-gingiva boundaries, missing teeth, and rare yet clinically important third molars. Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.

TL;DR: ArtQuant: A new aesthetic quality assessment framework using large-scale RAD dataset and LLM decoders to better model complex aesthetic dimensions in artistic images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current aesthetic assessment systems face two main challenges: 1) data scarcity and imbalance (existing datasets focus too much on visual perception and neglect deeper cognitive/emotional dimensions due to expensive manual annotation), and 2) model fragmentation (current methods either isolate aesthetic attributes or struggle with long-form textual descriptions).

Method: 1) Created Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset - large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset generated via iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs. 2) Proposed ArtQuant framework that couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation and better models long-text semantics using LLM decoders.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs. Theoretical analysis confirms the symbiosis between RAD's semantic adequacy and generation paradigm minimizes prediction entropy.

Conclusion: The approach narrows the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment, providing a more human-aligned quantitative evaluation system for AIGC. Code and dataset will be released to support future research.

Abstract: The aesthetic quality assessment task is crucial for developing a human-aligned quantitative evaluation system for AIGC. However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment. We will release both code and dataset to support future research.

TL;DR: DriveLaW unifies video generation and motion planning for autonomous driving by directly injecting video generator latents into the planner, achieving state-of-the-art results in both tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models for autonomous driving keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes, limiting their effectiveness. The authors aim to bridge this gap by creating a truly unified approach.

Method: DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video (world model for high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations) and DriveLaW-Act (diffusion planner that generates trajectories from DriveLaW-Video's latents). Both components are optimized using a three-stage progressive training strategy.

Result: DriveLaW achieves new state-of-the-art results: surpasses best-performing video prediction work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, and sets a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.

Conclusion: DriveLaW demonstrates the power of unified video generation and motion planning for autonomous driving, ensuring inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning.

Abstract: World models have become crucial for autonomous driving, as they learn how scenarios evolve over time to address the long-tail challenges of the real world. However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.

*Dohyun Kim,Seungwoo Lyu,Seung Wook Kim,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDSPO introduces a novel preference optimization method for diffusion models that uses per-timestep supervision from winning/losing policies without human-labeled data, improving text-image alignment and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with nuanced user intent alignment and consistent aesthetic quality. Existing preference-based methods like DDPO rely on costly, noisy human-labeled datasets, creating a need for more efficient supervision approaches.

Method: DDSPO directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when available. It avoids labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model, contrasting outputs conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants.

Result: DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

Conclusion: DDSPO provides an effective score-space preference supervision approach without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations, offering a practical strategy for enhancing diffusion model performance with reduced supervision costs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, yet they often struggle to fully align outputs with nuanced user intent and maintain consistent aesthetic quality. Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

Abstract: Monitoring states of road surfaces provides valuable information for the planning and controlling vehicles and active vehicle control systems. Classical road monitoring methods are expensive and unsystematic because they require time for measurements. This article proposes an real time system based on weather conditional data and road surface condition data. For this purpose, we collected data with a mobile phone camera on the roads around the campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches. The performances of the simple Alexnet, LeNet, VGG, and Resnet algorithms were compared as deep learning algorithms. For road condition classification, 5 classes were considered: asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road and over 95% accuracy performance was achieved. It is also proposed to use the acceleration or the camera image to classify the road surface according to the weather and the time of day using fuzzy logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce hallucinated content inconsistent with visual inputs, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. Existing methods struggle with balancing high-level semantic consistency and fine-grained visual grounding.

Method: 1) Generate two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of images, 2) Transform responses into synthetic images using text-to-image models to create multi-level visual hypotheses, 3) Use Wasserstein-based fusion to align predictive distributions into geometrically consistent decoding trajectories.

Result: Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic and requires no additional training.

Conclusion: CoFi-Dec provides an effective training-free solution to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs by combining generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning and principled distribution fusion, enhancing reliability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multi-modal understanding and generation. However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous monitoring of river water levels is essential for flood forecasting, water resource management, and ecological protection. Traditional hydrological observation methods are often limited by manual measurement errors and environmental constraints. This study presents a hybrid framework integrating vision based waterline detection, YOLOv8 pose scale extraction, and large multimodal language models (GPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for automated river gauge plate reading. The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation. Overall, the proposed approach offers a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution for automated hydrological monitoring, demonstrating potential for real time river gauge digitization and improved water resource management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic I2I translation needs consistent, predictable outputs that closely match ground truth with high fidelity, but existing methods may lack faithfulness or have unwanted variance.

Method: Proposes a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators - one for forward process and one for reverse process - leveraging Brownian bridge dynamics for faithful I2I translation.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show superior performance in image quality and faithfulness to ground truth compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

Conclusion: Dual-approx Bridge effectively produces faithful output with negligible variance and high image quality in deterministic image-to-image translation tasks.

Abstract: Image-to-Image (I2I) translation involves converting an image from one domain to another. Deterministic I2I translation, such as in image super-resolution, extends this concept by guaranteeing that each input generates a consistent and predictable output, closely matching the ground truth (GT) with high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators (Dual-approx Bridge), a novel generative model that exploits the Brownian bridge dynamics and two neural network-based approximators (one for forward and one for reverse process) to produce faithful output with negligible variance and high image quality in I2I translations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including image generation and super-resolution demonstrate the consistent and superior performance of Dual-approx Bridge in terms of image quality and faithfulness to GT when compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for point cloud registration rely on Euclidean neighborhood-based feature extraction, which fails to capture implicit semantics and structural consistency in point clouds. There's a need for more robust and discriminative feature learning.

Method: Proposes MCI-Net with three key components: 1) Graph neighborhood aggregation module that constructs a global graph to capture overall structural relationships; 2) Progressive context interaction module that enhances feature discriminability through intra-domain feature decoupling and inter-domain context interaction; 3) Dynamic inlier selection method that optimizes inlier weights using residual information from multiple pose estimation iterations.

Conclusion: MCI-Net effectively addresses limitations of Euclidean neighborhood-based approaches by integrating multi-domain contextual cues, leading to superior point cloud registration performance through improved feature representation and robust inlier selection.

Abstract: Robust and discriminative feature learning is critical for high-quality point cloud registration. However, existing deep learning-based methods typically rely on Euclidean neighborhood-based strategies for feature extraction, which struggle to effectively capture the implicit semantics and structural consistency in point clouds. To address these issues, we propose a multi-domain context integration network (MCI-Net) that improves feature representation and registration performance by aggregating contextual cues from diverse domains. Specifically, we propose a graph neighborhood aggregation module, which constructs a global graph to capture the overall structural relationships within point clouds. We then propose a progressive context interaction module to enhance feature discriminability by performing intra-domain feature decoupling and inter-domain context interaction. Finally, we design a dynamic inlier selection method that optimizes inlier weights using residual information from multiple iterations of pose estimation, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of registration. Extensive experiments on indoor RGB-D and outdoor LiDAR datasets show that the proposed MCI-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving the highest registration recall of 96.4\% on 3DMatch.

Motivation: Existing CNN backbones for two-view correspondence learning are not tailored to specific tasks, leading to ineffective global context aggregation and oversmoothing of dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity.

Method: SC-Net integrates bilateral context through three modules: 1) Adaptive Focused Regularization (AFR) for position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion, 2) Bilateral Field Adjustment (BFA) for refining motion fields by modeling long-range relationships across spatial/channel dimensions, and 3) Position-Aware Recovery (PAR) for consistent and precise motion vector recovery.

Result: SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SC-Net effectively addresses limitations of existing CNN backbones by integrating bilateral context, leading to superior performance in two-view correspondence learning tasks.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbones in two-view correspondence learning, demonstrating significant superiority over methods based on multilayer perceptrons. However, CNN backbones that are not tailored to specific tasks may fail to effectively aggregate global context and oversmooth dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity. To address these problems, we propose a novel network named SC-Net, which effectively integrates bilateral context from both spatial and channel perspectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive focused regularization module (AFR) to enhance the model's position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion samples, thereby facilitating the generation of a more accurate motion field. We then propose a bilateral field adjustment module (BFA) to refine the motion field by simultaneously modeling long-range relationships and facilitating interaction across spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, we recover the motion vectors from the refined field using a position-aware recovery module (PAR) that ensures consistency and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TV-RAG is a training-free architecture that improves long-video reasoning for Large Video Language Models by combining temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics through time-decay retrieval and entropy-weighted key-frame sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Video Language Models struggle with long videos due to narrow temporal windows and inability to detect fine-grained semantic shifts over extended durations. Existing text-based retrieval pipelines ignore rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels.

Method: TV-RAG introduces two main mechanisms: 1) Time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into similarity computation to rank text queries by their true multimedia context, and 2) Entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames to reduce redundancy while preserving representativeness.

Result: The system consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks including Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: TV-RAG provides a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path for any LVLM without requiring re-training or fine-tuning, enabling dual-level temporal and semantic reasoning for long videos.

Abstract: Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current context modeling approaches focus too much on basic geometric relationships or localized features, neglecting important cross-scale contextual interactions between objects that are crucial for complex scene understanding.

Method: Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN) learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with attention mechanisms, cascades modules from different scales, selects salient anchors at finer scales, and dynamically fuses neighborhood features via attention in high-dimensional Hilbert space.

Result: PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations for multi-label classification.

Conclusion: The proposed PanCAN approach effectively addresses the limitation of neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions, substantially improving multi-label classification performance through hierarchical integration of multi-order geometric contexts and cross-scale feature aggregation.

Abstract: Context modeling is crucial for visual recognition, enabling highly discriminative image representations by integrating both intrinsic and extrinsic relationships between objects and labels in images. A limitation in current approaches is their focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, often neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects. This paper introduces the Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN), a novel approach that hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, PanCAN learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with an attention mechanism. Modules from different scales are cascaded, where salient anchors at a finer scale are selected and their neighborhood features are dynamically fused via attention. This enables effective cross-scale modeling that significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features. Extensive multi-label classification experiments on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, thereby substantially improving multi-label classification performance.

Result: IdentityStory outperforms existing methods on the ConsiStory-Human benchmark, particularly in face consistency, and supports multi-character combinations effectively.

Conclusion: The framework shows strong potential for applications like infinite-length story generation and dynamic character composition, advancing human-centric visual storytelling capabilities.

Abstract: Recent visual generative models enable story generation with consistent characters from text, but human-centric story generation faces additional challenges, such as maintaining detailed and diverse human face consistency and coordinating multiple characters across different images. This paper presents IdentityStory, a framework for human-centric story generation that ensures consistent character identity across multiple sequential images. By taming identity-preserving generators, the framework features two key components: Iterative Identity Discovery, which extracts cohesive character identities, and Re-denoising Identity Injection, which re-denoises images to inject identities while preserving desired context. Experiments on the ConsiStory-Human benchmark demonstrate that IdentityStory outperforms existing methods, particularly in face consistency, and supports multi-character combinations. The framework also shows strong potential for applications such as infinite-length story generation and dynamic character composition.

TL;DR: IAFS is a training-free framework that uses iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion to balance perceptual quality and structural fidelity in diffusion-based image super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based SR methods struggle to balance high-frequency perceptual quality and low-frequency structural fidelity. Current inference-time scaling approaches are suboptimal - reward-driven optimization causes perceptual over-smoothing while optimal-path search loses structural consistency.

Method: IAFS combines iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. It progressively refines generated images by correcting structural deviations iteratively, while adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information for effective frequency fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.

Conclusion: IAFS provides an effective training-free solution to balance perceptual quality and structural fidelity in diffusion-based image super-resolution through iterative refinement and adaptive frequency steering.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a leading paradigm for image super-resolution (SR), but existing methods struggle to guarantee both the high-frequency perceptual quality and the low-frequency structural fidelity of generated images. Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.

*Binhe Yu,Zhen Wang,Kexin Li,Yuqian Yuan,Wenqiao Zhang,Long Chen,Juncheng Li,Jun Xiao,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyMS is a training-free framework for multi-subject image customization that uses layout guidance and dual-level attention decoupling to balance text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-subject customization methods struggle to balance text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control, while requiring additional training that limits scalability and efficiency.

Method: AnyMS uses a training-free framework with three inputs (text prompt, subject images, layout constraints) and introduces bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling: global decoupling separates textual and visual attention for text alignment, and local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area to prevent conflicts and ensure layout control. It also uses pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features without additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments show AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supports complex compositions, and scales to larger numbers of subjects while maintaining the balance between text alignment, identity preservation, and layout control.

Conclusion: AnyMS presents an effective training-free solution for layout-guided multi-subject customization that successfully addresses the key challenges of balancing text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control while improving scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-subject customization aims to synthesize multiple user-specified subjects into a coherent image. To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints. However, existing methods still struggle to balance three critical objectives: text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control, while the reliance on additional training further limits their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to a larger number of subjects.

*Shengyi Hua,Jianfeng Wu,Tianle Shen,Kangzhe Hu,Zhongzhen Huang,Shujuan Ni,Zhihong Zhang,Yuan Li,Zhe Wang,Xiaofan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathFound is an agentic multimodal model that introduces evidence-seeking inference for pathological diagnosis, mimicking clinical workflows by refining hypotheses through repeated observations and targeted evidence acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathological foundation models use static inference where whole-slide images are processed once without reassessment, contrasting with clinical workflows that refine diagnoses through repeated observations and further examination requests.

Method: PathFound integrates pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement through three stages: initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision.

Result: The evidence-seeking strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy across several large multimodal models. PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle pathological details like nuclear features and local invasions.

Conclusion: Evidence-seeking workflows are effective in computational pathology, and PathFound represents a significant advancement by mimicking clinical diagnostic workflows through dynamic, iterative evidence acquisition rather than static inference.

Abstract: Recent pathological foundation models have substantially advanced visual representation learning and multimodal interaction. However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions.

### [231] [PurifyGen: A Risk-Discrimination and Semantic-Purification Model for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23546)
*Zongsheng Cao,Yangfan He,Anran Liu,Jun Xie,Feng Chen,Zepeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PurifyGen is a training-free, plug-and-play safety method for text-to-image diffusion models that purifies prompts by identifying risky tokens via semantic distance and transforming them through dual-space alignment to remove harmful content while preserving original intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety methods for text-to-image diffusion models have significant limitations: text blacklisting can be easily circumvented, and harmful content classification requires extensive datasets and extra training. There's a need for a more robust, training-free approach that maintains model weights while effectively preventing unsafe content generation.

Method: PurifyGen uses a dual-stage strategy: 1) Token safety evaluation via complementary semantic distance to measure proximity between prompt tokens and toxic/clean concept embeddings, enabling fine-grained classification without keyword matching. 2) For risky prompts, dual-space transformation projects toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of toxic concepts (removing harmful semantics) while aligning them into the range space of clean concepts (reinforcing safe semantics). A token-wise strategy selectively replaces only risky token embeddings.

Result: Extensive testing shows PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches. It offers strong generalization to unseen prompts and models while maintaining a plug-and-play, training-free solution.

Conclusion: PurifyGen provides an effective, theoretically-grounded solution for safe text-to-image generation that overcomes limitations of traditional safety methods. Its training-free nature, preservation of original model weights, and dual-space purification approach make it a practical and robust safety mechanism for diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have notably enhanced text-to-image (T2I) generation quality, but they also raise the risk of generating unsafe content. Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RxnBench is a multi-tiered benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs, revealing significant gaps in deep chemical logic and structural recognition despite strong text extraction capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MLLMs promise to revolutionize chemistry, their ability to understand the dense graphical language of chemical reactions in authentic scientific literature remains underexplored, creating a need for rigorous evaluation.

Method: Developed RxnBench with two tasks: Single-Figure QA (1,525 questions from 305 reaction schemes) testing visual perception and mechanistic reasoning, and Full-Document QA (108 articles) requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables.

Result: MLLMs show critical capability gaps - they excel at text extraction but struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Models with inference-time reasoning outperform standard architectures, but none achieve 50% accuracy on FD-QA.

Conclusion: There's an urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists, as current MLLMs lack the deep understanding required for complex chemical reaction comprehension.

Abstract: The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkGen is a think-driven visual generation framework that uses MLLM's Chain-of-Thought reasoning with a decoupled MLLM-DiT architecture and separable GRPO training for diverse generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While CoT reasoning has shown success in multimodal understanding tasks, its application to generation tasks remains limited by scenario-specific mechanisms that hinder generalization and adaptation.

Method: ThinkGen uses a decoupled architecture with a pretrained MLLM for generating tailored instructions based on user intent, and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for producing images guided by these instructions. It employs a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO) that alternates reinforcement learning between MLLM and DiT modules.

Result: Extensive experiments show ThinkGen achieves robust, state-of-the-art performance across multiple generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: ThinkGen successfully extends CoT reasoning to visual generation tasks through a flexible framework that enables joint training across diverse datasets and effective reasoning for various generative scenarios.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables systematic solutions to complex understanding tasks. However, its extension to generation tasks remains nascent and limited by scenario-specific mechanisms that hinder generalization and adaptation. In this work, we present ThinkGen, the first think-driven visual generation framework that explicitly leverages MLLM's CoT reasoning in various generation scenarios. ThinkGen employs a decoupled architecture comprising a pretrained MLLM and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), wherein the MLLM generates tailored instructions based on user intent, and DiT produces high-quality images guided by these instructions. We further propose a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO), alternating reinforcement learning between the MLLM and DiT modules. This flexible design enables joint training across diverse datasets, facilitating effective CoT reasoning for a wide range of generative scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkGen achieves robust, state-of-the-art performance across multiple generation benchmarks. Code is available: https://github.com/jiaosiyuu/ThinkGen

TL;DR: Haar-tSVD: A fast, one-step denoising method combining tensor SVD with Haar transform for efficient noise removal without learning local bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the growing need for efficient and effective image denoising due to the proliferation of imaging devices and massive daily image data generation. Current methods often face trade-offs between speed and performance.

Method: The method establishes a theoretical connection between PCA and Haar transform under circulant representation, then proposes Haar-tSVD which uses unified tensor SVD projection combined with Haar transform to capture global and local patch correlations. It's a one-step, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that doesn't require learning local bases. An adaptive noise estimation scheme improves robustness, and deep neural networks are integrated with Haar-tSVD for severe noise conditions.

Result: Experimental results on various denoising datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method for noise removal. The method achieves a good balance between denoising speed and performance.

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD provides an efficient and effective solution for image denoising that combines theoretical foundations with practical implementation, offering a fast, one-step approach that can be enhanced with deep learning for challenging noise conditions.

Abstract: The proliferation of imaging devices and countless image data generated every day impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image denoising. In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation, and present a computationally simple denoising algorithm. The proposed method, termed Haar-tSVD, exploits a unified tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection combined with Haar transform to efficiently capture global and local patch correlations. Haar-tSVD operates as a one-step, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that eliminates the need for learning local bases, thereby striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Besides, an adaptive noise estimation scheme is introduced to improve robustness according to eigenvalue analysis of the circulant structure. To further enhance the performance under severe noise conditions, we integrate deep neural networks with Haar-tSVD based on the established Haar-PCA relationship. Experimental results on various denoising datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed method for noise removal.

*Shaohan Yu,Lijun Li,Chenyang Si,Lu Sheng,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProGuard is a vision-language proactive guard system that identifies and describes out-of-distribution safety risks in multimodal content without requiring model adjustments, outperforming existing methods on OOD risk detection and description.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods struggle with emerging multimodal safety risks and require model adjustments. Traditional reactive approaches are limited in handling out-of-distribution risks, creating a need for proactive safety solutions.

Method: 1) Constructed modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples with binary safety labels and hierarchical risk categories; 2) Trained vision-language base model using reinforcement learning; 3) Introduced OOD safety category inference task; 4) Augmented RL objective with synonym-bank-based similarity reward for concise description generation.

Result: ProGuard achieves comparable performance to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization, and improves OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.

Conclusion: ProGuard provides an effective proactive safety solution for multimodal content, demonstrating strong performance in identifying and describing unseen safety risks without requiring model adjustments, addressing limitations of traditional reactive approaches.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative models has led to a continuous emergence of multimodal safety risks, exposing the limitations of existing defense methods. To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time interactive video diffusion model via improved distillation that enables multimodal (text/image/audio) conditioned avatar generation with 20x faster inference and real-time latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for video generation are too slow for real-time interaction due to bidirectional attention and iterative denoising. Existing distillation methods focus on text-to-video and don't handle multimodal conditioning well, leading to unnatural human-AI interaction.

Method: Improved distillation recipe addressing challenges of Self Forcing approach, focusing on quality of condition inputs, initialization, and optimization schedule for on-policy distillation. Integrated with audio language models and Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks technique for long-form video inference.

Result: Distilled model matches visual quality of full-step bidirectional baselines with 20x less inference cost/latency. LiveTalk system outperforms Sora2 and Veo3 in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, reducing response latency from 1-2 minutes to real-time.

Conclusion: The proposed distillation approach enables real-time multimodal interactive video generation, bridging the gap for seamless human-AI interaction through the LiveTalk system.

Abstract: Real-time video generation via diffusion is essential for building general-purpose multimodal interactive AI systems. However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.

*Damiano Marsili,Aditya Mehta,Ryan Y. Lin,Georgia Gkioxari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TWIN introduces a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries to enhance fine-grained perceptual abilities of vision-language models, improving performance on fine-grained recognition tasks without compromising general VQA capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models are coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora focus too much on general recognition rather than fine-grained perception, limiting models' ability to distinguish visually similar objects.

Method: Created TWIN dataset with 561,000 image-pair queries where models must determine if two visually similar images show the same object, forcing attention to nuanced visual cues. Introduced FGVQA benchmark suite of 12,000 queries from multiple fine-grained domains. Fine-tuned VLMs on TWIN dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields up to 19.3% improvement on FGVQA benchmark across unseen domains (art, animals, plants, landmarks). Performance gains scale with dataset size. No compromise on general VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: TWIN dataset effectively enhances VLMs' fine-grained perceptual abilities. Scale is key to performance. TWIN can be easily integrated into existing VLM training pipelines to advance perceptual precision of future models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition ("Is it a cat or a dog?") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models. Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-stage detection model combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0 for improved night-time fire detection using infrared cameras, plus Patched-YOLO for RGB images, addressing false positives from artificial lights and small object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fire detection models using infrared night vision cameras suffer from limitations in dataset construction and frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire, despite decent performance metrics from models like YOLOv7, RT-DETR, and YOLOv9.

Method: Three main contributions: 1) Additional NIR dataset with data augmentation strategies; 2) Two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0 for night-time fire detection; 3) Patched-YOLO for RGB images using patch-based processing to enhance detection of small and distant objects.

Result: The proposed two-stage approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection, while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights. Patched-YOLO improves fire detection in RGB images for small and distant objects.

Conclusion: The paper presents effective solutions for improving fire detection accuracy in both infrared and RGB domains, addressing key challenges of data scarcity, false positives from artificial lights, and detection of small/distant fire objects.

Abstract: Improving the accuracy of fire detection using infrared night vision cameras remains a challenging task. Previous studies have reported strong performance with popular detection models. For example, YOLOv7 achieved an mAP50-95 of 0.51 using an input image size of 640 x 1280, RT-DETR reached an mAP50-95 of 0.65 with an image size of 640 x 640, and YOLOv9 obtained an mAP50-95 of 0.598 at the same resolution. Despite these results, limitations in dataset construction continue to cause issues, particularly the frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire.
  This report presents three main contributions: an additional NIR dataset, a two-stage detection model, and Patched-YOLO. First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0. The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection. Third, to improve fire detection in RGB images, especially for small and distant objects, we introduce Patched-YOLO, which enhances the model's detection capability through patch-based processing. Further details of these contributions are discussed in the following sections.

TL;DR: Proposed SRFA framework for early pancreatic tumor detection achieves 96.23% accuracy using multimodal CT data with hybrid ViT-EfficientNet classification and metaheuristic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early pancreatic tumor detection is challenging due to minimal contrast margins and large anatomical variations in CT scans, requiring systems that enhance subtle visual cues and generalize well across multimodal imaging data.

Method: SRFA framework with preprocessing, MAGRes-UNet segmentation, DenseNet-121 feature extraction, HHO-BA hybrid metaheuristic feature selection, hybrid ViT-EfficientNet-B3 classification, and SSA-GWO dual optimization for hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Achieved 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score, and 94.83% specificity, significantly outperforming traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models.

Conclusion: The SRFA framework demonstrates strong potential as an effective tool for early pancreatic tumor detection, addressing clinical challenges through integrated deep learning and optimization techniques.

Abstract: The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.

*Shu Pu,Boya Zeng,Kaichen Zhou,Mengyu Wang,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and analyzes how data and modeling choices affect memorization, finding that data modality, diversity, conditioning granularity, guidance scale, vector-set length, and rotation augmentation all influence memorization levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether 3D generative models memorize training data, which could lead to data leakage and reduced diversity in generated shapes, and to develop strategies to mitigate such memorization.

Method: The authors design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models, apply it to existing methods, and conduct controlled experiments using a latent vector-set diffusion model to study the effects of data and modeling factors.

Result: Memorization depends on data modality and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; modeling-wise, memorization peaks at moderate guidance scales and can be reduced with longer vector-sets and simple rotation augmentation without degrading generation quality.

Conclusion: The framework provides empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggests effective strategies to reduce memorization while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used in 3D vision to synthesize novel shapes, yet it remains unclear whether their generation relies on memorizing training shapes. Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the influence of different data and modeling designs on memorization. We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

TL;DR: HAT is a spatio-temporal alignment module for autonomous driving perception that adaptively selects optimal alignment proposals from multiple motion hypotheses without supervision, improving 3D temporal detection and tracking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spatio-temporal alignment in autonomous driving perception rely on attention mechanisms with simplified motion models (like constant velocity), which are suboptimal due to variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames.

Method: HAT uses multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances, then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues from cached object queries to select the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame.

Result: HAT achieves state-of-the-art tracking with 46.0% AMOTA on nuScenes test set with DETR3D, improves perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces collision rate by 32% in end-to-end AD, and enables robust perception under semantic corruption (nuScenes-C).

Conclusion: HAT demonstrates that adaptive multi-hypothesis alignment with explicit motion modeling significantly improves temporal perception in autonomous driving, particularly enhancing robustness when semantic features are unreliable.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.

### [242] [OmniAgent: Audio-Guided Active Perception Agent for Omnimodal Audio-Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23646)
*Keda Tao,Wenjie Du,Bohan Yu,Weiqiang Wang,Jian Liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniAgent is an audio-guided active perception agent that uses dynamic tool orchestration for fine-grained audio-visual reasoning, achieving 10-20% accuracy improvements over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current omnimodal LLMs lack fine-grained cross-modal understanding and struggle with multimodal alignment. They rely on rigid workflows and dense frame-captioning rather than active perception.

Method: OmniAgent uses dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate specialized tools on demand. It employs a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm where audio cues localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three audio-video understanding benchmarks, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by 10-20% accuracy margins.

Conclusion: Represents a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry, demonstrating that dynamic tool orchestration guided by audio cues enables superior fine-grained audio-visual reasoning.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models have made significant strides in unifying audio and visual modalities; however, they often lack the fine-grained cross-modal understanding and have difficulty with multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.

*Kang Du,Yirui Guan,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDT is a transformer-based feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition that produces view-consistent diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading in a single forward pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects, making intrinsic decomposition fundamental for visual understanding. While recent diffusion-based methods work for single-view decomposition, they struggle with view inconsistency in multi-view settings.

Method: IDT uses transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, adopting a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into three components: diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, better-isolated specular components, and substantially improved multi-view consistency compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: IDT provides an effective feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic decomposition that produces interpretable, controllable, and view-consistent results without iterative generative sampling.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition is fundamental for visual understanding, as RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects. Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.

*Shaocong Xu,Songlin Wei,Qizhe Wei,Zheng Geng,Hong Li,Licheng Shen,Qianpu Sun,Shu Han,Bin Ma,Bohan Li,Chongjie Ye,Yuhang Zheng,Nan Wang,Saining Zhang,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransPhy3D: A synthetic video dataset and DKT model that repurposes video diffusion priors for temporally consistent depth/normal estimation on transparent/reflective objects, achieving SOTA results on real/synthetic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transparent and reflective objects are challenging for perception systems due to refraction, reflection, and transmission breaking assumptions of traditional depth estimation methods, causing holes and temporal instability.

Method: 1) Create TransPhy3D synthetic corpus (11k sequences) with physically-based ray tracing; 2) Adapt large video diffusion model via LoRA adapters to learn RGB-to-depth translation; 3) Co-train on TransPhy3D and existing datasets; 4) Use concatenated RGB+noisy depth latents in DiT backbone for temporal consistency.

Result: DKT achieves zero-shot SOTA on real/synthetic benchmarks (ClearPose, DREDS, TransPhy3D-Test), improves accuracy and temporal consistency over baselines, boosts robotic grasping success rates across various surfaces, and runs at ~0.17 s/frame for 1.3B version.

Conclusion: Video diffusion models internalize optical rules for transparency, enabling efficient repurposing into robust, temporally coherent perception systems for challenging real-world manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Transparent objects remain notoriously hard for perception systems: refraction, reflection and transmission break the assumptions behind stereo, ToF and purely discriminative monocular depth, causing holes and temporally unstable estimates. Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: "Diffusion knows transparency." Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.

TL;DR: Stream-DiffVSR is a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online video super-resolution that processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds, making it the first diffusion-based VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based VSR methods achieve good perceptual quality but are impractical for latency-sensitive applications due to their reliance on future frames and expensive multi-step denoising processes.

Method: Combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) for enhanced detail and temporal coherence.

Result: Processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on RTX4090 GPU, significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods, boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) compared to online SOTA TMP while reducing latency by over 130x, and reduces initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds.

Conclusion: Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment by operating strictly on past frames with efficient causal conditioning.

TL;DR: A method for efficiently deploying distributed DNNs on edge devices through structured pruning and multi-objective optimization, demonstrated on MVCNN for 3D object recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are essential for computer vision but difficult to deploy on resource-constrained edge devices due to high parameter counts and computational demands.

Method: Integrates structured model pruning with multi-objective optimization to tailor network capacity to heterogeneous device constraints. Specifically quantifies individual view contributions in MVCNN and allocates pruning budgets accordingly.

Result: Resulting models satisfy user-specified accuracy and memory bounds while reducing inference latency by 1.2x to 5.0x across diverse hardware platforms.

Conclusion: Performance-aware, view-adaptive compression provides a viable pathway for deploying complex vision models in distributed edge environments.

Abstract: Deep distributed networks (DNNs) have become central to modern computer vision, yet their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains hindered by substantial parameter counts and computational demands. Here, we present an approach to the efficient deployment of distributed DNNs that jointly respects hardware limitations and preserves task performance. Our method integrates a structured model pruning with a multi-objective optimization to tailor network capacity to heterogeneous device constraints. We demonstrate this framework using Multi-View Convolutional Neural Network (MVCNN), a state-of-the-art architecture for 3D object recognition, by quantifying the contribution of individual views to classification accuracy and allocating pruning budgets, respectively. Experimental results show that the resulting models satisfy user-specified bounds on accuracy and memory footprint while reducing inference latency by factors ranging from 1.2x to 5.0x across diverse hardware platforms. These findings suggest that performance-aware, view-adaptive compression provides a viable pathway for deploying complex vision models in distributed edge environments.

*Alexandru Hegyi*

TL;DR: A semi-automatic workflow using GeoSAM for rapid glacier delineation from Sentinel-2 imagery, demonstrated in Svalbard with good results for major glaciers but some errors with small features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing glacier boundary delineation approaches are difficult to scale across long time series and heterogeneous environments, creating a need for more efficient and consistent methods.

Method: Combines late-summer image compositing, spectral-index-based ice area identification, prompt-guided segmentation using GeoSAM, and physically based post-processing to derive annual glacier outlines.

Result: Produces spatially coherent and temporally consistent outlines for major glacier bodies in Ny-Alesund and Kongsfjorden region, with most errors associated with small features affected by water bodies, terrain shadows, or high surface variability.

Conclusion: The workflow provides a fast and practical alternative for multi-temporal glacier mapping and ice-loss assessment, with flexibility for other optical datasets and improved performance expected at higher spatial resolution, though user inspection remains necessary.

Abstract: Consistent glacier boundary delineation is essential for monitoring glacier change, yet many existing approaches are difficult to scale across long time series and heterogeneous environments. In this report, we present a GeoSAM-based, semi-automatic workflow for rapid glacier delineation from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance imagery. The method combines late-summer image compositing, spectral-index-based identification of candidate ice areas, prompt-guided segmentation using GeoSAM, and physically based post-processing to derive annual glacier outlines. The workflow is demonstrated in the Ny-Alesund and Kongsfjorden region of western Svalbard across multiple years of the Sentinel-2 era. Results show that the approach produces spatially coherent and temporally consistent outlines for major glacier bodies, while most errors are associated with small features affected by water bodies, terrain shadows, or high surface variability. The reliance on derived RGB imagery makes the method flexible and transferable to other optical datasets, with improved performance expected at higher spatial resolution. Although user inspection remains necessary to filter incorrect polygons and adjust thresholds for local conditions, the workflow provides a fast and practical alternative for multi-temporal glacier mapping and ice-loss assessment.

### [248] [Field strength-dependent performance variability in deep learning-based analysis of magnetic resonance imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22176)
*Muhammad Ibtsaam Qadir,Duane Schonlau,Ulrike Dydak,Fiona R. Kolbinger*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MRI scanner field strength (1.5T vs 3.0T) significantly affects deep learning segmentation performance, especially for soft tissues like breast tumors and pancreas, with 3.0T-trained models generally outperforming 1.5T-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantitatively evaluate how MRI scanner magnetic field strength impacts the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation algorithms, as field strength is a potential confounding factor in AI studies.

Method: Used three public MRI datasets (breast tumor, pancreas, cervical spine) stratified by field strength. Developed three nnU-Net models per task: trained on 1.5T only, 3.0T only, and combined data. Evaluated each model on both field strengths. Analyzed field-strength differences via UMAP clustering and radiomic analysis (23 features).

Result: For breast tumor segmentation, 3.0T-trained model significantly outperformed others on both validation sets (DSC: 0.494 vs 0.411/0.373 on 1.5T, 0.433 vs 0.289/0.268 on 3.0T). Pancreas showed similar trends. Cervical spine models performed well on same-field data with minimal cross-field degradation. Radiomic analysis showed moderate field-strength clustering in soft tissues but minimal in osseous structures.

Conclusion: Magnetic field strength in training data substantially influences deep learning segmentation performance, particularly for soft-tissue structures. Field strength should be considered as a confounding factor in AI studies evaluating MRI performance.

Abstract: This study quantitatively evaluates the impact of MRI scanner magnetic field strength on the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation algorithms. Three publicly available MRI datasets (breast tumor, pancreas, and cervical spine) were stratified by scanner field strength (1.5T vs. 3.0T). For each segmentation task, three nnU-Net-based models were developed: A model trained on 1.5T data only (m-1.5T), a model trained on 3.0T data only (m-3.0T), and a model trained on pooled 1.5T and 3.0T data (m-combined). Each model was evaluated on both 1.5T and 3.0T validation sets. Field-strength-dependent performance differences were investigated via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)-based clustering and radiomic analysis, including 23 first-order and texture features. For breast tumor segmentation, m-3.0T (DSC: 0.494 [1.5T] and 0.433 [3.0T]) significantly outperformed m-1.5T (DSC: 0.411 [1.5T] and 0.289 [3.0T]) and m-combined (DSC: 0.373 [1.5T] and 0.268[3.0T]) on both validation sets (p<0.0001). Pancreas segmentation showed similar trends: m-3.0T achieved the highest DSC (0.774 [1.5T], 0.840 [3.0T]), while m-1.5T underperformed significantly (p<0.0001). For cervical spine, models performed optimally on same-field validation sets with minimal cross-field performance degradation (DSC>0.92 for all comparisons). Radiomic analysis revealed moderate field-strength-dependent clustering in soft tissues (silhouette scores 0.23-0.29) but minimal separation in osseous structures (0.12). These results indicate that magnetic field strength in the training data substantially influences the performance of deep learning-based segmentation models, particularly for soft-tissue structures (e.g., small lesions). This warrants consideration of magnetic field strength as a confounding factor in studies evaluating AI performance on MRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in brain tumor diagnosis in low-resource environments where expert neuroradiology, high-end MRI, and invasive biopsies are limited, and overcome constraints of existing deep learning approaches including computational demands, dataset shift, and limited interpretability.

Method: Two-branch approach: 1) MobileNetV2-based CNN for classification, 2) radiomics branch extracting 8 handcrafted features (shape, intensity statistics, GLCM texture). Late fusion concatenates CNN embeddings with radiomics features, followed by RandomForest classifier. Explainability via Grad-CAM and feature importance analysis.

Result: Improved validation performance for fusion approach compared to single-branch baselines. Robustness tests under reduced resolution and additive noise reveal sensitivity relevant to low-resource imaging conditions.

Conclusion: The prototype virtual biopsy pipeline demonstrates potential for brain tumor classification in resource-limited settings, providing decision support with improved performance and interpretability, but is framed as complementary to clinical diagnosis rather than a replacement for histopathology.

Abstract: Timely brain tumor diagnosis remains challenging in low-resource clinical environments where expert neuroradiology interpretation, high-end MRI hardware, and invasive biopsy procedures may be limited. Although deep learning has achieved strong performance in brain tumor analysis, real-world adoption is constrained by computational demands, dataset shift across scanners, and limited interpretability. This paper presents a prototype virtual biopsy pipeline for four-class classification of 2D brain MRI images using a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) and complementary radiomics-style handcrafted features. A MobileNetV2-based CNN is trained for classification, while an interpretable radiomics branch extracts eight features capturing lesion shape, intensity statistics, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture descriptors. A late fusion strategy concatenates CNN embeddings with radiomics features and trains a RandomForest classifier on the fused representation. Explainability is provided via Grad-CAM visualizations and radiomics feature importance analysis. Experiments on a public Kaggle brain tumor MRI dataset show improved validation performance for fusion relative to single-branch baselines, while robustness tests under reduced resolution and additive noise highlight sensitivity relevant to low-resource imaging conditions. The system is framed as decision support and not a substitute for clinical diagnosis or histopathology.

Motivation: Full-resolution SMWI acquisition for Parkinson's disease diagnosis requires long scan times, creating a need for efficient reconstruction methods that can generate high-quality SMWI from reduced k-space data while preserving diagnostic relevance.

Method: Proposes a complex-valued Swin Transformer based network for super-resolution reconstruction of multi-echo MRI data. The method reconstructs high-quality SMWI images from low-resolution k-space inputs.

Conclusion: The approach enables shorter scan times without compromising diagnostic detail, potentially improving clinical applicability of SMWI for Parkinson's disease and supporting faster, more efficient neuroimaging workflows.

Abstract: Susceptibility Map Weighted Imaging (SMWI) is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique used to detect nigral hyperintensity in Parkinsons disease. However, full resolution SMWI acquisition is limited by long scan times. Efficient reconstruction methods are therefore required to generate high quality SMWI from reduced k space data while preserving diagnostic relevance. In this work, we propose a complex valued Swin Transformer based network for super resolution reconstruction of multi echo MRI data. The proposed method reconstructs high quality SMWI images from low resolution k space inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves a structural similarity index of 0.9116 and a mean squared error of 0.076 when reconstructing SMWI from 256 by 256 k space data, while maintaining critical diagnostic features. This approach enables high quality SMWI reconstruction from reduced k space sampling, leading to shorter scan times without compromising diagnostic detail. The proposed method has the potential to improve the clinical applicability of SMWI for Parkinsons disease and support faster and more efficient neuroimaging workflows.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Diffusion-based super-resolution framework (SR3) enhances low-resolution capsule endoscopy images, outperforming traditional methods with better anatomical fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capsule endoscopy has low image resolution due to hardware/power/transmission constraints, limiting identification of fine mucosal textures and subtle pathologies needed for early diagnosis.

Method: Adopts SR3 framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to learn probabilistic mapping from low to high resolution. Uses HyperKvasir dataset for training/evaluation, with architectural enhancements including attention mechanisms.

Result: Significantly outperforms bicubic interpolation and GAN-based methods (ESRGAN): baseline achieves PSNR 27.5 dB/SSIM 0.65, enhanced version reaches 29.3 dB/0.71. Shows improved preservation of anatomical boundaries, vascular patterns, and lesion structures.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based super-resolution is promising for enhancing non-invasive medical imaging, especially in capsule endoscopy where resolution is fundamentally constrained, offering stable training and better structural fidelity than GANs.

Abstract: Capsule endoscopy has enabled minimally invasive gastrointestinal imaging, but its clinical utility is limited by the inherently low resolution of captured images due to hardware, power, and transmission constraints. This limitation hampers the identification of fine-grained mucosal textures and subtle pathological features essential for early diagnosis.
  This work investigates a diffusion-based super-resolution framework to enhance capsule endoscopy images in a data-driven and anatomically consistent manner. We adopt the SR3 (Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement) framework built upon Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to learn a probabilistic mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution images. Unlike GAN-based approaches that often suffer from training instability and hallucination artifacts, diffusion models provide stable likelihood-based training and improved structural fidelity. The HyperKvasir dataset, a large-scale publicly available gastrointestinal endoscopy dataset, is used for training and evaluation.
  Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms bicubic interpolation and GAN-based super-resolution methods such as ESRGAN, achieving PSNR of 27.5 dB and SSIM of 0.65 for a baseline model, and improving to 29.3 dB and 0.71 with architectural enhancements including attention mechanisms. Qualitative results show improved preservation of anatomical boundaries, vascular patterns, and lesion structures. These findings indicate that diffusion-based super-resolution is a promising approach for enhancing non-invasive medical imaging, particularly in capsule endoscopy where image resolution is fundamentally constrained.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MEGA-PCC is an end-to-end learning-based framework for joint compression of point cloud geometry and attributes using a shared encoder, dual decoders, and a Mamba-based entropy model, eliminating manual bitrate tuning and recoloring procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud compression methods rely on post-hoc recoloring procedures and manually tuned bitrate allocation between geometry and attributes, which hinders end-to-end optimization and increases system complexity.

Method: Proposes MEGA-PCC with two specialized models: 1) Main compression model with shared encoder for unified latent representation and dual decoders for sequential geometry/attribute reconstruction, and 2) Mamba-based Entropy Model (MEM) for enhanced probability estimation by capturing spatial and channel-wise correlations. Both use Mamba architecture for long-range dependency modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments show MEGA-PCC achieves superior rate-distortion performance and runtime efficiency compared to both traditional and learning-based baselines.

Conclusion: MEGA-PCC offers a powerful AI-driven solution for point cloud compression by enabling data-driven bitrate allocation during training and simplifying the overall pipeline through end-to-end optimization.

Abstract: Joint compression of point cloud geometry and attributes is essential for efficient 3D data representation. Existing methods often rely on post-hoc recoloring procedures and manually tuned bitrate allocation between geometry and attribute bitstreams in inference, which hinders end-to-end optimization and increases system complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose MEGA-PCC, a fully end-to-end, learning-based framework featuring two specialized models for joint compression. The main compression model employs a shared encoder that encodes both geometry and attribute information into a unified latent representation, followed by dual decoders that sequentially reconstruct geometry and then attributes. Complementing this, the Mamba-based Entropy Model (MEM) enhances entropy coding by capturing spatial and channel-wise correlations to improve probability estimation. Both models are built on the Mamba architecture to effectively model long-range dependencies and rich contextual features. By eliminating the need for recoloring and heuristic bitrate tuning, MEGA-PCC enables data-driven bitrate allocation during training and simplifies the overall pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEGA-PCC achieves superior rate-distortion performance and runtime efficiency compared to both traditional and learning-based baselines, offering a powerful solution for AI-driven point cloud compression.

Method: Uses semantic feature contrastive learning loss that evaluates semantic similarity in high-level latent spaces and anatomical similarity in shallow spaces, with a three-stage U-Net architecture for coarse reconstruction, detail refinement, and semantic measurement.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction quality and faster processing on chest dataset with orthogonal projections compared to other algorithms, with significant image quality improvements.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical solution for orthogonal CT reconstruction with improved quality and low computational complexity.

Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is widely used in medical imaging, with sparse-view reconstruction offering an effective way to reduce radiation dose. However, ill-posed conditions often result in severe streak artifacts. Recent advances in deep learning-based methods have improved reconstruction quality, but challenges still remain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel semantic feature contrastive learning loss function that evaluates semantic similarity in high-level latent spaces and anatomical similarity in shallow latent spaces. Our approach utilizes a three-stage U-Net-based architecture: one for coarse reconstruction, one for detail refinement, and one for semantic similarity measurement. Tests on a chest dataset with orthogonal projections demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality and faster processing compared to other algorithms. The results show significant improvements in image quality while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a practical solution for orthogonal CT reconstruction.

*Minghao Dong,Xinyang Luo,Xujian Ouyang,Yongshun Xiao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SwinCCIR is an end-to-end deep learning framework using swin-transformer blocks and transposed convolutions to directly reconstruct Compton camera images from list-mode events, overcoming artifacts and systematic errors in conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compton cameras suffer from severe artifacts and deformation due to back-projection reconstruction, and systematic errors from device performance that degrade imaging quality. Existing iterative and deep-learning methods still rely on back-projection results.

Method: Proposed SwinCCIR, an end-to-end deep learning framework using swin-transformer blocks and a transposed convolution-based image generation module to directly establish the relationship between list-mode events and radioactive source distribution.

Result: SwinCCIR was trained and validated on both simulated and practical datasets, effectively overcoming problems of conventional Compton camera imaging and showing promise for practical applications.

Conclusion: The proposed SwinCCIR framework successfully addresses fundamental reconstruction issues in Compton cameras and is expected to be implemented in practical applications due to its effectiveness in overcoming conventional imaging problems.

Abstract: Compton cameras (CCs) are a kind of gamma cameras which are designed to determine the directions of incident gammas based on the Compton scatter. However, the reconstruction of CCs face problems of severe artifacts and deformation due to the fundamental reconstruction principle of back-projection of Compton cones. Besides, a part of systematic errors originated from the performance of devices are hard to remove through calibration, leading to deterioration of imaging quality. Iterative algorithms and deep-learning based methods have been widely used to improve reconstruction. But most of them are optimization based on the results of back-projection. Therefore, we proposed an end-to-end deep learning framework, SwinCCIR, for CC imaging. Through adopting swin-transformer blocks and a transposed convolution-based image generation module, we established the relationship between the list-mode events and the radioactive source distribution. SwinCCIR was trained and validated on both simulated and practical dataset. The experimental results indicate that SwinCCIR effectively overcomes problems of conventional CC imaging, which are expected to be implemented in practical applications.

*Qiang Sun,Zongcheng Ji,Yinlong Xiao,Peng Chang,Jun Yu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: EIR: Enhanced Image Representations for chest X-ray report generation using cross-modal transformers and medical domain pre-trained models to address information asymmetry and domain gap issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic medical report generation can reduce radiologists' workload and misdiagnosis risk, but existing methods have two key problems: 1) simple fusion of metadata and visual representations causes information asymmetry due to distinct distributions, and 2) using natural domain pre-trained models creates domain gap with medical images.

Method: Proposes Enhanced Image Representations (EIR) with two main components: 1) cross-modal transformers to fuse metadata representations (clinical history, retrieved reports) with image representations, addressing information asymmetry; 2) medical domain pre-trained models to encode chest X-ray images, bridging the domain gap.

Result: Experimental results on widely used MIMIC and Open-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for generating accurate chest X-ray reports.

Conclusion: EIR effectively addresses both information asymmetry in multimodal fusion and domain gap in image representation, improving automatic chest X-ray report generation performance.

Abstract: Generating medical reports from chest X-ray images is a critical and time-consuming task for radiologists, especially in emergencies. To alleviate the stress on radiologists and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, numerous research efforts have been dedicated to automatic medical report generation in recent years. Most recent studies have developed methods that represent images by utilizing various medical metadata, such as the clinical document history of the current patient and the medical graphs constructed from retrieved reports of other similar patients. However, all existing methods integrate additional metadata representations with visual representations through a simple "Add and LayerNorm" operation, which suffers from the information asymmetry problem due to the distinct distributions between them. In addition, chest X-ray images are usually represented using pre-trained models based on natural domain images, which exhibit an obvious domain gap between general and medical domain images. To this end, we propose a novel approach called Enhanced Image Representations (EIR) for generating accurate chest X-ray reports. We utilize cross-modal transformers to fuse metadata representations with image representations, thereby effectively addressing the information asymmetry problem between them, and we leverage medical domain pre-trained models to encode medical images, effectively bridging the domain gap for image representation. Experimental results on the widely used MIMIC and Open-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: JParc is a joint cortical registration and parcellation framework that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by combining accurate registration with learned parcellation atlas, achieving >90% Dice score using basic geometric features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based parcellation methods shift away from registration and atlas propagation without explaining why they outperform traditional methods. There's a need to understand the relationship between registration accuracy and parcellation performance.

Method: JParc is a joint framework that combines cortical registration and parcellation. It uses a shallow subnetwork to fine-tune propagated atlas labels, leveraging only basic geometric features (sulcal depth, curvature) that describe cortical folding patterns.

Result: JParc achieves Dice score greater than 90% on the Mindboggle dataset. The enhanced performance is primarily attributable to accurate cortical registration and a learned parcellation atlas.

Conclusion: JParc's superior accuracy can significantly increase statistical power in brain mapping studies and support applications in surgical planning and other downstream neuroscientific and clinical tasks.

Abstract: Cortical surface parcellation is a fundamental task in both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications, enabling more accurate mapping of brain regions. Model-based and learning-based approaches for automated parcellation alleviate the need for manual labeling. Despite the advancement in parcellation performance, learning-based methods shift away from registration and atlas propagation without exploring the reason for the improvement compared to traditional methods. In this study, we present JParc, a joint cortical registration and parcellation framework, that outperforms existing state-of-the-art parcellation methods. In rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that the enhanced performance of JParc is primarily attributable to accurate cortical registration and a learned parcellation atlas. By leveraging a shallow subnetwork to fine-tune the propagated atlas labels, JParc achieves a Dice score greater than 90% on the Mindboggle dataset, using only basic geometric features (sulcal depth, curvature) that describe cortical folding patterns. The superior accuracy of JParc can significantly increase the statistical power in brain mapping studies as well as support applications in surgical planning and many other downstream neuroscientific and clinical tasks.

*Frank Tian-Fang Ye,Xiaozi Gao*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: LLM analysis of 219K Chinese social media posts reveals platform differences in marriage sentiment and moral reasoning: Weibo is more positive, Xiaohongshu neutral; Autonomy and Community ethics correlate with negative attitudes, Divinity with neutral/positive ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand China's dramatic marriage decline (13.47M to 6.1M couples from 2013-2024) by examining not just emotional sentiment but also the moral reasoning underlying public attitudes toward marriage.

Method: Analyzed 219,358 marriage-related posts from Sina Weibo and Xiaohongshu using LLM-assisted content analysis. Coded posts for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral dimensions (Autonomy, Community, Divinity) based on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework.

Result: Platform differences: Weibo discourse skewed positive, Xiaohongshu predominantly neutral. Most posts lacked explicit moral framing. When moral ethics were invoked: Autonomy and Community ethics associated with negative sentiment; Divinity-framed posts tended toward neutral/positive sentiment.

Conclusion: Concerns about personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations drive negative marriage attitudes in China. LLMs are useful for scaling qualitative analysis. Findings offer insights for culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline.

Abstract: China's marriage registrations have declined dramatically, dropping from 13.47 million couples in 2013 to 6.1 million in 2024. Understanding public attitudes toward marriage requires examining not only emotional sentiment but also the moral reasoning underlying these evaluations. This study analyzed 219,358 marriage-related posts from two major Chinese social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Xiaohongshu) using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral dimensions (Autonomy, Community, Divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo discourse skewed positive, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts across both platforms lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral ethics were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged. Posts invoking Autonomy ethics and Community ethics were predominantly negative, whereas Divinity-framed posts tended toward neutral or positive sentiment. These findings suggest that concerns about both personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations drive negative marriage attitudes in contemporary China. The study demonstrates LLMs' utility for scaling qualitative analysis and offers insights for developing culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline in Chinese contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent2World: A tool-augmented multi-agent framework for generating and refining symbolic world models through multi-agent collaboration and interactive testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches for generating symbolic world models (like PDDL domains) lack large-scale verifiable supervision and rely on static validation methods that miss behavior-level errors during interactive execution.

Method: Three-stage multi-agent pipeline: 1) Deep Researcher agent performs web search to fill specification gaps, 2) Model Developer agent implements executable world models, 3) Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation with interactive feedback.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmarks for PDDL and executable code representations. Fine-tuned models show 30.95% average relative improvement over baseline models.

Conclusion: Agent2World provides both strong inference-time world-model generation and serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning through multi-agent feedback, addressing limitations of current static validation approaches.

Abstract: Symbolic world models (e.g., PDDL domains or executable simulators) are central to model-based planning, but training LLMs to generate such world models is limited by the lack of large-scale verifiable supervision. Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

TL;DR: MCE introduces a monadic framework for building robust AI agents using functional programming concepts like Functors, Applicatives, and Monads to handle state, errors, and concurrency systematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agent architectures use brittle, ad hoc patterns that struggle with state management, error handling, and concurrency, leading to unreliable systems.

Method: Proposes Monadic Context Engineering (MCE) using algebraic structures: Monads for sequential composition, Applicatives for parallel execution, and Monad Transformers for composing capabilities. Extends to Meta-Agents for generative orchestration.

Result: Enables construction of complex, resilient AI agents from simple, verifiable components with intrinsic handling of cross-cutting concerns like state propagation and error handling.

Conclusion: MCE provides a formal, principled foundation for agent design that addresses current architectural limitations through functional programming abstractions, enabling more robust and composable AI systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

*Danni Xu,Shaojing Fan,Xuanang Cheng,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RW-Post, a high-quality multimodal fact-checking dataset with annotated reasoning and evidence, and AgentFact, an agent-based framework that improves fact-checking accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fact-checking systems have limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization due to lack of dedicated datasets with complete real-world misinformation instances, annotated reasoning processes, and verifiable evidence.

Method: 1) Created RW-Post dataset by aligning real-world multimodal claims with original social media posts and extracting detailed reasoning/evidence from human fact-checking articles using LLM-assisted pipeline. 2) Developed AgentFact framework with five specialized agents for strategy planning, evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation, using iterative workflow alternating between evidence searching and task-aware filtering.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed RW-Post dataset and AgentFact framework address key limitations in multimodal fact-checking by providing comprehensive real-world data and an agent-based system that emulates human verification workflows, leading to more accurate and explainable misinformation detection.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation poses a growing challenge for automated fact-checking systems. Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents excel in digital domains but struggle with physical-world deployment because they lack robust spatial mental models. The paper aims to identify and evaluate three core cognitive challenges preventing this transition: spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking via mental simulation, and active exploration under partial observation.

Method: The authors introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. It uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities: from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. They also propose a diagnostic framework to isolate cognitive bottlenecks by providing external solver tools.

Result: Experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning. The benchmark successfully identifies specific cognitive bottlenecks in spatial reasoning and state tracking.

Conclusion: CubeBench provides key insights into LLM agents' limitations in physical-world deployment and offers a diagnostic framework to guide the development of more physically-grounded intelligent agents by isolating specific cognitive bottlenecks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, while proficient in the digital realm, face a significant gap in physical-world deployment due to the challenge of forming and maintaining a robust spatial mental model.

TL;DR: HiR is a sample-efficient RL framework for LLM alignment that replays failed attempts as successes based on satisfied constraints, enabling dual-preference learning with binary rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL for LLM alignment struggles because initial models often fail to generate responses satisfying all constraints, leading to sparse/indistinguishable rewards that impede learning.

Method: Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR) uses select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on constraints satisfied in hindsight, performing RL on both original and replayed samples with dual-preference learning at instruction- and response-level.

Result: Extensive experiments show HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks while requiring less computational budget.

Conclusion: HiR provides an effective sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks by leveraging hindsight replay and dual-preference learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions with various constraints. Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

TL;DR: Web World Model (WWM) bridges fixed web frameworks and fully generative world models by using web code for consistent world state/physics while LLMs generate context and decisions on top.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language agents need persistent worlds for action, memory, and learning. Current approaches are either too rigid (web frameworks with databases) or too uncontrollable (fully generative world models).

Method: WWM implements world state and "physics" in ordinary web code for logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on this structured latent state. Built on realistic web stack with design principles: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, using deterministic generation.

Result: Built suite of WWMs including infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic/narrative worlds, and simulation/game-like environments. Shows web stacks can serve as scalable substrate for world models.

Conclusion: Web World Models provide a middle ground enabling controllable yet open-ended environments for language agents, with web stacks serving as scalable substrate for world models.

Abstract: Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

TL;DR: M³ob: Multi-modal mobility prediction framework using LLM-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graphs for location recommendation, addressing generalization limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human mobility prediction methods have limited generalization capability - unimodal approaches suffer from data sparsity and biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to capture mobility dynamics due to semantic gaps between static multi-modal representations and spatial-temporal dynamics.

Method: 1) Construct unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) using LLM-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG) to capture functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge. 2) Design gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations across modalities. 3) Propose STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into static image modality.

Result: Extensive experiments on six public datasets show consistent improvements in normal scenarios and significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.

Conclusion: M³ob effectively leverages multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics, overcoming limitations of existing methods and demonstrating strong generalization capabilities for location recommendation tasks.

Abstract: The precise prediction of human mobility has produced significant socioeconomic impacts, such as location recommendations and evacuation suggestions. However, existing methods suffer from limited generalization capability: unimodal approaches are constrained by data sparsity and inherent biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to effectively capture mobility dynamics caused by the semantic gap between static multi-modal representation and spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, we leverage multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics for the location recommendation task, dubbed as \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Mob}ility (\textbf{M}$^3$\textbf{ob}). First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality. Extensive experiments on six public datasets show that our proposed method not only achieves consistent improvements in normal scenarios but also exhibits significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.

*Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for continual learning in LLM agents that uses episodic memory and reflection instead of backpropagation, enabling adaptation without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large language model agents to learn continually through interaction without requiring backpropagation or model fine-tuning, relaxing the separation between training and deployment phases.

Method: Introduces Stateful Reflective Decision Process that models reflective learning as a two-stage read-write interaction with episodic memory: writing stores outcomes (policy evaluation) and reading retrieves past cases (policy improvement). This induces an equivalent MDP over augmented state-memory representations.

Result: The framework is instantiated using entropy-regularized policy iteration with convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient state space coverage, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution.

Conclusion: Provides a principled foundation for memory-augmented, retrieval-based LLM agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates, using reflection as the key mechanism for learning through interaction.

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for continual and experiential learning in large language model agents that integrates episodic memory with reinforcement learning. The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates.

TL;DR: HiSciBench is a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating foundation models across five levels of scientific workflow, covering six disciplines with multimodal support, revealing significant performance gaps between basic literacy and discovery tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scientific AI benchmarks are fragmented and focus on narrow tasks, failing to capture the hierarchical, multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry and the complete scientific workflow.

Method: Created HiSciBench with 8,735 instances across 6 scientific disciplines, organized into 5 hierarchical levels: Scientific Literacy (L1), Literature Parsing (L2), Literature-based QA (L3), Literature Review Generation (L4), and Scientific Discovery (L5). Supports multimodal inputs (text, equations, figures, tables) and cross-lingual evaluation.

Result: Leading models show substantial performance gaps: up to 69% accuracy on basic literacy tasks (L1) but only 25% on discovery-level challenges (L5). Comprehensive evaluation of GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, and multimodal systems reveals hierarchical capability differences.

Conclusion: HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific intelligence, providing an integrated, dependency-aware framework for detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across scientific reasoning stages, offering actionable insights for developing more capable and reliable scientific AI models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models has sparked growing interest in their potential for scientific research. However, scientific intelligence encompasses a broad spectrum of abilities ranging from understanding fundamental knowledge to conducting creative discovery, and existing benchmarks remain fragmented. Most focus on narrow tasks and fail to reflect the hierarchical and multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. We introduce \textbf{HiSciBench}, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models across five levels that mirror the complete scientific workflow: \textit{Scientific Literacy} (L1), \textit{Literature Parsing} (L2), \textit{Literature-based Question Answering} (L3), \textit{Literature Review Generation} (L4), and \textit{Scientific Discovery} (L5). HiSciBench contains 8,735 carefully curated instances spanning six major scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and astronomy, and supports multimodal inputs including text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as cross-lingual evaluation. Unlike prior benchmarks that assess isolated abilities, HiSciBench provides an integrated, dependency-aware framework that enables detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations of leading models, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, and several multimodal systems, reveal substantial performance gaps: while models achieve up to 69\% accuracy on basic literacy tasks, performance declines sharply to 25\% on discovery-level challenges. HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific Intelligence and offers actionable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more reliable. The benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

### [269] [On the Existence and Behaviour of Secondary Attention Sinks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22213)
*Jeffrey T. H. Wong,Cheng Zhang,Louis Mahon,Wayne Luk,Anton Isopoussu,Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies and analyzes "secondary attention sinks" - tokens that receive disproportionate attention in middle layers of transformer models, differing from previously studied primary sinks (like BOS tokens) in their emergence patterns and properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While prior work identified attention sinks (like BOS tokens) that persist throughout networks, this paper discovers a fundamentally different class of sinks that emerge in middle layers with distinct properties, requiring systematic analysis to understand their formation, behavior, and impact on attention mechanisms.

Method: Conducted extensive experiments across 11 model families, analyzing where secondary sinks appear, their properties, formation mechanisms, and impact. Investigated the role of specific middle-layer MLP modules in creating these sinks and how vector norms determine sink behavior.

Result: Found that: (1) secondary sinks are formed by middle-layer MLPs mapping tokens to align with primary sink directions; (2) vector L2-norms determine sink scores and persistence duration; (3) primary sinks weaken in middle layers coinciding with secondary sink emergence; (4) larger models show more deterministic sink patterns with identifiable "sink levels" (3 in QwQ-32B, 6 in Qwen3-14B).

Conclusion: Secondary attention sinks represent a distinct phenomenon from primary sinks, emerging systematically in middle layers through specific MLP operations, with their properties determined by vector norms. These findings reveal more complex attention dynamics in transformers, especially in larger models where sink patterns become more structured and predictable.

Abstract: Attention sinks are tokens, often the beginning-of-sequence (BOS) token, that receive disproportionately high attention despite limited semantic relevance. In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B.

### [270] [Learning from Negative Examples: Why Warning-Framed Training Data Teaches What It Warns Against](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22293)
*Tsogt-Ochir Enkhbayar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Warning-framed content in training data fails to teach LLMs to avoid warned-against behavior; models reproduce flagged content at similar rates regardless of warnings due to overlapping latent features between "describing" and "performing" actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why language models fail to learn from warning-framed content in training data (e.g., "DO NOT USE - this code is vulnerable") and instead reproduce the warned-against behavior at similar rates as when given the content directly.

Method: Conducted experiments comparing models exposed to warning-framed content vs. direct content, used sparse autoencoder analysis to examine latent feature activation patterns, identified specific features (like Feature #8684 tracking code execution patterns), and investigated "stealth slip" phenomenon where conversational preambles rotate activations into subspaces missed by linear probes.

Result: Models reproduced flagged content at statistically indistinguishable rates (76.7% vs. 83.3%) regardless of warning framing. Sparse autoencoder analysis revealed overlapping latent feature activation between "describing X" and "performing X" contexts. Feature #8684 fired at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. Prompting and inference-time steering failed to fix the issue, while training-time feature ablation was effective.

Conclusion: Statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current LLM architectures. Models learn what tends to follow a context rather than understanding why content appears there. This reveals a fundamental limitation in how models process warning-framed content and suggests training-time feature interventions may be necessary rather than prompting-based solutions.

Abstract: Warning-framed content in training data (e.g., "DO NOT USE - this code is vulnerable") does not, it turns out, teach language models to avoid the warned-against behavior. In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: "describing X" and "performing X" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call "stealth slip", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely. Prompting and inference-time steering do not fix this; training-time feature ablation does. The upshot is that statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current architectures. Models learn what tends to follow a context, not why it appeared there.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AFA-LoRA introduces an annealed activation function to add non-linear expressivity to LoRA while maintaining mergeability, reducing the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's linear adaptation process limits its expressive power, creating a gap between linear and non-linear training. There's a need to enhance LoRA's capabilities while preserving its practical mergeability feature.

Method: Proposes AFA-LoRA with an annealed activation function that transitions from non-linear to linear transformation during training, allowing initial strong representational capabilities before converging to mergeable linear form.

Result: AFA-LoRA reduces performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training across supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding applications.

Conclusion: Enables more powerful and practical parameter-efficient adaptation by bringing non-linear expressivity to LoRA while maintaining seamless mergeability.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. However, its linear adaptation process limits its expressive power. This means there is a gap between the expressive power of linear training and non-linear training. To bridge this gap, we propose AFA-LoRA, a novel training strategy that brings non-linear expressivity to LoRA while maintaining its seamless mergeability. Our key innovation is an annealed activation function that transitions from a non-linear to a linear transformation during training, allowing the adapter to initially adopt stronger representational capabilities before converging to a mergeable linear form. We implement our method on supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding. The results show that AFA-LoRA reduces the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training. This work enables a more powerful and practical paradigm of parameter-efficient adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selective TTS: A process-based refinement framework that distributes compute across stages in multi-agent pipelines instead of repeated time-based refinement, using process-specific judges to prune low-quality branches early and stabilize refinement for tasks with unverifiable rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents can automate complex reasoning through Test-Time Scaling (TTS), but real-world multi-stage pipeline tasks often lack verifiable final rewards or sufficient data for robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulating errors across stages.

Method: Proposes Selective TTS framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipelines rather than repeated refinement over time. Uses process-specific judges to prune low-quality branches early, distributes compute across stages, and mitigates judge drift. Built an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating insightful charts and reports from datasets, with a reliable LLM-based judge model aligned with human experts.

Result: Selective TTS improves insight quality under fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance. The LLM-based judge model achieved alignment with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55).

Conclusion: Selective TTS represents a first step toward scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, such as scientific discovery and story generation, by stabilizing refinement through process-based distribution of compute and early pruning of low-quality branches.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can increasingly automate complex reasoning through Test-Time Scaling (TTS), iterative refinement guided by reward signals. However, many real-world tasks involve multi-stage pipeline whose final outcomes lack verifiable rewards or sufficient data to train robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulate error over stages. We propose Selective TTS, a process-based refinement framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipeline, instead of repeated refinement over time by prior work. By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance. We hope our findings serve as the first step toward to scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, such as scientific discovery and story generation.

### [273] [Debugging Tabular Log as Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22903)
*Chumeng Liang,Zhanyang Jin,Zahaib Akhtar,Mona Pereira,Haofei Yu,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphLogDebugger uses dynamic graphs to debug tabular logs more efficiently than LLM-based approaches, achieving better performance with simpler models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for processing text-enriched tabular log data rely too heavily on large language models and other heavy models, which limits flexibility and scalability for debugging real-world inconsistencies.

Method: Proposes GraphLogDebugger framework that constructs heterogeneous nodes for objects and events from tabular logs, connects them with edges to create an evolving dynamic graph, and uses a simple dynamic Graph Neural Network for debugging.

Result: The dynamic graph modeling enables a simple dynamic GNN to outperform LLMs in debugging tabular logs, validated by experimental results on real-world log datasets of computer systems and academic papers.

Conclusion: Dynamic graph modeling provides a more efficient and scalable approach for debugging tabular logs compared to LLM-heavy methods, with better performance using simpler models.

Abstract: Tabular log abstracts objects and events in the real-world system and reports their updates to reflect the change of the system, where one can detect real-world inconsistencies efficiently by debugging corresponding log entries. However, recent advances in processing text-enriched tabular log data overly depend on large language models (LLMs) and other heavy-load models, thus suffering from limited flexibility and scalability. This paper proposes a new framework, GraphLogDebugger, to debug tabular log based on dynamic graphs. By constructing heterogeneous nodes for objects and events and connecting node-wise edges, the framework recovers the system behind the tabular log as an evolving dynamic graph. With the help of our dynamic graph modeling, a simple dynamic Graph Neural Network (GNN) is representative enough to outperform LLMs in debugging tabular log, which is validated by experimental results on real-world log datasets of computer systems and academic papers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified LLM fine-tuning framework combining Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning through gradient decomposition into dense and sparse components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient and unified approach for LLM fine-tuning that leverages both imitation learning for token-level guidance and reinforcement learning for long-horizon reward optimization.

Method: Analyzes gradient of composite objective combining trajectory-level KL divergence with task rewards, decomposing into: 1) Dense Gradient for token-level imitation (analytically computable, closed-form logit-level formula), and 2) Sparse Gradient for long-horizon reward optimization (Monte Carlo estimated).

Result: The framework enables efficient GPU implementation through the closed-form dense gradient component while maintaining the ability to optimize for long-term rewards via the sparse gradient component.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework provides an efficient and theoretically grounded approach to LLM fine-tuning that combines the strengths of both imitation learning and reinforcement learning methodologies.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning that integrates Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning. By analyzing the gradient of a composite objective combining trajectory-level KL divergence with task rewards, we derive a natural decomposition into two components: (1) an analytically computable Dense Gradient for token-level imitation, and (2) a Monte Carlo estimated Sparse Gradient for long-horizon reward optimization. The Dense Gradient admits a closed-form logit-level formula, enabling efficient GPU implementation.

*Huan Song,Qingfei Zhao,Ting Long,Shuyu Tian,Hongjun An,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends neural scaling laws to familial models with early exits, introducing granularity (G) as a third scaling variable alongside model size (N) and tokens (D), showing minimal performance penalty for deployment flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural scaling laws only consider single dense models, overlooking the "familial models" paradigm needed for heterogeneous device-edge-cloud deployment. There's a need to understand how scaling laws apply to architectures with early exits that produce multiple deployable sub-models from one backbone.

Method: Proposes unified scaling law L(N, D, G) with granularity as third variable. Uses IsoFLOP experimental design to isolate architectural impact, systematically sweeps model sizes and granularities while adjusting tokens, decouples marginal cost of granularity from scale benefits.

Result: Granularity penalty follows multiplicative power law with extremely small exponent. Shows deployment flexibility can be achieved without compromising compute-optimality of dense baselines, validating "train once, deploy many" paradigm.

Conclusion: Successfully extends scaling laws to familial models, bridging fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Demonstrates theoretical foundation for practical deployment across heterogeneous hierarchies while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have become foundational for optimizing large language model (LLM) training, yet they typically assume a single dense model output. This limitation effectively overlooks "Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this "one-run, many-models" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the "train once, deploy many" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-model routing has become essential infrastructure, but lacks systematic, reproducible benchmarks for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). Existing work doesn't provide standardized evaluation protocols for VLM routing systems.

Method: Creates VL-RouterBench using raw inference/scoring logs from VLMs to construct quality and cost matrices over sample-model pairs. Covers 14 datasets across 3 task groups (30,540 samples), 15 open-source models + 2 API models (519,180 pairs). Evaluation protocol measures average accuracy, cost, throughput, and uses harmonic mean of normalized cost/accuracy for ranking.

Result: Evaluated 10 routing methods and baselines, showing significant routability gain. However, best current routers still have clear gap to ideal Oracle, indicating room for improvement through finer visual cues and textual structure modeling.

Conclusion: VL-RouterBench provides comprehensive benchmark for VLM routing evaluation. Will open-source data construction and evaluation toolchain to promote comparability, reproducibility, and practical deployment in multimodal routing research.

Abstract: Multi-model routing has evolved from an engineering technique into essential infrastructure, yet existing work lacks a systematic, reproducible benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). We present VL-RouterBench to assess the overall capability of VLM routing systems systematically. The benchmark is grounded in raw inference and scoring logs from VLMs and constructs quality and cost matrices over sample-model pairs. In scale, VL-RouterBench covers 14 datasets across 3 task groups, totaling 30,540 samples, and includes 15 open-source models and 2 API models, yielding 519,180 sample-model pairs and a total input-output token volume of 34,494,977. The evaluation protocol jointly measures average accuracy, average cost, and throughput, and builds a ranking score from the harmonic mean of normalized cost and accuracy to enable comparison across router configurations and cost budgets. On this benchmark, we evaluate 10 routing methods and baselines and observe a significant routability gain, while the best current routers still show a clear gap to the ideal Oracle, indicating considerable room for improvement in router architecture through finer visual cues and modeling of textual structure. We will open-source the complete data construction and evaluation toolchain to promote comparability, reproducibility, and practical deployment in multimodal routing research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to train language models for generating better research plans by extracting goals and rubrics from existing papers and using reinforcement learning with self-grading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements, limiting their effectiveness as AI co-scientists for human researchers.

Method: Automatically extract research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across domains, then train models via reinforcement learning with self-grading using a frozen copy of the initial policy as grader.

Result: Human experts preferred plans from finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model for 70% of research goals, approved 84% of extracted rubrics, and the approach showed 12-22% relative improvements with cross-domain generalization to medical research.

Conclusion: The scalable, automated training recipe demonstrates potential for improving general AI co-scientists, even in domains like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible.

Abstract: AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.

TL;DR: SoliReward is a systematic framework for training video reward models that addresses data quality, architectural design, and reward hacking issues through single-item binary annotations, cross-prompt pairing, hierarchical attention, and modified loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video reward models face three main challenges: noisy pairwise annotation data, underexplored VLM-based RM architectures, and susceptibility to reward hacking during post-training alignment.

Method: 1) Single-item binary annotations with cross-prompt pairing for high-quality data; 2) Hierarchical Progressive Query Attention for feature aggregation; 3) Modified Bradley-Terry loss accommodating win-tie scenarios to regularize score distributions.

Result: The framework shows improvements on benchmarks evaluating physical plausibility, subject deformity, and semantic alignment, with better RM evaluation metrics and enhanced post-training efficacy for video generation models.

Conclusion: SoliReward provides a comprehensive solution to video RM training challenges, offering systematic improvements in data collection, architecture design, and loss formulation for more effective post-training alignment of video generation models.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of video generation models with human preferences is a critical goal. Developing effective Reward Models (RMs) for this process faces significant methodological hurdles. Current data collection paradigms, reliant on in-prompt pairwise annotations, suffer from labeling noise. Concurrently, the architectural design of VLM-based RMs, particularly their output mechanisms, remains underexplored. Furthermore, RM is susceptible to reward hacking in post-training. To mitigate these limitations, we propose SoliReward, a systematic framework for video RM training. Our framework first sources high-quality, cost-efficient data via single-item binary annotations, then constructs preference pairs using a cross-prompt pairing strategy. Architecturally, we employ a Hierarchical Progressive Query Attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Finally, we introduce a modified BT loss that explicitly accommodates win-tie scenarios. This approach regularizes the RM's score distribution for positive samples, providing more nuanced preference signals to alleviate over-focus on a small number of top-scoring samples. Our approach is validated on benchmarks evaluating physical plausibility, subject deformity, and semantic alignment, demonstrating improvements in direct RM evaluation metrics and in the efficacy of post-training on video generation models. Code and benchmark will be publicly available.

TL;DR: Masters is a mask-progressive reinforcement learning framework for distilling knowledge from large vision-language teachers to compact student models by masking non-dominant teacher weights and using offline RL with accuracy and distillation rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs are impractical for mobile/edge deployment due to size, but distilling knowledge from large teachers to small students is challenging due to the size gap causing unstable learning and degraded performance.

Method: Mask-progressive RL distillation: 1) Mask non-dominant teacher weights to reduce complexity, 2) Progressively restore teacher capacity during training, 3) Offline RL stage with accuracy reward (response correctness) and distillation reward (transfer ease), using pre-generated responses from masked teachers.

Result: Enables students to learn richer representations smoothly and stably, achieving strong performance without expensive online think-answer processes, making compact VLMs more capable and efficient.

Conclusion: Masters provides an effective framework for knowledge distillation from large to small VLMs, addressing the size gap challenge through progressive masking and efficient offline RL rewards.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have recently achieved remarkable multimodal understanding, but their massive size makes them impractical for deployment on mobile or edge devices. This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process.

Method: Used JustEFAB framework to evaluate fairness of two deep learning models (Sybil and Venkadesh21) and one logistic regression model (PanCan2b) trained on NLST data, assessing AUROC, sensitivity, specificity across demographic subgroups while controlling for clinical confounders.

Result: Sybil showed significantly higher AUROC for women (0.88) vs men (0.81), and Venkadesh21 had lower sensitivity for Black (0.39) vs White (0.69) participants at 90% specificity. Differences persisted after controlling for clinical confounders.

Conclusion: AI lung cancer screening models exhibit demographic performance disparities that may constitute unfair biases, emphasizing the need for improved fairness monitoring and further research on algorithmic fairness in medical AI.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in adults worldwide. Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001). At 90% specificity, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.59) than White participants (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.73). These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB. Our findings highlight the importance of improving and monitoring model performance across underrepresented subgroups, and further research on algorithmic fairness, in lung cancer screening.

### [281] [Temporal Visual Semantics-Induced Human Motion Understanding with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22249)
*Zheng Xing,Weibing Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel unsupervised human motion segmentation method that integrates temporal vision semantics from LLM into subspace clustering, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subspace clustering methods for human motion segmentation overlook temporal semantic exploration. The authors aim to leverage temporal vision semantics derived from motion sequences using LLM's image-to-text capabilities to enhance subspace clustering performance.

Method: 1) Extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM to determine if frames depict the same motion. 2) Learn temporal neighboring information from LLM responses. 3) Develop TVS-integrated subspace clustering with temporal regularizer for similar subspace embeddings among temporal neighbors. 4) Implement segmentation with temporal constraint for grouping frames with neighbors. 5) Introduce feedback-enabled framework for continuous optimization of subspace embedding based on segmentation output.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating temporal vision semantics from LLM into subspace clustering.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal vision semantics extracted via LLM significantly improves human motion segmentation performance, showing that temporal semantic exploration is crucial for effective motion segmentation and that LLM's image-to-text capabilities can be effectively leveraged for this task.

Abstract: Unsupervised human motion segmentation (HMS) can be effectively achieved using subspace clustering techniques. However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Co-GRPO addresses the training-inference mismatch in Masked Diffusion Models by formulating generation as a unified MDP and jointly optimizing model and schedule parameters using trajectory-level reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a fundamental discrepancy between MDM training (single-step BERT-style objective) and inference (multi-step iterative process with schedule-dependent token decoding). This disconnect leaves inference schedules unoptimized during training, limiting generation quality.

Method: Reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process that jointly incorporates both model and inference schedule. Uses Group Relative Policy Optimization at trajectory level to cooperatively optimize model parameters and schedule parameters under shared reward, avoiding costly backpropagation through multi-step generation.

Result: Empirical results across four benchmarks (ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench) demonstrate substantial improvement in generation quality through more thorough alignment between training and inference.

Conclusion: Co-GRPO provides a holistic optimization approach that better aligns MDM training with inference by jointly optimizing both model and schedule parameters, leading to improved generation performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have shown promising potential across vision, language, and cross-modal generation. However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality. Empirical results across four benchmarks-ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench-demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: Language-aware multimodal approach effectively constrains precipitation nowcasting by incorporating textual motion descriptions, leading to significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, particularly for heavy rainfall events at extended lead times.

Abstract: Short-term precipitation nowcasting is an inherently uncertain and under-constrained spatiotemporal forecasting problem, especially for rapidly evolving and extreme weather events.

*Hassan Wasswa,Timothy Lynar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a scalable adaptive IoT threat detection framework that eliminates continuous classifier retraining by using latent-space alignment and graph neural networks to handle concept drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-based IoT threat detection models rely on stationary datasets that don't reflect dynamic real-world IoT NetFlow traffic affected by concept drift. Existing solutions require periodic retraining, causing high computational overhead and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Trains a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, uses an alignment model to map incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space, transforms representations into graph-structured format, and classifies using a graph neural network to capture inter-instance relationships.

Result: Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets demonstrate robust detection performance under concept drift, highlighting practical deployment potential in dynamic, large-scale IoT environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses concept drift challenges in IoT threat detection without continuous retraining, offering a scalable solution for practical deployment in dynamic IoT environments.

Abstract: Although AI-based models have achieved high accuracy in IoT threat detection, their deployment in enterprise environments is constrained by reliance on stationary datasets that fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world IoT NetFlow traffic, which is frequently affected by concept drift. Existing solutions typically rely on periodic classifier retraining, resulting in high computational overhead and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that eliminates the need for continuous classifier retraining. The proposed approach trains a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, while an alignment model maps incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space prior to classification, thereby preserving knowledge of previously observed attacks. To capture inter-instance relationships among attack samples, the low-dimensional latent representations are further transformed into a graph-structured format and classified using a graph neural network. Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains robust detection performance under concept drift. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical deployment in dynamic and large-scale IoT environments.

Motivation: To create a physics-driven alternative to conventional cross-entropy training and transformer attention that provides robust generalization, interpretable semantics, and emergent topology by leveraging quantum mechanics principles.

Method: Three tightly coupled components: 1) Time-independent wave-energy solver treating perception/classification as spectral decomposition under learned Hamiltonian; 2) Time-dependent dynamical solver governing semantic wavefunction evolution for context-aware decision revision; 3) Low-rank operator calculus learning symbolic transformations through quantum-like transition operators.

Conclusion: Suggests new foundational direction for ML where learning is cast as discovering and navigating underlying semantic energy landscape, offering physics-driven framework with interpretable semantics and robust generalization.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Schrödinger AI}, a unified machine learning framework inspired by quantum mechanics. The system is defined by three tightly coupled components: (1) a {time-independent wave-energy solver} that treats perception and classification as spectral decomposition under a learned Hamiltonian; (2) a {time-dependent dynamical solver} governing the evolution of semantic wavefunctions over time, enabling context-aware decision revision, re-routing, and reasoning under environmental changes; and (3) a {low-rank operator calculus} that learns symbolic transformations such as modular arithmetic through learned quantum-like transition operators. Together, these components form a coherent physics-driven alternative to conventional cross-entropy training and transformer attention, providing robust generalization, interpretable semantics, and emergent topology.
  Empirically, Schrödinger AI demonstrates: (a) emergent semantic manifolds that reflect human-conceived class relations without explicit supervision; (b) dynamic reasoning that adapts to changing environments, including maze navigation with real-time potential-field perturbations; and (c) exact operator generalization on modular arithmetic tasks, where the system learns group actions and composes them across sequences far beyond training length. These results suggest a new foundational direction for machine learning, where learning is cast as discovering and navigating an underlying semantic energy landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the slow sampling problem in diffusion models by creating more efficient models through distillation, but move beyond fixed reconstruction/consistency losses to a more flexible optimization approach.

Method: Treat distillation as a policy optimization problem where student is trained using reward signals derived from alignment with teacher outputs. Uses RL to dynamically guide student to explore multiple denoising paths and take longer, optimized steps toward high-probability regions.

Result: Achieves superior performance with significantly fewer inference steps and computational resources compared to existing distillation techniques. Framework is model-agnostic and applicable to any diffusion model with suitable reward functions.

Conclusion: Provides a general optimization paradigm for efficient diffusion learning through RL-based distillation, enabling faster sampling with maintained quality while being broadly applicable across diffusion model types.

Abstract: Distillation addresses the slow sampling problem in diffusion models by creating models with smaller size or fewer steps that approximate the behavior of high-step teachers. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based distillation framework for diffusion models. Instead of relying on fixed reconstruction or consistency losses, we treat the distillation process as a policy optimization problem, where the student is trained using a reward signal derived from alignment with the teacher's outputs. This RL driven approach dynamically guides the student to explore multiple denoising paths, allowing it to take longer, optimized steps toward high-probability regions of the data distribution, rather than relying on incremental refinements. Our framework utilizes the inherent ability of diffusion models to handle larger steps and effectively manage the generative process. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance with significantly fewer inference steps and computational resources compared to existing distillation techniques. Additionally, the framework is model agnostic, applicable to any type of diffusion models with suitable reward functions, providing a general optimization paradigm for efficient diffusion learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MFT (Mask Fine-Tuning) applied to VLMs outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by learning gating scores instead of updating weights, enabling structural reparameterization of existing knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning approaches for Vision-Language Models rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. The paper aims to explore more efficient adaptation by reorganizing internal subnetworks rather than modifying weights.

Method: Applies Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) to VLMs, specifically to language and projector components. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. This approach is grounded in structural reparameterization perspective.

Result: Experiments show MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. The method works with different language backbones and outperforms strong PEFT baselines.

Conclusion: Effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge. MFT provides a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for VLMs that leverages structural reparameterization of pre-trained representations.

Abstract: Explorations in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), have made impressive progress. However, most approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. Recent works have demonstrated that Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) can be a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for language models. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we rethink fine-tuning for VLMs from a structural reparameterization perspective grounded in MFT. We apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones and compare against strong PEFT baselines. Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. Our findings reveal that effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge.

TL;DR: CoLog is a multimodal log anomaly detection framework that uses collaborative transformers and multi-head attention to handle different log modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on point and collective anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unimodal methods ignore different log data modalities, while multimodal methods fail to properly handle interactions between these modalities. Logs contain various information types (modalities) that need collaborative analysis for effective anomaly detection.

Method: CoLog uses collaborative transformers with multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among log modalities. It incorporates a modality adaptation layer to handle heterogeneity from different log sources, enabling learning of nuanced patterns and dependencies.

Result: CoLog achieves mean precision of 99.63%, mean recall of 99.59%, and mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets. It outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and effectively detects both point and collective anomalies.

Conclusion: CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated unified framework for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. It addresses complex challenges in automatic log data analysis through multimodal collaborative learning.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection is crucial for preserving the security of operating systems. Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses. We also provide the implementation of CoLog at https://github.com/NasirzadehMoh/CoLog.

TL;DR: STAMP is a stochastic temporal autoencoder that enhances MAE with temporal awareness for medical imaging by modeling disease progression as a stochastic process conditioned on time differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning methods like MAE lack temporal awareness, which is crucial for capturing disease progression in longitudinal medical datasets. Deterministic approaches fail to account for inherent uncertainty in disease evolution.

Method: STAMP uses a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through stochastic processes by conditioning on time differences between input volumes. It reframes MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective to learn temporal dynamics stochastically.

Result: STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction tasks across OCT and MRI datasets.

Conclusion: STAMP successfully incorporates temporal awareness into self-supervised learning for medical imaging by modeling disease progression as a stochastic process, demonstrating superior performance on disease progression prediction tasks.

Abstract: Temporally aware image representations are crucial for capturing disease progression in 3D volumes of longitudinal medical datasets. However, recent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches like Masked Autoencoding (MAE), despite their strong representation learning capabilities, lack temporal awareness. In this paper, we propose STAMP (Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining), a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on the time difference between the 2 input volumes. Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient. STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed both existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on different late stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction which require models to learn the underlying non-deterministic temporal dynamics of the diseases.

In benchmarks against a commercial optical system, Mesquite achieves mean joint-angle error of 2-5 degrees while operating at approximately 5% of the cost. The system sustains 30 frames per second with end-to-end latency under 15ms and a packet delivery rate of at least 99.7% in standard indoor environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance art market valuation by incorporating visual content of artworks into predictive models, addressing limitations of traditional methods that rely primarily on artist identity and transaction history.

Method: Used large repeated-sales dataset from major auction houses; benchmarked classical hedonic regressions and tree-based methods against modern deep architectures, including multi-modal models that fuse tabular and image data.

Result: While artist identity and prior transaction history dominate overall predictive power, visual embeddings provide distinct and economically meaningful contribution for fresh-to-market works where historical anchors are absent. Interpretability analyses show models attend to compositional and stylistic cues.

Conclusion: Multi-modal deep learning delivers significant value precisely when valuation is hardest (first-time sales), offering new insights for both academic research and practice in art market valuation.

Abstract: We study how deep learning can improve valuation in the art market by incorporating the visual content of artworks into predictive models. Using a large repeated-sales dataset from major auction houses, we benchmark classical hedonic regressions and tree-based methods against modern deep architectures, including multi-modal models that fuse tabular and image data. We find that while artist identity and prior transaction history dominate overall predictive power, visual embeddings provide a distinct and economically meaningful contribution for fresh-to-market works where historical anchors are absent. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM and embedding visualizations show that models attend to compositional and stylistic cues. Our findings demonstrate that multi-modal deep learning delivers significant value precisely when valuation is hardest, namely first-time sales, and thus offers new insights for both academic research and practice in art market valuation.

TL;DR: VLA-Arena is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language-Action models with structured task design across three difficulty axes to systematically measure model limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLAs are advancing rapidly but lack quantitative understanding of their limits and failure modes. There's a need for systematic evaluation to identify critical limitations in these generalist robot policies.

Method: Introduces VLA-Arena with 170 tasks grouped into four dimensions (Safety, Distractor, Extrapolation, Long Horizon), each with three difficulty levels (L0-L2). Uses orthogonal language (W0-W4) and visual (V0-V4) perturbations for decoupled analysis. Fine-tuning only on L0 to assess generalization.

Result: Evaluation reveals critical VLA limitations: strong memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, lack of safety constraint consideration, and inability to compose skills for long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: VLA-Arena provides a systematic framework for benchmarking VLAs, identifying key challenges, and fostering research to address these limitations. The complete framework with datasets and evaluation tools is publicly available.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are rapidly advancing towards generalist robot policies, it remains difficult to quantitatively understand their limits and failure modes. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark called VLA-Arena. We propose a novel structured task design framework to quantify difficulty across three orthogonal axes: (1) Task Structure, (2) Language Command, and (3) Visual Observation. This allows us to systematically design tasks with fine-grained difficulty levels, enabling a precise measurement of model capability frontiers. For Task Structure, VLA-Arena's 170 tasks are grouped into four dimensions: Safety, Distractor, Extrapolation, and Long Horizon. Each task is designed with three difficulty levels (L0-L2), with fine-tuning performed exclusively on L0 to assess general capability. Orthogonal to this, language (W0-W4) and visual (V0-V4) perturbations can be applied to any task to enable a decoupled analysis of robustness. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLAs reveals several critical limitations, including a strong tendency toward memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, a lack of consideration for safety constraints, and an inability to compose learned skills for long-horizon tasks. To foster research addressing these challenges and ensure reproducibility, we provide the complete VLA-Arena framework, including an end-to-end toolchain from task definition to automated evaluation and the VLA-Arena-S/M/L datasets for fine-tuning. Our benchmark, data, models, and leaderboard are available at https://vla-arena.github.io.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in surgical robotics - lack of paired visual-kinematic datasets prevents VLA model training, while abundant surgical videos lack action labels.

Method: 1) Created SATA dataset with surgical action descriptions; 2) Built SurgWorld world model to generate realistic surgery videos; 3) Used inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic videos; 4) Trained surgical VLA policy on augmented synthetic data.

Result: Surgical VLA policy trained with augmented synthetic data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on real surgical robot platform.

Conclusion: Approach offers scalable path to autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging unlabeled surgical videos and generative world modeling, enabling generalizable and data-efficient surgical robot policies.

Abstract: Data scarcity remains a fundamental barrier to achieving fully autonomous surgical robots. While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform. Our approach offers a scalable path toward autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging the abundance of unlabeled surgical video and generative world modeling, thus opening the door to generalizable and data efficient surgical robot policies.

Result: Mixed performance on KITTI sequences 00-09 with notable improvements in specific cases: sequence 04 achieved 25.9% improvement in ATE RMSE and 30.4% improvement in ATE median, but effectiveness varied across different environmental conditions and scene types.

Conclusion: PCR-ORB demonstrates scenario-dependent effectiveness in dynamic environments, providing insights into dynamic object filtering challenges and opportunities for robust navigation, with potential for further optimization in complex real-world applications.

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) systems encounter substantial challenges in dynamic environments where moving objects compromise tracking accuracy and map consistency. This paper introduces PCR-ORB (Point Cloud Refinement ORB), an enhanced ORB-SLAM3 framework that integrates deep learning-based point cloud refinement to mitigate dynamic object interference. Our approach employs YOLOv8 for semantic segmentation combined with CUDA-accelerated processing to achieve real-time performance. The system implements a multi-stage filtering strategy encompassing ground plane estimation, sky region removal, edge filtering, and temporal consistency validation. Comprehensive evaluation on the KITTI dataset (sequences 00-09) demonstrates performance characteristics across different environmental conditions and scene types. Notable improvements are observed in specific sequences, with sequence 04 achieving 25.9% improvement in ATE RMSE and 30.4% improvement in ATE median. However, results show mixed performance across sequences, indicating scenario-dependent effectiveness. The implementation provides insights into dynamic object filtering challenges and opportunities for robust navigation in complex environments.

### [296] [RoboMirror: Understand Before You Imitate for Video to Humanoid Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23649)
*Zhe Li,Cheng Chi,Yangyang Wei,Boan Zhu,Tao Huang,Zhenguo Sun,Yibo Peng,Pengwei Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Fangzhou Liu,Chang Xu,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboMirror is a video-to-locomotion framework that uses vision-language models to understand visual motion intent from videos and directly generates physically plausible humanoid locomotion without pose reconstruction or retargeting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid locomotion systems rely on curated motion capture or sparse text commands, creating a gap between visual understanding and control. Text-to-motion methods have semantic sparsity issues, while video-based approaches only do mechanical pose mimicry without genuine visual understanding.

Method: RoboMirror uses vision-language models (VLMs) to distill raw egocentric/third-person videos into visual motion intents, which directly condition a diffusion-based policy to generate physically plausible, semantically aligned locomotion without explicit pose reconstruction or retargeting.

Result: RoboMirror enables telepresence via egocentric videos, reduces third-person control latency by 80%, and achieves 3.7% higher task success rate than baselines.

Conclusion: By reframing humanoid control around video understanding, RoboMirror bridges the gap between visual understanding and action, embodying the "understand before you imitate" principle.

Abstract: Humans learn locomotion through visual observation, interpreting visual content first before imitating actions. However, state-of-the-art humanoid locomotion systems rely on either curated motion capture trajectories or sparse text commands, leaving a critical gap between visual understanding and control. Text-to-motion methods suffer from semantic sparsity and staged pipeline errors, while video-based approaches only perform mechanical pose mimicry without genuine visual understanding. We propose RoboMirror, the first retargeting-free video-to-locomotion framework embodying "understand before you imitate". Leveraging VLMs, it distills raw egocentric/third-person videos into visual motion intents, which directly condition a diffusion-based policy to generate physically plausible, semantically aligned locomotion without explicit pose reconstruction or retargeting. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoboMirror, it enables telepresence via egocentric videos, drastically reduces third-person control latency by 80%, and achieves a 3.7% higher task success rate than baselines. By reframing humanoid control around video understanding, we bridge the visual understanding and action gap.
