### [1] [Modeling Open-World Cognition as On-Demand Synthesis of Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12547)
*Lionel Wong,Katherine M. Collins,Lance Ying,Cedegao E. Zhang,Adrian Weller,Tobias Gersternberg,Timothy O'Donnell,Alexander K. Lew,Jacob D. Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Tyler Brooke-Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Model Synthesis Architecture (MSA) that combines language models with probabilistic programs to enable human-like reasoning in novel situations by retrieving globally relevant information and constructing coherent mental models tailored to specific contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can effectively reason in novel situations by drawing relevant information from vast background knowledge and constructing coherent inferences. The challenge is understanding how people retrieve globally relevant information and reason over it coherently when faced with new scenarios.

Method: The authors develop a Model Synthesis Architecture (MSA) that uses language models for global relevance-based retrieval and model synthesis, combined with probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent world models. They test this on a "Model Olympics" dataset featuring sports vignettes that require reasoning about novel causal structures using background knowledge.

Result: The MSA approach outperformed language model-only baselines in capturing human judgments on the novel reasoning dataset. It successfully demonstrated the ability to perform open-ended reasoning that requires integrating novel causal structures with extensive background knowledge, even when faced with arbitrary novel variables.

Conclusion: The results suggest that MSAs can effectively mirror human reasoning capabilities by delivering locally coherent reasoning over globally relevant variables. This approach offers a promising path toward understanding and replicating human reasoning in open-ended domains by combining distributed and symbolic representations.

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

### [2] [Is This Just Fantasy? Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12553)
*Michael A. Lepori,Jennifer Hu,Ishita Dasgupta,Roma Patel,Thomas Serre,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies linear representations (modal difference vectors) in LMs that discriminate between modal categories, revealing better categorization abilities than previously thought. These vectors emerge consistently during training and correlate with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies questioned LMs' ability to categorize sentences by modality. This work aims to uncover reliable modal categorization in LMs and explore parallels with human behavior.

Method: The authors identify modal difference vectors in LMs and analyze their emergence during training. They correlate these vectors with human categorization behavior.

Result: LMs exhibit reliable modal categorization via modal difference vectors, which emerge predictably during training and align with human judgments.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights into LM modal categorization and suggest parallels with human cognition, advancing mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

vulnerable Chechen language and Russian, and the dataset collected to train and
evaluate it. We explore fine-tuning capabilities for including a new language
into a large language model system for multilingual translation NLLB-200. The

translation from Russian to Chechen and reverse direction, respectively. The
release of the translation models is accompanied by the distribution of
parallel words, phrases and sentences corpora and multilingual sentence encoder
adapted to the Chechen language.

### [4] [Improving Drug Identification in Overdose Death Surveillance using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12679)
*Arthur J. Funnell,Panayiotis Petousis,Fabrice Harel-Canada,Ruby Romero,Alex A. T. Bui,Adam Koncsol,Hritika Chaturvedi,Chelsea Shover,David Goodman-Meza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLP models, especially fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT, excel in classifying drug-related deaths from coroner reports, outperforming traditional methods and other NLP approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing rate of drug-related deaths, particularly due to fentanyl, necessitates accurate and timely surveillance, which is hindered by manual ICD-10 coding of free-text coroner reports.

Method: Multiple NLP approaches, including traditional classifiers and fine-tuned language models (BERT, BioClinicalBERT, Qwen 3, Llama 3), were evaluated on 35,433 death records (2020) and validated on 3,335 records (2023-2024). Performance was measured using macro F1 scores.

Result: Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT achieved near-perfect performance (macro F1 >=0.998) on internal tests and robust results (macro F1=0.966) in external validation, surpassing other methods.

Conclusion: NLP, particularly BioClinicalBERT, provides a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose surveillance, enabling faster detection of substance use trends compared to manual coding.

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

### [5] [AdaptiSent: Context-Aware Adaptive Attention for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12695)
*S M Rafiuddin,Sadia Kamal,Mohammed Rakib,Arunkumar Bagavathi,Atriya Sen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaptiSent is a novel framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from text and images, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sentiment and aspect-related information extraction by leveraging dynamic interactions between textual cues and visual context in multimodal data.

Method: Integrates dynamic modality weighting and context-adaptive attention mechanisms to focus on relevant inter-modal relationships.

Result: Outperforms baselines in precision, recall, and F1 score on Twitter datasets, excelling in nuanced inter-modal relationship identification.

Conclusion: AdaptiSent sets a new MABSA standard, significantly improving accuracy in complex multimodal sentiment analysis.

Abstract: We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

### [6] [AudioJudge: Understanding What Works in Large Audio Model Based Speech Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12705)
*Potsawee Manakul,Woody Haosheng Gan,Michael J. Ryan,Ali Sartaz Khan,Warit Sirichotedumrong,Kunat Pipatanakul,William Held,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AudioJudge, a Large Audio Model (LAM), is proposed as a unified evaluation framework for speech assessment, addressing limitations of specialized systems and poor correlation with human preferences. It excels in audio characteristic detection and human preference simulation, with ensemble methods achieving high correlation (0.91 Spearman) with human rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech evaluation methods are limited by the need for specialized systems and poor correlation with human preferences. This work aims to unify evaluation using LAMs.

Method: AudioJudge is explored for audio characteristic detection (pronunciation, speaking rate, etc.) and human preference simulation. Prompt engineering strategies, like audio concatenation and in-context learning, are investigated. A multi-aspect ensemble method is introduced for general-purpose evaluation.

Result: AudioJudge achieves up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with human preferences. It performs well under noise but suffers from verbosity and positional biases.

Conclusion: AudioJudge provides a robust, unified framework for speech evaluation, though biases require mitigation. It outperforms traditional methods in correlation with human preferences.

Abstract: Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

### [7] [FLEXITOKENS: Flexible Tokenization for Evolving Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12720)
*Abraham Toluase Owodunni,Orevaoghene Ahia,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLEXITOKENS introduces a flexible tokenization method for language models, improving adaptation to new data distributions and reducing token over-fragmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subword tokenizers in LMs are rigid, leading to inefficient tokenization for out-of-distribution data, unseen languages, or scripts.

Method: Develops byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers, using a boundary predictor for variable-length segments and a simplified training objective (FLEXITOKENS).

Result: FLEXITOKENS reduces token over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10% improvements on downstream tasks compared to other tokenizers.

Conclusion: FLEXITOKENS offers a more adaptable and efficient tokenization approach for language models, enhancing performance across diverse tasks and domains.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we
develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.
Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and
data for our experiments will be released at

### [8] [TransEvalnia: Reasoning-based Evaluation and Ranking of Translations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12724)
*Richard Sproat,Tianyu Zhao,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransEvalnia is a prompting-based translation evaluation system that outperforms state-of-the-art methods, aligns with human ratings, and addresses position bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve translation evaluation by providing fine-grained assessments and ranking translations accurately.

Method: Uses reasoning-based prompting with LLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct) and MQM metrics.

Result: Performs as well or better than MT-Ranker, aligns with human raters, and identifies position bias.

Conclusion: TransEvalnia is effective, human-aligned, and open-source, with proposed fixes for position bias.

Abstract: We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the
various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia
performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.
2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from
various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are
presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data,
including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as
code is released.

### [9] [Strategy Adaptation in Large Language Model Werewolf Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12732)
*Fuya Nakamori,Yin Jou Huang,Fei Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for Werewolf agents to dynamically switch strategies based on player attitudes and conversation context, outperforming fixed or implicit strategy agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods using implicit strategies lack adaptability to changing game situations.

Method: Explicitly selects strategies based on game context and estimated player roles.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline agents with fixed or implicit strategies.

Conclusion: Dynamic strategy adaptation improves Werewolf agent performance.

Abstract: This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by
switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players
and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using
prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are
implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research,
we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on
the game context and the estimated roles of other players. We compare the
strategy adaptation Werewolf agents with baseline agents using implicit or
fixed strategies and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

### [10] [Logit Arithmetic Elicits Long Reasoning Capabilities Without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12759)
*Yunxiang Zhang,Muhammad Khalifa,Lechen Zhang,Xin Liu,Ayoung Lee,Xinliang Frederick Zhang,Farima Fatahi Bayat,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO improve reasoning in large models without extra training, using a smaller guider model and logits arithmetic, achieving up to 29% better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if long reasoning abilities in large models can be unlocked without training, using smaller models as guides.

Method: Proposes ThinkLogit (logits arithmetic) and ThinkLogit-DPO (preference optimization) to enhance reasoning in large models with minimal training.

Result: Achieves 26-29% relative improvement in pass@1 on mathematical datasets, with a 21x smaller guider model.

Conclusion: ThinkLogit offers a computationally-efficient way to enhance long reasoning in large models without extensive training.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

### [11] [Synergy: End-to-end Concept Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12769)
*Keli Zheng,Zerong Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Synergy is a language model that bridges abstraction levels via learned routing, outperforming BBPE and Llama3 in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore tokenizer-free architectures and improve efficiency in language models by learning byte-level abstractions.

Method: Trained as a byte-level language model with a learned routing mechanism, comparing performance with BBPE and Llama3.

Result: Synergy produces fewer tokens than BBPE with comparable performance and shows advantages over Llama3. Higher abstraction layers perform better without positional encodings.

Conclusion: Synergy demonstrates the feasibility of tokenizer-free models, enabling more robust and flexible language pipelines.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

### [12] [Learning Robust Negation Text Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12782)
*Thinh Hung Truong,Karin Verspoor,Trevor Cohn,Timothy Baldwin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance negation understanding in text encoders by distilling data from large language models, improving performance on negation tasks while maintaining general benchmark results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller text encoders struggle with capturing negation, impacting downstream tasks. The goal is to improve their negation robustness.

Method: Uses data distillation from large language models with diverse negation patterns, combined with contrastive learning to finetune a BERT-based model.

Result: Significant improvement in negation understanding without compromising general benchmark performance; method also adapts well to LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy effectively enhances negation robustness in text encoders and can be extended to LLMs, benefiting downstream applications.

Abstract: Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

### [13] [Large Language Models' Internal Perception of Symbolic Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12808)
*Andrew Shin,Kunitake Kaneko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can infer basic musical structures from text but lack explicit musical context, showing potential and limitations for symbolic music generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs implicitly model symbolic music, given their success in natural language and other symbolic domains.

Method: Generate symbolic music data from textual prompts, create a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files, and train neural networks for classification and melody tasks.

Result: LLMs infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships, but performance is limited without explicit musical training.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for symbolic music generation but require further refinement to overcome contextual limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

*Xi Ai,Mahardika Krisna Ihsani,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines cross-lingual consistency in multilingual models, focusing on factual knowledge transfer, and evaluates strategies to improve it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance cross-lingual consistency in multilingual models for factual knowledge, ensuring performance parity and factuality across languages.

Method: Analyzes code-mixed coreferential statements and uses interpretability approaches to study model behavior. Evaluates strategies like code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment.

Result: Multilingual models exhibit varying consistency levels influenced by language families and linguistic factors. Code-switching and alignment objectives show promise.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training are key for improving multilingual performance and knowledge consistency.

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

### [15] [Making Language Model a Hierarchical Classifier and Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12930)
*Yihong Wang,Zhonglin Jiang,Ningyuan Xi,Yue Zhao,Qingqing Gu,Xiyuan Chen,Hao Wu,Sheng Xu,Hange Zhou,Yong Chen,Luo Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical decoder architecture for language models, adapting pretrained models to decode simultaneously at intermediate layers, achieving state-of-the-art results on hierarchical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human hierarchical thinking, the study aims to enhance decoder-only models (e.g., GPT, LLaMA) by enabling simultaneous decoding across layers.

Method: Adapts a pretrained model by copying and fine-tuning language heads from the last layer to selected intermediate layers with task-specific inputs.

Result: Experiments show intermediate layers can generate meaningful content, achieving top performance in hierarchical text tasks.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential for a generalized hierarchical reasoner, suggesting future pretraining from scratch.

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of answering questions about tables in Spanish by leveraging LLMs for code generation and table processing.

Method: The approach involves analyzing tables, selecting columns, generating natural language instructions, translating them to Python code, and executing it with error handling, using open-source LLMs and optimized prompts.

Result: Achieved an accuracy score of 85% in the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines LLMs and code generation for high-accuracy table-based question answering in Spanish.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

### [17] [Formalizing Attack Scenario Description: A Proposed Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13076)
*Quentin Goux,Nadira Lammari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a formal UML-based model for describing attack scenarios to aid cybersecurity automation, with applications in attack analysis and script generation for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations need automation in cybersecurity due to evolving threats, but automation requires formalized input data, particularly for attack scenarios.

Method: A novel formal model using UML class diagrams to abstract attack context and scenarios.

Result: The model supports attack analysis and automatic script generation for cybersecurity training.

Conclusion: The research provides a practical framework for enhancing cybersecurity automation through formalized attack scenario modeling.

Abstract: Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

*Marc Brinner,Sina Zarriess*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCSE is an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings of scientific texts, outperforming traditional citation-based approaches by leveraging LLM-generated summaries and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional citation-based approaches for text embeddings do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity, motivating the need for a method that captures true semantic content.

Method: SemCSE uses LLM-generated summaries of scientific abstracts and contrastive learning to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer in embedding space.

Result: SemCSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SciRepEval benchmark and demonstrates stronger semantic separation in embedding space.

Conclusion: SemCSE highlights the benefits of a semantically focused training approach for scientific text embeddings.

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

### [19] [A Computational Framework to Identify Self-Aspects in Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13115)
*Jaya Caporusso,Matthew Purver,Senja Pollak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This Ph.D. proposal aims to create a computational framework for identifying Self-aspects in text, leveraging NLP to explore this underexplored area. It includes developing an ontology, annotated dataset, and evaluating models for interpretability, accuracy, and efficiency, with applications in mental health and phenomenology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Self is a complex construct reflected in language but underexplored in NLP. Its aspects align with psychological phenomena, necessitating systematic analysis.

Method: Develop an ontology and annotated dataset, then evaluate discriminative models, generative LLMs, and embedding-based retrieval approaches against interpretability, accuracy, and efficiency.

Result: Top-performing models will be identified and applied in mental health and phenomenology case studies.

Conclusion: The framework will advance NLP's role in understanding the Self, with practical applications in psychology and phenomenology.

Abstract: This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

### [20] [Assessing the Reliability of LLMs Annotations in the Context of Demographic Bias and Model Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13138)
*Hadi Mohammadi,Tina Shahedi,Pablo Mosteiro,Massimo Poesio,Ayoub Bagheri,Anastasia Giachanou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how annotator demographics and text content influence labeling in sexism detection, finding content dominates. It also evaluates GenAI models as annotators, showing persona prompting often fails, and XAI reveals reliance on content-specific tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand variability in annotations for fair NLP systems, particularly in sexism detection, and assess the role of annotator demographics versus text content.

Method: Used a Generalized Linear Mixed Model to quantify annotator demographic influence and evaluated GenAI models with demographic personas, applying XAI techniques.

Result: Demographic factors account for 8% of variance, with content being dominant. Persona prompting in GenAI often degrades performance, and XAI shows reliance on content-specific tokens.

Conclusion: Focusing on content-driven explanations and robust annotation protocols is more reliable for fairness than persona simulation.

Abstract: Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses machine learning to analyze oral narratives of Afrikaans- and isiXhosa-speaking children, identifying features like lexical diversity and utterance length as predictors of typical development, while specific verbs and auxiliaries correlate with reduced intervention need.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency in multilingual contexts for early assessment.

Method: Simple machine learning analysis of recorded stories from four- and five-year-old children speaking Afrikaans and isiXhosa.

Result: Lexical diversity and utterance length indicate typical development; specific verbs and auxiliaries reduce intervention likelihood. Cross-linguistic variation exists.

Conclusion: The study highlights both language-specific and shared narrative features, aiding early assessment in multilingual settings.

Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

*Jisoo Lee,Raeyoung Chang,Dongwook Kwon,Harmanpreet Singh,Nikhil Verma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GEMMAS is a graph-based framework evaluating multi-agent collaboration by analyzing communication efficiency and coordination, using metrics like IDS and UPR to reveal process-level inefficiencies not captured by outcome-only metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of multi-agent systems focus solely on final output correctness, ignoring inefficiencies in communication and coordination that lead to redundant reasoning and higher computational costs.

Method: Introduces GEMMAS, a graph-based framework modeling agent interactions as a directed acyclic graph, with metrics IDS (Information Diversity Score) and UPR (Unnecessary Path Ratio) to assess collaboration quality.

Result: On GSM8K, systems with minor accuracy differences (2.1%) showed significant variations in IDS (12.8%) and UPR (80%), highlighting inefficiencies in internal collaboration.

Conclusion: Outcome-only metrics are insufficient; process-level diagnostics like GEMMAS are crucial for designing interpretable and resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

*R. Louw,E. Sharratt,F. de Wet,C. Jacobs,A. Smith,H. Kamper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An automated system assesses preschool children's oral narratives in Afrikaans and isiXhosa using speech recognition and machine learning, outperforming linear models and matching human experts in identifying intervention needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to accurately identify students needing intervention for narrative and comprehension skills, which are critical for later literacy.

Method: The system uses automatic speech recognition and machine learning (linear model vs. large language model) to predict narrative and comprehension scores from oral narratives.

Result: The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model and is comparable to human experts in flagging children needing intervention.

Conclusion: The system provides a foundation for automated oral assessments, enabling teachers to focus on personalized support for children's learning.

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for
automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and
isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine
learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For
scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language
model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,
but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based
system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require
intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in
classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for
children's learning.

*Xinyu Tang,Zhihao Lv,Xiaoxue Cheng,Junyi Li,Wayne Xin Zhao,Zujie Wen,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes CAST, a framework for cross-task transfer in LLMs by steering latent space activations, improving robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with unseen tasks in data-scarce scenarios, and existing cross-task in-context learning lacks robustness and scalability.

Method: Analyzes activation patterns in LLMs' latent space, then uses contrastive representation-enhanced activations from high-resource tasks to adapt to low-resource tasks.

Result: CAST outperforms baselines in cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer, showing scalability and lower computational costs.

Conclusion: Latent space steering enables effective cross-task transfer without parameter updates or input expansion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HATS, a Hindi Analogy Test Set, to evaluate multilingual LLMs' reasoning in Hindi. It finds models perform best with English prompts and proposes a grounded Chain of Thought method to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' reasoning in Indic languages, particularly Hindi, which is understudied compared to English.

Method: Introduces HATS (405 Hindi analogy questions), benchmarks multilingual LLMs with various prompts, and proposes a grounded Chain of Thought approach.

Result: Models perform best with English prompts. The grounded Chain of Thought method improves Hindi analogy performance.

Conclusion: HATS fills a gap in evaluating LLM reasoning in Hindi, highlighting the need for better multilingual generalization.

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in
Hindi.

*Lyucheng Wu,Mengru Wang,Ziwen Xu,Tri Cao,Nay Oo,Bryan Hooi,Shumin Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSteer is a modular, inference-time intervention technology for MLLMs that improves safety without fine-tuning, using Safety Awareness Scores, adaptive probing, and a Refusal Head.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety concerns in MLLMs posed by adversarial multimodal inputs.

Method: AutoSteer integrates SAS, adaptive safety probing, and a Refusal Head to detect and mitigate safety risks during inference.

Result: Significantly reduces Attack Success Rate for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats while preserving model performance.

Conclusion: AutoSteer is a practical and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QuestA, a question augmentation method, improves RL training for LLMs by introducing partial solutions, enhancing reasoning performance on hard math problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the ineffectiveness of standard RL in improving multi-step reasoning, especially on challenging problems.

Method: Propose QuestA: augment questions with partial solutions during RL training to reduce difficulty and provide better learning signals.

Result: Achieves SOTA results on math benchmarks (e.g., 67.1% on AIME24) and improves pass@1 and pass@k metrics.

Conclusion: QuestA enhances reasoning capabilities and sample efficiency, offering a scalable solution for RL in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TalentCLEF 2025 introduces the first public benchmark for skill and job title intelligence in Human Capital Management, addressing gaps in reliable and fair language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of reliable, fair models and public benchmarks in Human Capital Management drives the need for TalentCLEF 2025.

Method: Two tasks: Multilingual Job Title Matching (Task A) and Job Title-Based Skill Prediction (Task B), using real anonymized data and manual annotation.

Result: 76 teams participated, with systems using multilingual encoder models and large language models. Training strategies proved more impactful than model size.

Conclusion: TalentCLEF establishes a benchmark for robust, fair, and transferable language technologies in the labor market.

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods produce inconsistent and suboptimal presentations, failing professional standards.

Method: RCPS integrates Deep Structured Narrative Planning, Adaptive Layout Generation, and an Iterative Optimization Loop. PREVAL evaluates quality using rationale-enhanced models.

Result: RCPS outperforms baselines, nearing human expert standards. PREVAL correlates well with human judgments.

Conclusion: RCPS and PREVAL advance automated presentation quality, addressing prior limitations.

Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated
tool for assessing presentation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AbGen is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in designing ablation studies, revealing a performance gap between models and humans. Current automated evaluations are unreliable, prompting the creation of AbGen-Eval for meta-evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve LLMs' ability to design scientifically sound ablation studies, as current models lag behind human experts.

Method: AbGen uses 1,500 expert-annotated examples from NLP papers to evaluate LLMs. AbGen-Eval assesses the reliability of automated evaluation methods.

Result: LLMs like DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini underperform humans in importance, faithfulness, and soundness. Automated evaluations show discrepancies with human judgments.

Conclusion: AbGen highlights LLMs' limitations in ablation study design and underscores the need for better evaluation methods, as demonstrated by AbGen-Eval.

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

*Guimin Hu,Daniel Hershcovich,Hasti Seifi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HapticCap, a dataset for matching haptic vibrations to user descriptions, addressing challenges in haptic signal design. A supervised contrastive learning framework is proposed for haptic-caption retrieval, with T5 and AST models performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing meaningful haptic signals is challenging due to the lack of large annotated datasets and limited models for describing vibrations in text.

Method: Created HapticCap, a dataset of 92,070 haptic-text pairs, and proposed a supervised contrastive learning framework for haptic-caption retrieval.

Result: The T5 and AST models combined achieved the best performance in the retrieval task, especially when trained separately for each description category.

Conclusion: HapticCap and the proposed framework advance haptic signal design by enabling better matching of vibrations to user descriptions.

Abstract: Haptic signals, from smartphone vibrations to virtual reality touch feedback,
can effectively convey information and enhance realism, but designing signals
that resonate meaningfully with users is challenging. To facilitate this, we
introduce a multimodal dataset and task, of matching user descriptions to
vibration haptic signals, and highlight two primary challenges: (1) lack of
large haptic vibration datasets annotated with textual descriptions as
collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Search engines amplify bias through content prioritization and ideologically-driven user queries, reinforcing ideological divides and information polarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how search engines and user queries contribute to bias in search results, particularly in political and social contexts.

Method: Analysis of search engine outputs using a dataset of political and social topics.

Result: Search engines prioritize biased content, and ideologically-driven queries worsen bias, amplifying specific narratives. Differences in source prioritization were noted across search engines.

Conclusion: Search engines shape public perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, contributing to information polarization.

Abstract: Search engines play a crucial role in shaping public discourse by influencing
how information is accessed and framed. While prior research has extensively
examined various dimensions of search bias -- such as content prioritization,
indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These

*Yulu Qin,Dheeraj Varghese,Adam Dahlgren Lindström,Lucia Donatelli,Kanishka Misra,Najoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VL training improves deployment of taxonomic knowledge in tasks but doesn't significantly change the knowledge itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if VL training meaningfully alters linguistic representations, focusing on lexical-conceptual and taxonomic knowledge.

Method: Compare text-only LMs and VL-trained models using behavioral and representational analyses on a text-only QA task.

Result: VL models outperform text-only models in taxonomic QA tasks, but their taxonomic knowledge remains similar. Differences lie in how they represent taxonomic vs. non-taxonomic relations.

Conclusion: VL training enhances task-specific deployment of taxonomic knowledge without fundamentally altering the knowledge itself.

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

*Zhouqi Hua,Wenwei Zhang,Chengqi Lyu,Yuzhe Gu,Songyang Gao,Kuikun Liu,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAIL, a method to improve length generalization in LLMs by imitating Turing Machine execution, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of length generalization in LLMs by focusing on computable reasoning problems solvable by Turing Machines.

Method: Proposes TAIL, which synthesizes chain-of-thought data mimicking Turing Machine execution, using atomic states and explicit memory fetch mechanisms.

Result: TAIL significantly enhances length generalization and performance on a synthetic dataset, surpassing prior methods.

Conclusion: Key Turing Machine concepts are crucial for TAIL's success, offering a promising direction for LLM reasoning research.

Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context Engineering, a systematic approach to optimizing contextual information for LLMs, and identifies a research gap in model capabilities for generating sophisticated outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and advance the optimization of contextual information for LLMs, addressing the asymmetry in model capabilities.

Method: A comprehensive taxonomy of Context Engineering, analyzing foundational components (retrieval, generation, processing, management) and system implementations (RAG, memory systems, multi-agent systems).

Result: Identifies a critical gap: LLMs excel in understanding complex contexts but struggle with generating sophisticated long-form outputs.

Conclusion: The survey provides a unified framework for advancing context-aware AI and highlights future research priorities.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

### [36] [Comparing Apples to Oranges: A Dataset & Analysis of LLM Humour Understanding from Traditional Puns to Topical Jokes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13335)
*Tyler Loakman,William Thorne,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines if Large Language Models (LLMs) can explain different humor types, finding they struggle with complex jokes requiring world knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational humor research focuses on simple puns, ignoring more complex humor forms. This work explores LLMs' ability to explain diverse joke types.

Method: A dataset of 600 jokes across 4 types (heterographic/homographic puns, internet humor, topical jokes) was curated. LLMs' zero-shot explanation abilities were tested.

Result: No tested LLM reliably explained all joke types, especially those needing world knowledge, revealing gaps in computational humor research.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are limited in explaining complex humor, highlighting the narrow focus of prior work on simple joke forms.

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.

Motivation: To enhance transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without requiring additional model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: EaGERS improves performance and interpretability in DocVQA without fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that
(1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2)
grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal
embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3)
restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MindJourney enhances VLMs' 3D spatial reasoning by coupling them with a video diffusion-based world model, improving performance on benchmarks like SAT by 8% without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack 3D spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to predict scene changes after egocentric motion.

Method: MindJourney pairs a VLM with a controllable world model, iteratively sketching camera trajectories and synthesizing views for multi-view reasoning.

Result: Achieves an 8% performance boost on the SAT benchmark and outperforms reinforcement learning-trained VLMs.

Conclusion: MindJourney offers a plug-and-play solution for robust 3D reasoning by leveraging world models at test time.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mono-InternVL and Mono-InternVL-1.5, monolithic MLLMs addressing unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting via delta tuning and visual experts. EViP and EViP++ enhance visual capabilities, reducing costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monolithic MLLMs face unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. The goal is to improve stability and efficiency in visual-language integration.

Method: Embed a new visual parameter space into a pre-trained LLM using delta tuning. Introduce Mono-InternVL with multimodal MoE architecture and EViP for progressive learning. Enhance with EViP++ for cost efficiency.

Result: Mono-InternVL outperforms existing MLLMs on 12/15 benchmarks (e.g., +114-point improvement on OCRBench). Mono-InternVL-1.5 reduces costs while matching performance.

Conclusion: The proposed monolithic MLLMs achieve competitive performance with improved stability and efficiency, validated by extensive benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows compares supervised methods and transfer learning, identifying optimal preprocessing and models for accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the best workflows for crop mapping using remote sensing data, addressing challenges in supervised learning and transfer learning for diverse agricultural sites.

Method: Systematic experiments compared six preprocessing methods and eleven supervised classification models, alongside transfer learning techniques, evaluated across five agricultural sites using Landsat 8 data.

Result: Fine-scale preprocessing with Transformer models performed best. RF was efficient for supervised learning. Transfer learning (UDA or fine-tuning) improved adaptability, with workflow choice depending on labeled sample availability.

Conclusion: Supervised training excels with sufficient samples, while transfer learning is viable for limited data, with method selection tailored to domain shift and sample size.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

Motivation: Understanding radiologists' eye movements during CT reading is essential for interpretable computer-aided diagnosis systems, but existing research is limited by lack of datasets and 3D complexity.

Method: The authors present CT-ScanGaze dataset and develop CT-Searcher, a 3D scanpath predictor. They also create a pipeline to convert 2D gaze data into 3D for pretraining.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on CT-ScanGaze show the effectiveness of CT-Searcher and provide a framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical imaging.

Conclusion: The work advances 3D gaze prediction for CT scans, offering a dataset, model, and evaluation framework to improve interpretable diagnosis systems.

Abstract: Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical

TL;DR: MS-DGCNN++ improves tree species classification from LiDAR point clouds by using hierarchical multiscale fusion and cross-scale feature propagation, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture semantic relationships in tree structures due to parallel multi-scale processing, limiting accuracy in complex forest environments.

Method: MS-DGCNN++ employs hierarchical multiscale fusion with scale-specific feature engineering (local, branch, canopy) and cross-scale information propagation.

Result: Achieves 94.96% accuracy on STPCTLS, 67.25% on FOR-species20K, and outperforms DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and PPT. Also excels in 3D object recognition (93.15% on ModelNet40).

Conclusion: MS-DGCNN++ is a versatile, efficient solution for tree species classification and 3D object recognition, with lower complexity than transformer-based approaches.

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at

Motivation: Limited annotated datasets for action anticipation in real-world sports, especially soccer penalty kicks, hinder progress in Human Action Recognition (HAR).

Method: A deep learning classifier integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with contextual metadata, tested across 22 backbone models from seven architecture families.

Result: The model achieves 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right), surpassing real goalkeepers' decisions.

Conclusion: The dataset and model show promise for anticipatory action recognition and generalizable sports-based predictive tasks.

Abstract: Action anticipation has become a prominent topic in Human Action Recognition
(HAR). However, its application to real-world sports scenarios remains limited
by the availability of suitable annotated datasets. This work presents a novel
dataset of manually annotated soccer penalty kicks to predict shot direction
based on pre-kick player movements. We propose a deep learning classifier to
benchmark this dataset that integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with
contextual metadata. We evaluate twenty-two backbone models across seven
architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D),
achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the
dataset's value for anticipatory action recognition and validate our model's
potential as a generalizable approach for sports-based predictive tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Funnel-HOI introduces a top-down framework for human-object interaction detection, leveraging object and action cues at the encoder stage with an asymmetric co-attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the long-tail distribution problem in HOID by anticipating HOI-specific cues early in the encoder stage for stronger scene interpretation.

Method: Probes images for objects first, then actions, using an asymmetric co-attention mechanism and a novel loss function for better interaction classification.

Result: Achieves up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI categories on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets.

Conclusion: Funnel-HOI's encoder-focused approach and novel loss function significantly improve HOID performance, especially in zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for dynamic scene novel-view synthesis using monocular videos, combining 3D reconstruction and 2D video diffusion models, outperforming prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of prior methods, which either require costly optimization or fail to preserve geometry in feed-forward training, for dynamic scene synthesis.

Method: Uses covisible pixel rendering via 3D reconstruction and hidden pixel inpainting with a self-supervised 2D video diffusion model (CogNVS), enabling zero-shot application.

Result: CogNVS outperforms most prior methods for dynamic scene novel-view synthesis from monocular videos.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines 3D reconstruction and diffusion models, achieving superior performance with minimal test-time optimization.

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

*Inamullah,Ernesto Elias Vidal Rosas,Imran Razzak,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces an imaging omics framework combining retinal microvascular traits and serum lipidomic data to identify early CVD biomarkers, revealing strong correlations between vascular features and specific lipid subclasses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CVD risk stratification methods often miss early, subclinical changes. The study aims to integrate retinal microvasculature and lipidomic profiles for better early detection.

Method: Used deep learning for retinal image analysis and UHPLC ESI HRMS for serum lipid profiling in a healthy population, adjusting for covariates.

Result: Found strong correlations between retinal traits (artery width, vessel density) and lipid subclasses (TAGs, DAGs, Cers), suggesting microvascular remodeling under metabolic stress.

Conclusion: The study provides novel insights into early CVD pathogenesis and potential non-invasive biomarkers, improving early detection and personalized healthcare.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration

Motivation: The challenge of achieving high accuracy in structural defect segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time deployment.

Method: FORTRESS combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network integration, featuring systematic parameter reduction, adaptive function composition, and multi-scale attention fusion.

Result: Achieves 91% parameter reduction, 91% computational complexity reduction, 3x inference speed improvement, and state-of-the-art segmentation performance (F1-score 0.771, mean IoU 0.677).

Conclusion: FORTRESS is a robust solution for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained environments, excelling in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained
environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuraLeaf is a neural parametric model for 3D leaves, addressing challenges in plant modeling by disentangling 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. It leverages 2D datasets and introduces a skeleton-free skinning model, validated on a new 3D leaf dataset (DeformLeaf).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plant leaves' diverse shapes and flexible deformation pose unique challenges, unlike humans/animals, necessitating a specialized neural parametric model for accurate 3D modeling and reconstruction.

Method: NeuraLeaf separates leaf geometry into 2D base shapes and 3D deformations, using 2D datasets for base shapes and a novel skeleton-free skinning model for deformations. A new dataset, DeformLeaf, is created for validation.

Result: NeuraLeaf generates diverse leaf shapes with deformation, achieving accurate fitting to 3D observations (depth maps, point clouds).

Conclusion: NeuraLeaf effectively models 3D leaves, leveraging 2D data and novel deformation techniques, with potential applications in agriculture and computer graphics.

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, ensuring visual quality and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: HairShifter sets a robust baseline for video hairstyle transfer, with potential applications in various domains.

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor
Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with
smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) due to multi-scale structural heterogeneity and lack of object-level insights in conventional methods.

Method: Proposes Mamba Snake, using hierarchical state space atlas and Mamba Evolution Block (MEB) for spatiotemporal information aggregation and energy map shape priors. Includes dual-classification synergy for detection and segmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a 3% average Dice improvement across five clinical datasets.

Conclusion: Mamba Snake effectively addresses UMIS challenges, offering robust performance in complex medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Enhancing human-computer interaction through immersive and empathetic engagement by improving emotional expressiveness in text-driven talking-head generation.

Method: Proposes the Think-Before-Draw framework, using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for semantic parsing and a progressive guidance denoising strategy for fine-grained expressiveness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks MEAD and HDTF, with demonstrated zero-shot generation capability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap between high-level emotion semantics and detailed facial motion, advancing natural emotional expressiveness in generated videos.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

Result: The framework enhances accuracy and lead time of accident anticipation, validated on public and new datasets.

Conclusion: The solution addresses data and modeling limitations, advancing safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models rely heavily on task-specific human demonstrations, limiting generalization and increasing data acquisition costs.

Method: Proposes ATARA for scalable self-supervised data collection and AnyPos, an inverse dynamics model with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and Direction-Aware Decoder, to handle task-agnostic data.

Result: The AnyPos-ATARA pipeline improves test accuracy by 51% and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in downstream tasks like lifting and pick-and-place.

Conclusion: The framework enhances scalability and efficiency in task-agnostic action paradigms, demonstrating significant improvements in performance and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

TL;DR: ReToM improves Stable Diffusion's efficiency by merging tokens locally, preserving key features while reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of attention operations in Stable Diffusion without compromising image quality.

Method: Introduces local representative token guided merging (ReToM), adjusting window sizes and selecting representative tokens per window.

Result: Achieves 6.2% better FID and higher CLIP scores with comparable inference time.

Conclusion: ReToM effectively balances visual quality and computational efficiency in image generation.

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of vision transformers by reducing computational complexity while maintaining or improving performance, leveraging theoretical insights.

Method: Integrates differentiable channel selection in MLP layers of transformer blocks, guided by a novel generalization bound, to prune channels in a generalization-aware manner.

Result: KCR-Transformer reduces FLOPs and parameters while matching or surpassing the accuracy of original models like ViT and Swin.

Conclusion: KCR-Transformer is a theoretically grounded, efficient alternative for vision transformers, compatible with popular architectures and effective across tasks.

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SVM-City, a multidomain outdoor scene understanding dataset, and City-VLM, a model for multimodal fusion, addressing limitations of existing LVLMs in outdoor scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs focus on indoor tasks and lack capabilities for outdoor large-scale scene understanding due to limited data and ineffective 2D-3D integration.

Method: Developed SVM-City dataset with 420k images, 4,811M point clouds, and 567k QA pairs. Proposed City-VLM using incomplete multimodal learning and joint probabilistic distribution for fusion.

Result: City-VLM outperforms existing LVLMs by 18.14% in QA tasks and shows strong generalization across outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: The SVM-City dataset and City-VLM model effectively address outdoor scene understanding challenges, demonstrating superior performance and practicality.

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: DeQA-Doc successfully extends MLLM capabilities to document quality assessment, offering a robust and effective solution.

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

### [64] [Semantic-guided Fine-tuning of Foundation Model for Long-tailed Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12807)
*Yufei Peng,Yonggang Zhang,Yiu-ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Sage, a method for long-tailed visual recognition by integrating semantic guidance from text into visual fine-tuning and addressing prediction bias with a novel compensation factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed scenarios degrade performance in less frequent classes. Foundation models offer potential, but existing methods overlook visual-textual alignment and inconsistent class distributions.

Method: Introduces Sage with an SG-Adapter to integrate class descriptions as semantic guidance and a distribution mismatch-aware compensation factor to rectify prediction bias.

Result: Sage enhances performance in long-tailed learning, as shown by experiments on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Sage effectively improves long-tailed recognition by aligning visual and textual modalities and addressing prediction bias.

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

### [65] [FIQ: Fundamental Question Generation with the Integration of Question Embeddings for Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12816)
*Ju-Young Oh,Ho-Joong Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIQ, a method for video question answering (VQA) that generates Q&A pairs from video descriptions to improve model reasoning and generalization. It includes a VQ-CAlign module for better task-specific embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art results on SUTD-TrafficQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods rely on event-centric Q&A pairs, missing broader context like object types and spatial layouts, limiting generalization and reasoning.

Method: FIQ generates Q&A pairs from video descriptions to enrich training data and incorporates a VQ-CAlign module for aligning question embeddings with visual features.

Result: FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on SUTD-TrafficQA, demonstrating improved generalization and reasoning.

Conclusion: FIQ enhances VQA by addressing the lack of fundamental scene understanding, leading to better performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

### [66] [MCoT-RE: Multi-Faceted Chain-of-Thought and Re-Ranking for Training-Free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12819)
*Jeong-Woo Park,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCoT-RE is a training-free zero-shot CIR framework using multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought and re-ranking to improve retrieval accuracy by balancing text modifications and visual context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot CIR methods either lose information in sequential processing or fail to fully utilize visual context, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: MCoT-RE employs multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to generate two captions (modification-focused and context-integrated) and performs two-stage re-ranking for precise retrieval.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results, with improvements of 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

Conclusion: MCoT-RE effectively balances textual modifications and visual context, outperforming existing training-free CIR methods.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

### [67] [FAR-Net: Multi-Stage Fusion Network with Enhanced Semantic Alignment and Adaptive Reconciliation for Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12823)
*Jeong-Woo Park,Young-Eun Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAR-Net is a multi-stage fusion framework for composed image retrieval (CIR) that combines late and early fusion to improve semantic alignment and adaptability, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods struggle with balancing visual context and fine-grained textual details due to limitations in early or late fusion approaches.

Method: FAR-Net integrates two modules: ESAM (late fusion with cross-attention for semantic alignment) and ARM (early fusion with uncertainty embeddings for robustness).

Result: FAR-Net achieves performance gains of up to 2.4% in Recall@1 and 1.04% in Recall@50 on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets.

Conclusion: FAR-Net offers a robust and scalable solution for CIR by effectively combining late and early fusion strategies.

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

specifically designed to address fine-grained food images and accurately
capture subtle features within them. The FE-TResNet method is based on the
TResNet model and integrates Style-based Recalibration Module (StyleRM) and
Deep Channel-wise Attention (DCA) technologies to enhance feature extraction
capabilities. In experimental validation on Chinese food image datasets

classification accuracy, achieving rates of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively,
demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image
classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT) is challenging for tiny targets, and existing methods struggle with detection and appearance-based association. The SMOT4SB challenge aims to leverage temporal information to overcome these issues.

Method: The paper presents the SMOT4SB dataset (211 UAV sequences, 108,192 frames), the SO-HOTA metric (combining Dot Distance with HOTA), and a competitive challenge (MVA2025) to evaluate methods.

Result: The winning method in the MVA2025 challenge achieved a 5.1x improvement over the baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: This work advances SMOT for UAV scenarios, with potential applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Small Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT) is particularly challenging when targets
occupy only a few dozen pixels, rendering detection and appearance-based
association unreliable. Building on the success of the MVA2023 SOD4SB
challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages
temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological

Motivation: Existing models lack fine-grained control and reliable evaluation for controllable captioning, limiting precise multimodal alignment and instruction following.

Method: ACM enhances existing foundation models without retraining, reusing original captions while incorporating user instructions and modality features. ACD provides diverse data, and AnyCapEval offers decoupled evaluation metrics.

Result: ACM improves caption quality significantly, with ACM-8B boosting GPT-4o's content scores by 45% and style scores by 12%, and performing well on other benchmarks.

Conclusion: The AnyCap Project addresses gaps in controllable captioning with a practical framework, dataset, and evaluation benchmark, demonstrating substantial improvements.

Abstract: Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores
by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on

Method: Proposes a transformer-based architecture with Static Expansion, Memory-Augmented Self-Attention, and Mesh Transformer techniques.

Result: Best model outperforms state-of-the-art on UCM-Caption and NWPU-Caption datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential for real-life remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Image captioning has emerged as a crucial task in the intersection of
computer vision and natural language processing, enabling automated generation
of descriptive text from visual content. In the context of remote sensing,
image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex
satellite imagery, aiding applications such as environmental monitoring,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SRE, an attention-refocusing scheme for domain generalization (DG) using CLIP, to improve performance on unseen target domains by aligning attention maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with focusing on domain-invariant regions, leading to suboptimal DG performance.

Method: SRE simulates domain shifts via augmentation, refocuses attention in CLIP, and uses ensemble learning to capture domain-invariant attention.

Result: SRE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: SRE effectively reduces domain shift and enhances generalization by aligning attention maps.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing instance segmentation methods are limited to close-vocabulary prediction, hindering their ability to recognize novel categories or generalize across datasets, which is crucial for diverse Earth observation scenarios.

Method: Proposes SCORE, which integrates regional and global context to enhance visual and textual representations. Includes Region-Aware Integration for refining class embeddings and Global Context Adaptation for enriching text embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-vocabulary remote sensing instance segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating robustness for large-scale geospatial analysis.

Conclusion: SCORE provides a scalable and effective solution for open-vocabulary instance segmentation in remote sensing, advancing the field for real-world applications.

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRSeg improves reasoning segmentation by enhancing perceptual resolution with HRP and HRE modules, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from low perceptual resolution due to pre-trained visual encoders at lower resolutions, and interpolation methods are inefficient.

Method: Proposes HRSeg with HRP (High-Resolution Perception) for multi-granularity feature integration and HRE (High-Resolution Enhancement) for fine-grained mask-text alignment.

Result: Ablation studies confirm module effectiveness; HRSeg outperforms benchmarks in segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: HRSeg efficiently addresses perceptual resolution limitations, achieving superior segmentation performance.

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that
leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes
embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures
dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out

Result: The approach reveals emotions as outcomes of human-environment interactions, enabling real-time, continuous recognition with high generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable, low-cost solution for user-unaware emotion recognition by leveraging gaze dynamics and environmental context.

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

### [78] [LanePerf: a Performance Estimation Framework for Lane Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12894)
*Yin Wu,Daniel Slieter,Ahmed Abouelazm,Christian Hubschneider,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LanePerf, a framework for estimating lane detection model performance without ground-truth labels, outperforming baselines in diverse domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in lane detection models require resource-intensive data collection; label-free performance estimation is underexplored.

Method: Adapts five image classification methods to lane detection, then introduces LanePerf, integrating image and lane features using a pretrained encoder and DeepSets.

Result: LanePerf achieves MAE of 0.117 and Spearman's rank correlation of 0.727, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: LanePerf enables robust, label-free performance estimation, enhancing ADAS safety and efficiency.

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

### [79] [Federated Learning for Commercial Image Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12903)
*Shreyansh Jain,Koteswar Rao Jerripothula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset for Federated Learning with 23,326 images from 8 sources, classified into 31 categories, is introduced. Two novel algorithms, Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star, outperform baselines on this dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a privacy-preserving collaborative learning platform and address the lack of image classification datasets specifically designed for Federated Learning.

Method: Fed-Cyclic uses a cyclic topology for weight updates, while Fed-Star employs a star-like topology with pre-aggregation to handle statistical heterogeneity.

Result: Both proposed algorithms perform better than existing baselines on the new dataset.

Conclusion: The new dataset and algorithms enhance Federated Learning for image classification, demonstrating improved performance and privacy preservation.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

*Tomohiro Suzuki,Ryota Tanaka,Calvin Yeung,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the AthleticsPose dataset for monocular 3D pose estimation in sports, showing improved accuracy over imitated datasets and highlighting practical limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear reliability of monocular 3D pose estimation for sports tasks.

Method: Introduce the AthleticsPose dataset, train a 3D pose estimation model, and evaluate its performance compared to a baseline model.

Result: Model trained on AthleticsPose reduces MPJPE by ~75% over the baseline, but accuracy varies with camera view and subject scale.

Conclusion: Authentic sports motion data is crucial for accurate pose estimation, though challenges remain for high-speed metrics. The dataset and findings aid future research.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

### [81] [Argus: Leveraging Multiview Images for Improved 3-D Scene Understanding With Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12916)
*Yifan Xu,Chao Zhang,Hanqi Jiang,Xiaoyan Wang,Ruifei Ma,Yiwei Li,Zihao Wu,Zeju Li,Xiangde Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Argus is a 3D multimodal framework combining multi-view images, text, and point clouds to enhance 3D scene understanding with LLMs, addressing information loss in point cloud reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D point cloud methods suffer from information loss, especially with textureless planes or complex objects, while 2D multi-view images offer detailed representations to compensate.

Method: Argus integrates multi-view images, camera poses, and 3D point clouds into view-as-scene features, creating detailed 3D-aware embeddings for LLMs.

Result: Argus outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in downstream tasks by compensating for reconstruction deficiencies.

Conclusion: Argus advances 3D scene understanding by leveraging multimodal inputs, improving LLM capabilities for 3D tasks.

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

*Dongyeun Lee,Jiwan Hur,Hyounguk Shon,Jae Young Lee,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMQ combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to improve quantization in diffusion models, outperforming existing methods at low bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational costs and performance degradation in diffusion models due to quantization, especially at low bit-widths.

Method: Uses LES to optimize scaling factors and PTS for activations, with adaptive timestep weighting and a voting algorithm for reliable PTS factor selection.

Result: DMQ outperforms existing methods, maintaining high image quality and stability at low bit-widths like W4A6 and W4A8.

Conclusion: DMQ effectively addresses quantization challenges in diffusion models, offering a robust solution for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of selecting optimal deep learning architectures for landslide detection while avoiding overfitting.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances performance and avoids overfitting in landslide detection.

Abstract: The use of satellite imagery combined with deep learning to support automatic
landslide detection is becoming increasingly widespread. However, selecting an
appropriate deep learning architecture to optimize performance while avoiding
overfitting remains a critical challenge. To address these issues, we propose a
deep-learning based framework for landslide detection from remote sensing image
in this paper. The proposed framework presents an effective combination of the
online an offline data augmentation to tackle the imbalanced data, a backbone
EfficientNet\_Large deep learning model for extracting robust embedding
features, and a post-processing SVM classifier to balance and enhance the
classification performance. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.8938
on the public test set of the Zindi challenge.

*Yafei Zhang,Lingqi Kong,Huafeng Li,Jie Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised cross-modal person ReID method is proposed, using single-modal labels to address missing cross-modal labels, leveraging expert collaboration for robust identity correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on labeled cross-modal samples in visible-infrared person ReID, addressing scenarios where cross-modal labels are unavailable.

Method: A heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework trains modality-specific experts, uses them as predictors for cross-modal samples, and integrates predictions via a fusion mechanism.

Result: The method enhances modality-invariant feature extraction and cross-modal identity recognition, validated on two datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses weakly supervised cross-modal ReID, improving performance without cross-modal labels.

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Yucheng Tang,Yunguan Fu,Weixi Yi,Yipei Wang,Daniel C. Alexander,Rhodri Davies,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUPM, a model for analyzing uncertainties in multimodal inputs (text and images) for large language models, showing its robustness, generalizability, and clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify uncertainties in multimodal inputs (image-only, text-only, and joint) for large-scale MLLMs, and explore their clinical applications.

Method: Proposes MUPM, a multimodal uncertainty propagation model, tested on real clinical data (cardiac MR scans and health records) with few samples.

Result: MUPM is robust, generalizable across data distributions and tasks, and enables clinical applications like uncertainty estimation for disease prediction.

Conclusion: MUPM effectively quantifies multimodal uncertainties, offering practical clinical benefits and efficiency in data usage.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

*Jiaxiu Jiang,Wenbo Li,Jingjing Ren,Yuping Qiu,Yong Guo,Xiaogang Xu,Han Wu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoViC is a DiT-based framework for generating long, coherent videos using a segment-wise process and FlexFormer, an autoencoder for unified latent representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling text-to-video generation to long durations is challenging due to quadratic complexity in self-attention; prior solutions compromise coherence or scalability.

Method: LoViC employs FlexFormer, an autoencoder compressing video and text into latent representations, with variable-length inputs and position-aware mechanisms.

Result: The approach supports diverse tasks like prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot generation, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: LoViC effectively addresses long-duration video generation challenges while maintaining coherence and scalability.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionThink dynamically adjusts visual token resolution for VLMs, improving efficiency without compromising performance on most tasks, except OCR-related ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most real-world scenarios don't require extensive visual tokens, and performance remains high with lower resolution, except for OCR tasks.

Method: Proposes VisionThink, which starts with downsampled images and requests higher resolution only if needed, using reinforcement learning and LLM-as-Judge strategy.

Result: Achieves strong fine-grained visual understanding for OCR tasks while saving tokens on simpler tasks, with stable performance.

Conclusion: VisionThink is superior, efficient, and effective, demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

TL;DR: cIDIR is a novel DIR framework using INRs to condition registration on regularization hyperparameters, avoiding costly retraining and enabling advanced regularization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning regularization parameters in learning-based DIR is computationally expensive, requiring multiple training iterations.

Method: Proposes cIDIR, an INR-based framework trained over a prior distribution of hyperparameters, optimized using segmentation masks, and modeling a continuous DVF.

Result: Achieves high accuracy and robustness on the DIR-LAB dataset.

Conclusion: cIDIR efficiently handles regularization hyperparameters and integrates advanced techniques, improving DIR performance.

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

TL;DR: FantasyPortrait is a diffusion transformer framework for high-fidelity, emotion-rich facial animations, addressing challenges in cross reenactment and multi-character scenarios with novel learning and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods using geometric priors often produce artifacts and struggle with subtle emotions or multi-character animation due to feature interference.

Method: Uses a diffusion transformer with expression-augmented learning for identity-agnostic facial dynamics and a masked cross-attention mechanism for multi-character control.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross reenactment and multi-character animation, validated by quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: FantasyPortrait advances facial animation with improved emotion capture and multi-character support, supported by new datasets and benchmarks.

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multifaceted approach to diagnose wrist pathologies using limited datasets, combining fine-grained recognition, metadata fusion, and fine-grained pre-training, achieving improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing wrist pathologies is time-consuming and requires expertise, with limited datasets posing a challenge. Computer vision offers potential, but single-modality approaches are inadequate.

Method: The study uses fine-grained recognition for subtle X-ray pathologies, fuses patient metadata with images, and employs fine-grained pre-training instead of coarse datasets like ImageNet.

Result: Fine-grained strategies and metadata integration improved diagnostic accuracy by 2% with limited data and over 10% with a larger fracture-focused dataset.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of combining fine-grained recognition and metadata fusion for diagnosing wrist pathologies, even with limited datasets.

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

*Keli Deng,Jie Nie,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage method to reconstruct hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB images using a modified latent diffusion model (ULDM) that focuses on spectral-spatial joint distribution learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is challenging due to the unobservable spectral features in RGB images. Leveraging RGB pre-trained models can help model these features effectively.

Method: Extends RGB-LDM to ULDM, using a spectral unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) and spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) in a two-stage pipeline for spectral-spatial learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in SR and downstream tasks like relighting.

Conclusion: The ULDM effectively models unobservable spectral features, improving HSI reconstruction from RGB images.

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art

### [92] [Variance-Based Pruning for Accelerating and Compressing Trained Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12988)
*Uranik Berisha,Jens Mehnert,Alexandru Paul Condurache*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Variance-Based Pruning is introduced to compress large models like Vision Transformers efficiently, reducing computational costs and memory demands with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational and memory costs of large models like Vision Transformers motivate the need for efficient pruning methods to reuse trained networks without extensive retraining.

Method: The method involves gathering activation statistics to select neurons for pruning and integrating mean activations to preserve performance, requiring only minimal fine-tuning.

Result: On ImageNet-1k, DeiT-Base retains 70% performance post-pruning and regains 99% accuracy with 10 epochs of fine-tuning, reducing MACs by 35% and model size by 36%.

Conclusion: Variance-Based Pruning offers an efficient one-shot solution for compressing large models, maintaining performance while significantly reducing resource demands.

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

*Zihua Zhao,Feng Hong,Mengxi Chen,Pengyi Chen,Benyuan Liu,Jiangchao Yao,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DISSect, a Differential-Informed Sample Selection method, to efficiently address noisy correspondence in contrastive-learning-based multimodal models, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sample selection methods either rely on offline oracle models (inefficient for cold-start) or online predictions (ignoring noisy correspondence), prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: DISSect uses the differential between predicted correlations of current and historical models to characterize sample quality, enabling robust sample selection.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets show DISSect's consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DISSect effectively addresses noisy correspondence and accelerates training, demonstrating significant improvements in performance.

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

### [94] [Beyond Fully Supervised Pixel Annotations: Scribble-Driven Weakly-Supervised Framework for Image Manipulation Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13018)
*Songlin Li,Guofeng Yu,Zhiqing Guo,Yunfeng Diao,Dan Ma,Gaobo Yang,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scribble-based weakly supervised framework for image manipulation localization (IML) is proposed, outperforming fully supervised methods by leveraging scribble annotations and advanced modules for feature adjustment and fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of acquiring high-quality pixel-level annotations, this study explores scribble annotation supervision for efficient and effective IML.

Method: The framework includes self-supervised training with structural consistency loss, a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM), a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM), and a confidence-aware entropy minimization loss (L_CEM).

Result: The method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Scribble-based weak supervision is a viable and efficient alternative to pixel-level annotations for IML, with superior performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MaskGIL, an improved MAR model for image generation, matching AR model performance with fewer inference steps, and extends to text-driven and real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underperformance of MAR models compared to AR models in image generation by refining the architecture.

Method: Evaluates image tokenizers, introduces bidirectional attention and 2D RoPE in a Bidirectional LLaMA architecture, scaling parameters from 111M to 1.4B.

Result: MaskGIL achieves a FID score of 3.71, matching AR models on ImageNet 256x256 with only 8 inference steps, and extends to text-driven and real-time applications.

Conclusion: MaskGIL successfully bridges the performance gap between MAR and AR models, offering efficiency and versatility in image generation and beyond.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for complex wide-area scene understanding without additional fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes, prompting the need for an efficient method to improve their performance.

Method: HCS progressively refines selected regions using a theoretically guaranteed importance function, considering utility, representativeness, robustness, and synergy.

Result: HCS enables VLMs to rapidly understand unseen scenes at any scale with minimal interpretable regions, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: HCS is a plug-and-play solution that enhances VLM performance in complex scene understanding tasks without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

### [97] [Label-Consistent Dataset Distillation with Detector-Guided Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13074)
*Yawen Zou,Guang Li,Zi Wang,Chunzhi Gu,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A detector-guided dataset distillation framework improves synthetic dataset quality by refining anomalous samples using a pre-trained detector, ensuring label consistency and richer details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for dataset distillation often produce samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient detail, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous synthetic samples, generating multiple candidates and selecting the best based on confidence and diversity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with high-quality, detailed synthetic images.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses label and detail issues in dataset distillation, enhancing downstream performance.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

*Riku Inoue,Masamitsu Tsuchiya,Yuji Yasui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Channel-wise Motion Features for efficient motion segmentation, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve real-time performance in motion segmentation for safety-critical robotics by reducing reliance on multiple subnetworks.

Method: Uses a novel cost-volume-based motion feature representation (Channel-wise Motion Features) with only a Pose Network, eliminating other subnetworks.

Result: Achieves 4x FPS of state-of-the-art models on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets, with equivalent accuracy and 25% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The method is efficient and accurate, suitable for real-time applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

*Riku Inoue,Masamitsu Tsuchiya,Yuji Yasui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Decoupled PROB improves Open World Object Detection by resolving learning conflicts in PROB and introducing efficient feature extraction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions in PROB and enhance performance for unknown object detection.

Method: Introduces Early Termination of Objectness Prediction (ETOP) and Task-Decoupled Query Initialization (TDQI) to improve feature extraction and resolve conflicts.

Result: Decoupled PROB outperforms existing methods on OWOD benchmarks, showing significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: Decoupled PROB effectively resolves PROB's limitations and advances state-of-the-art in Open World Object Detection.

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

TL;DR: DiffOSeg is a two-stage diffusion-based framework for medical image segmentation that addresses annotation variability by combining consensus-driven and preference-driven approaches, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotation variability in medical image segmentation due to ambiguous boundaries and diverse expertise challenges traditional deep learning methods, which fail to capture annotator biases.

Method: DiffOSeg uses a two-stage approach: Stage I establishes population consensus probabilistically, and Stage II captures expert-specific preferences via adaptive prompts.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170 datasets across all metrics.

Conclusion: DiffOSeg effectively addresses annotation variability by integrating consensus and expert-specific preferences, offering a comprehensive solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

*Yuqi Peng,Pengfei Wang,Jianzhuang Liu,Shifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLAD (Generalizable LoRA tuning with RegulArized GraDient) is proposed to address overfitting and complexity in few-shot prompt tuning for vision-language models, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt tuning methods overfit in few-shot scenarios and rely on complex architectures, limiting general applicability.

Method: GLAD combines LoRA tuning with gradient-based regularization to stabilize optimization and improve robustness.

Result: GLAD outperforms previous methods in base-to-novel class, domain, and cross-dataset generalization across 15 benchmarks.

Conclusion: GLAD offers a simpler, more general solution for few-shot prompt tuning, enhancing robustness and performance.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated pipeline using deep learning (3D nnU-Net) for fetal lung segmentation and maturity assessment in MRI shows promise, matching manual segmentation accuracy (Dice 82.14%) and enabling clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation for fetal lung maturity assessment is time-consuming, limiting clinical applicability. Automation is needed.

Method: A 3D nnU-Net model was trained for lung segmentation on 4D MRI scans, followed by voxel-wise IVIM parameter fitting for maturity assessment.

Result: The automated segmentation achieved a mean Dice of 82.14%, with IVIM parameters comparable to manual segmentation.

Conclusion: The pipeline is viable for automated fetal lung maturity assessment, supporting clinical decisions.

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual concepts without catastrophic forgetting or excessive parameter growth.

Method: Proposes R²MoE with routing distillation, redundancy removal of experts, and hierarchical local attention-guided inference.

Result: Achieves 87.8% reduction in forgetting rates and 63.3% fewer parameters, outperforming SOTA on CustomConcept 101.

Conclusion: R²MoE effectively balances learning new concepts and parameter efficiency, demonstrating superior performance in lifelong visual concept learning.

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A registration-based framework for 3D anomaly detection using multi-prototype alignment and cluster-wise discrepancy analysis, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution 3D point clouds are effective for industrial inspection but face challenges like computational cost and misalignment sensitivity.

Method: Combines multi-prototype alignment with keypoint-guided clustering for localized structural comparison.

Result: Achieves top performance on the Real3D-AD benchmark for object- and point-level anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The method enables precise anomaly localization using raw features, addressing challenges in 3D point cloud analysis.

Abstract: High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

*Pranav Singh,Pravendra Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal IRSTD framework combines image and language data to improve small target detection in infrared images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRSTD methods rely only on image data, missing the potential of language priors to enhance detection.

Method: The framework uses language-guided attention weights from text descriptions (generated by GPT-4) to improve detection, and introduces a new multimodal dataset.

Result: Significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with notable gains in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa metrics.

Conclusion: Incorporating language priors into IRSTD enhances performance, and the new dataset supports future multimodal research.

Abstract: IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared
blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

*Xiaozheng Jiang,Wei Zhang,Xuerui Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-TinyNet improves tiny object detection in remote sensing by introducing saliency modeling and feature reconstruction, outperforming SOTA methods by 4.0% AP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tiny objects in remote sensing imagery are hard to detect due to limited spatial info, weak features, and dense distributions.

Method: RS-TinyNet uses multi-stage feature fusion with modules like MDCA for saliency, ARB for info flow, and PFDH for multi-level fusion.

Result: Achieves 4.0% AP and 6.5% AP75 improvements on AI-TOD, validated on DIOR dataset.

Conclusion: Multi-stage feature fusion is effective for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINO-VO integrates DINOv2's visual foundation model for robust monocular visual odometry, addressing feature granularity with a tailored keypoints detector and geometric features, achieving superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robustness, generalization, and efficiency in learning-based monocular visual odometry by leveraging DINOv2's capabilities while overcoming its coarse feature limitations.

Method: Proposes DINO-VO, combining DINOv2's semantic features with fine-grained geometric features, a transformer-based matcher, and differentiable pose estimation for precise motion tracking.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on TartanAir, KITTI, and EuRoC datasets, runs at 72 FPS with <1GB memory, and competes with Visual SLAM in outdoor scenarios.

Conclusion: DINO-VO successfully integrates DINOv2 for robust VO, demonstrating improved accuracy, generalization, and efficiency, making it competitive with advanced SLAM systems.

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SE-VLN, a self-evolving vision-language navigation framework, addressing limitations of fixed knowledge in LLMs by enabling continuous evolution during testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN methods rely on fixed LLM knowledge, lacking experiential learning and evolutionary capacity. Inspired by natural agents, the authors aim to create a self-evolving VLN agent.

Method: SE-VLN includes hierarchical memory for knowledge transfer, retrieval-augmented reasoning for multi-step decisions, and a reflection module for continual evolution.

Result: SE-VLN achieved 57% and 35.2% success rates in unseen environments, improving state-of-the-art by 23.9% and 15.0% on R2R and REVERSE datasets. Performance improved with experience.

Conclusion: SE-VLN demonstrates significant performance gains and scalability, proving its potential as a self-evolving VLN framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A world model for autonomous driving achieves state-of-the-art performance with simple design, outperforming in challenging scenarios like turns and urban traffic. Continuous autoregressive models are favored over discrete token models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of existing world models in long-horizon generation and generalization to challenging scenarios without extra supervision or sensors.

Method: Develops a model with simple design choices, trained on 280h of video data (469M parameters), and compares discrete token models vs. continuous autoregressive models using a hybrid tokenizer.

Result: State-of-the-art performance, especially in difficult scenarios like turning and urban traffic. Continuous models outperform discrete ones in robustness and power.

Conclusion: Continuous autoregressive models are superior to discrete token models, being less brittle and more powerful. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method using Midjourney to generate synthetic images for construction worker detection improves DNN training, showing high performance on synthetic data but mixed results on real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of diverse and voluminous training data in the construction domain for visual AI applications.

Method: Generates 12,000 synthetic images via 3,000 Midjourney prompts, focusing on realism and diversity, then manually labels them for DNN training.

Result: Achieved APs of 0.937 (IoU 0.5) and 0.642 (IoU 0.5-0.95) on real data; near-perfect APs (0.994 and 0.919) on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Generative AI shows promise for mitigating data scarcity but has limitations in real-world applicability.

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

*Keerthi Veeramachaneni,Praveen Tirupattur,Amrit Singh Bedi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to detect AI-generated videos using pre-trained visual models, achieving over 90% accuracy on a custom dataset (VID-AID).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in detecting AI-generated videos beyond deepfakes, crucial for combating misinformation, privacy, and security threats.

Method: Leverages pre-trained visual models to extract features distinguishing real from generated videos, with a linear classification layer for improved performance.

Result: Achieves high detection accuracy (above 90%) on a dataset of 10,000 AI-generated and 4,000 real videos.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and plans to release code, models, and dataset to aid further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

TL;DR: $S^2M^2$ introduces a global matching architecture for stereo matching, balancing accuracy and efficiency without cost volume filtering, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between local search methods (limited global consistency) and global matching architectures (historically impractical due to computational costs).

Method: Uses a multi-resolution transformer for long-range correspondence and a novel loss function to focus on feasible matches, jointly estimating disparity, occlusion, and confidence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, outperforming prior methods in most metrics with competitive efficiency.

Conclusion: $S^2M^2$ resolves the trade-off, offering a robust and efficient solution for generalizable stereo matching.

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

### [113] [VITA: Vision-to-Action Flow Matching Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13231)
*Dechen Gao,Boqi Zhao,Andrew Lee,Ian Chuang,Hanchu Zhou,Hang Wang,Zhe Zhao,Junshan Zhang,Iman Soltani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VITA is a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that maps latent visual representations to actions, eliminating conditioning overheads and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flow matching policies require additional conditioning mechanisms for visual information, creating inefficiencies. VITA aims to simplify this by learning an inherent vision-to-action mapping.

Method: VITA uses a structured action latent space via an autoencoder, up-sampling actions to match visual shapes, and supervises flow matching with encoder targets and action outputs for end-to-end learning.

Result: VITA outperforms state-of-the-art generative policies, reducing inference latency by 50-130% and successfully solving complex bi-manual manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: VITA demonstrates the effectiveness of MLP-only flow matching policies for visuomotor control, offering simplicity and efficiency.

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

*Yiting Yang,Hao Luo,Yuan Sun,Qingsen Yan,Haokui Zhang,Wei Dong,Guoqing Wang,Peng Wang,Yang Yang,Hengtao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for Vision Transformers (ViT) to enhance generalization by aligning the properties of low-rank adaptation matrices with the backbone's orthogonality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The observation that pre-trained backbone weight matrices exhibit approximate orthogonality, which improves generalization, while low-rank adaptation matrices (e.g., in LoRA or Adapter) do not. The goal is to enhance generalization in fine-tuned ViTs by enforcing orthogonality in these matrices.

Method: AOFT uses a single learnable vector to generate approximately orthogonal vectors for down/up-projection matrices, aligning them with the backbone's properties.

Result: AOFT achieves competitive performance in downstream image classification tasks, confirming improved generalization.

Conclusion: Enforcing orthogonality in low-rank adaptation matrices enhances the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs, as demonstrated by AOFT's effectiveness.

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

TL;DR: DiffClean uses a text-guided diffusion model to remove makeup traces, improving age verification and face recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protect underage users from accessing age-restricted online services by addressing makeup-induced inaccuracies in age estimation.

Method: Proposes DiffClean, a text-guided diffusion model to erase makeup traces from facial images.

Result: Improves minor vs. adult accuracy by 4.8% and face verification TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%.

Conclusion: DiffClean effectively counters makeup attacks, enhancing age verification and face recognition systems.

Abstract: Accurate age verification can protect underage users from unauthorized access
to online platforms and e-commerce sites that provide age-restricted services.
However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and
age to fool both humans and machines. In this work, we propose DiffClean which
erases makeup traces using a text-guided diffusion model to defend against
makeup attacks. DiffClean improves age estimation (minor vs. adult accuracy by
4.8%) and face verification (TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%) over competing baselines
on digitally simulated and real makeup images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack flexibility in pose and lighting, limiting personalized fashion previews.

Method: FashionPose predicts 2D poses from text, generates images using a diffusion model, and applies a relighting module, all text-guided.

Result: The framework achieves fine-grained pose synthesis and consistent relighting, enhancing virtual fashion display.

Conclusion: FashionPose offers a practical, unified solution for personalized garment visualization with text-driven control.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion
e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and
lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting
semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we
introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person
images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the
same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven
conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment
rendering, and flexible lighting control. Experiments demonstrate fine-grained
pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical
solution for personalized virtual fashion display.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical reproducibility and benchmark-quality issues in the RPE benchmark, which hinder fair and consistent evaluations of pose-aware MLLMs.

Method: Refined ground-truth annotations through meticulous visual matching to resolve discrepancies in image indices and benchmark-quality limitations.

Result: Publicly released refined annotations as an open-source resource to enhance reproducibility and enable consistent evaluations.

Conclusion: The refined annotations alleviate manual effort, improve benchmark reliability, and support future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-object interaction detection is challenging but crucial for intuitive user experiences in real-time applications.

Method: The approach combines an action recognition module (Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 backbone) and an object detection module (fine-tuned YOLOWorld) in a cascaded architecture.

Result: The model achieves 38.52% p-AP for action recognition and 85.13% AP for object detection on benchmarks, operating at 30fps.

Conclusion: The cascaded architecture effectively detects hand-object interactions in real time, balancing speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

Result: Achieves over 10 FPS on iPhone 16 Pro Max, enabling real-time, high-quality video generation.

Conclusion: Proposed optimizations make DiT feasible for mobile platforms without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number
of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to
achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max,

TL;DR: A novel sliding iterative denoising process enhances spatio-temporal consistency in 4D diffusion models for high-fidelity human view synthesis from sparse-view videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D diffusion models for view synthesis lack spatio-temporal consistency, degrading output quality.

Method: Proposes a sliding iterative denoising process on a latent grid encoding images, poses, and timestamps, alternating between spatial and temporal dimensions.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets, producing high-quality, consistent novel-view videos.

Conclusion: The method improves 4D consistency and GPU efficiency, advancing high-fidelity human view synthesis.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual generation models struggle with stable and accurate responses when dealing with complex concepts and their combinations, which is an under-explored problem area that affects the reliability of generated visual content.

Method: The authors propose a concept-wise equalization loss function called IMBA loss that operates online without requiring offline dataset processing and can be implemented with minimal code changes to existing models.

Result: The proposed method significantly enhances concept response capability of baseline models and achieves highly competitive results on the newly introduced Inert-CompBench benchmark as well as two other public test sets, demonstrating improved stability in handling complex concepts.

Conclusion: The IMBA loss function effectively addresses the stability issues in complex concept responses for visual generation tasks, providing a practical and efficient solution that can be easily integrated into existing models with minimal implementation overhead.

Abstract: In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex

under-explored area. In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors
for poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also
design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this
issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset
processing, and requires minimal code changes. In our newly proposed complex
concept benchmark Inert-CompBench and two other public test sets, our method
significantly enhances the concept response capability of baseline models and
yields highly competitive results with only a few codes.

*Minghao Chen,Jianyuan Wang,Roman Shapovalov,Tom Monnier,Hyunyoung Jung,Dilin Wang,Rakesh Ranjan,Iro Laina,Andrea Vedaldi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoPartGen is an autoregressive model for generating 3D objects composed of parts, using inputs like images, masks, or existing 3D objects. It leverages a latent space with strong compositional properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable part-based 3D object generation with flexibility in input types (images, masks, or 3D objects) and automatic determination of part types and counts.

Method: AutoPartGen autoregressively predicts parts one at a time, conditioning on prior parts and additional inputs, using the 3DShape2VecSet latent space for geometric expressiveness.

Result: The model generates coherent 3D objects or scenes without additional optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance in part-level and overall 3D generation.

Conclusion: AutoPartGen demonstrates effective part-based 3D generation with strong compositional capabilities and high-quality results.

Abstract: We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

*Yichi Zhang,Yici Yan,Alex Schwing,Zhizhen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces mini-batch couplings in hierarchical flow matching to adjust distribution complexity across hierarchy levels, improving performance on synthetic and imaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical flow matching captures multi-modal velocity fields but lacks complexity variation across hierarchy levels, limiting its effectiveness.

Method: Proposes mini-batch couplings to gradually adjust distribution complexity in hierarchical rectified flow matching.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance on synthetic and imaging data.

Conclusion: Mini-batch couplings enhance hierarchical flow matching by enabling complexity adjustment, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoITG improves Video-LLMs by aligning frame sampling with user instructions via VidThinker, achieving better performance in video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for video frame selection struggle with complex long video scenarios and lack instruction alignment.

Method: Proposes VideoITG with VidThinker pipeline: generates clip-level captions, retrieves relevant segments, and selects informative frames.

Result: Constructs VideoITG-40K dataset and achieves consistent performance improvements in benchmarks.

Conclusion: VideoITG demonstrates superiority and potential for enhancing video understanding with Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of simulating hair dynamics that generalize across diverse hairstyles, body shapes, and motions.

Method: A Transformer-powered static network predicts static draped shapes, resolving penetrations. A dynamic network with cross-attention fuses static hair features with kinematic input for expressive dynamics.

Result: Real-time inference for static and dynamic drapes, high-fidelity dynamics, and broad generalization, even for unseen long hairstyles.

Conclusion: The method effectively generalizes hair dynamics, resolving penetrations and preserving fidelity, with real-time performance.

Abstract: Simulating hair dynamics that generalize across arbitrary hairstyles, body
shapes, and motions is a critical challenge. Our novel two-stage neural
solution is the first to leverage Transformer-based architectures for such a
broad generalization. We propose a Transformer-powered static network that
predicts static draped shapes for any hairstyle, effectively resolving
hair-body penetrations and preserving hair fidelity. Subsequently, a dynamic
network with a novel cross-attention mechanism fuses static hair features with
kinematic input to generate expressive dynamics and complex secondary motions.
This dynamic network also allows for efficient fine-tuning of challenging
motion sequences, such as abrupt head movements. Our method offers real-time
inference for both static single-frame drapes and dynamic drapes over pose
sequences. Our method demonstrates high-fidelity and generalizable dynamic hair
across various styles, guided by physics-informed losses, and can resolve
penetrations even for complex, unseen long hairstyles, highlighting its broad
generalization.

Abstract: The $\star_M$-family of tensor-tensor products is a framework which

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between idealized VLN assumptions and real-world robotic deployment challenges.

Method: VLN-PE evaluates VLN methods in physical settings, including classification models, diffusion models, and LLM-path planning integration.

Result: Performance degradation due to observation limits, lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions. Locomotion constraints for legged robots are also highlighted.

Conclusion: VLN-PE offers a pathway for improving cross-embodiment adaptability and encourages rethinking VLN limitations for robust models.

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but
their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR simulation methods inadequately address sensor-specific effects, limiting accuracy in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) applications.

Method: The approach explicitly models LiDAR sensor characteristics (rolling shutter, laser power variations, intensity falloff) to improve simulation accuracy.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative comparisons show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies validating the importance of each sensor model component.

Conclusion: The method enhances LiDAR simulation accuracy and demonstrates advanced resimulation capabilities, such as high-resolution scans from camera perspectives.

Abstract: Methods for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) have recently found traction in the
field of LiDAR simulation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. While
solutions for faster rendering or handling dynamic scenes have been proposed,
LiDAR specific effects remain insufficiently addressed. By explicitly modeling
sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and
intensity falloff, our method achieves more accurate LiDAR simulation compared
to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods,
as well as ablation studies that highlight the importance of each sensor model
component. Beyond that, we show that our approach exhibits advanced
resimulation capabilities, such as generating high resolution LiDAR scans in
the camera perspective.

TL;DR: The paper explores using a dual-LiDAR system for Traffic Movement Count (TMC) estimation at intersections, addressing limitations of traditional methods like cameras under poor lighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TMC methods (e.g., cameras) are unreliable in harsh weather or nighttime. LiDAR offers a cost-effective, accurate alternative for 3D object detection and tracking.

Method: A dual-LiDAR system was deployed in Rialto, California, using 3D bounding box detections to classify vehicle counts by direction, movement, and class.

Result: The system provided TMC estimates and identified trends/irregularities, showcasing LiDAR's potential for accurate traffic monitoring.

Conclusion: LiDAR-based TMC estimation is promising, with potential for improvements in trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.

Abstract: Traffic Movement Count (TMC) at intersections is crucial for optimizing
signal timings, assessing the performance of existing traffic control measures,
and proposing efficient lane configurations to minimize delays, reduce
congestion, and promote safety. Traditionally, methods such as manual counting,
loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been
used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC
estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh
weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its
expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This
paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a
dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC
estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to
classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and
vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides
insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements
are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also
trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.

Motivation: Existing SLU methods use separate models for tasks like spoken NER and SA, increasing complexity and limiting cross-task synergy.

Method: Proposes a unified representation and generative method for joint modeling of ASR, spoken NER, and SA, leveraging large language models.

Result: Outperforms benchmark methods on public SLU datasets, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: UniSLU is effective for real-world speech applications, with code and models to be released for further research.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays a crucial role in speech-centric
multimedia applications, enabling machines to comprehend spoken language in
scenarios such as meetings, interviews, and customer service interactions. SLU
encompasses multiple tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER), and spoken Sentiment Analysis (SA).
However, existing methods often rely on separate model architectures for
individual tasks such as spoken NER and SA, which increases system complexity,
limits cross-task interaction, and fails to fully exploit heterogeneous
datasets available across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
UniSLU, a unified framework that jointly models multiple SLU tasks within a
single architecture. Specifically, we propose a unified representation for
diverse SLU tasks, enabling full utilization of heterogeneous datasets across
multiple tasks. Built upon this representation, we propose a unified generative
method that jointly models ASR, spoken NER, and SA tasks, enhancing task
interactions and enabling seamless integration with large language models to
harness their powerful generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on public
SLU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior
SLU performance compared to several benchmark methods, making it well-suited
for real-world speech-based multimedia scenarios. We will release all code and
models at github to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the computational complexity of diffusion-based language models, showing a dichotomy: exact score-matching limits models to TC⁰, while no such restriction allows Turing machine simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand the capabilities and limitations of diffusion models in language modeling, especially for sequential computation tasks.

Method: Proves a dichotomy based on score-matching network quality: exact matching restricts to TC⁰, while no restriction enables Turing machine simulation.

Result: Exact score-matching confines models to TC⁰; no restriction allows broader computational power.

Conclusion: The dichotomy highlights theoretical trade-offs in diffusion models, suggesting hybrid architectures may outperform Transformers and diffusion models.

Abstract: This paper explores the computational complexity of diffusion-based language
modeling. We prove a dichotomy based on the quality of the score-matching
network in a diffusion model. In one direction, a network that exactly computes
the score function of some initial distribution can only perform language
modeling within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class, reflecting limitations
tied to rapid convergence. In the other direction, we show that if there is no
requirement for the network to match any score function, then diffusion
modeling can simulate any Turing machine in a certain sense. This dichotomy
provides a theoretical lens on the capabilities and limitations of diffusion
models, particularly concerning tasks requiring sequential computation. We
conjecture extensions of our theoretical results, including for the case where
the diffusion model is not perfect, but merely good. We also discuss the wider
context and practical implications, and hypothesize that a machine learning
architecture that can interpolate between sequential and parallel modes of
operation would be superior to both Transformers and diffusion models.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PaPIS, a pathology-aware image similarity metric for evaluating virtual staining, outperforming traditional metrics by aligning better with histological quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for virtual staining, like FR-IQA metrics and expert reviews, are inadequate as they either miss pathology-relevant features or are subjective and slow.

Method: PaPIS combines deep learning-based features trained on cell morphology segmentation and Retinex-inspired decomposition to assess histological quality.

Result: PaPIS aligns better with pathology-relevant visual cues and improves virtual staining models when used as a guiding loss function.

Conclusion: Pathology-aware evaluation frameworks like PaPIS are essential for advancing virtual staining technologies toward clinical use.

Abstract: Virtual staining has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional
histopathological staining techniques, enabling rapid, reagent-free image
transformations. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly rely on
full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics such as structural
similarity, which are originally designed for natural images and often fail to
capture pathology-relevant features. Expert pathology reviews have also been
used, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming.
  In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image
Similarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining
evaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell
morphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition
to better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments
demonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual
cues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing
perceptual metrics tend to overlook. Furthermore, integrating PaPIS as a
guiding loss function in a virtual staining model leads to improved
histological fidelity.
  This work highlights the critical need for pathology-aware evaluation
frameworks to advance the development and clinical readiness of virtual
staining technologies.

TL;DR: InSight is an AI-based app for diagnosing five common eye diseases using fundus images and patient metadata, improving accessibility in resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited access to medical care for early screening of eye diseases in low- and middle-income countries necessitates an accessible, accurate diagnostic tool.

Method: InSight uses a three-stage pipeline: image quality assessment, disease diagnosis (with MetaFusion for multimodal data, pretraining, and multitask learning), and DR grading. Datasets include BRSET and mBRSET.

Result: The pipeline achieves near-100% image quality accuracy and outperforms image-only models by 4-6% in balanced accuracy. It is computationally efficient.

Conclusion: InSight is robust, accurate, and efficient, generalizing across image sources and diseases while being lightweight.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic
retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular edema, and pathological myopia affect
hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Early screening for these diseases is
essential, yet access to medical care remains limited in low- and middle-income
countries as well as in resource-limited settings. We develop InSight, an
AI-based app that combines patient metadata with fundus images for accurate
diagnosis of five common eye diseases to improve accessibility of screenings.
  Methods: InSight features a three-stage pipeline: real-time image quality
assessment, disease diagnosis model, and a DR grading model to assess severity.
Our disease diagnosis model incorporates three key innovations: (a) Multimodal
fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b)
Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions;
and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of
BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets,
both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.
  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality
checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images.
The multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only
images by 6% in balanced accuracy for BRSET and 4% for mBRSET.
  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image
conditions and has high diagnostic accuracy across all five diseases,
generalizing to both smartphone and lab captured images. The multitask model
contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it five times
computationally efficient compared to having five individual models
corresponding to each disease.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of No-Reference IQA due to lack of reference images and limited labeled data motivates the development of a new approach.

Method: The method involves constructing a custom dataset and training a quality-aware model using contrastive triplet-based learning for efficient training with fewer samples.

Result: The model achieves strong generalization performance across publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances NR-IQA by addressing data scarcity and improving generalization with fewer samples.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models aim to predict perceptual image quality
in alignment with human judgments. No-Reference (NR) IQA remains particularly
challenging due to the absence of a reference image. While deep learning has
significantly advanced this field, a major hurdle in developing NR-IQA models
is the limited availability of subjectively labeled data. Most existing deep
learning-based NR-IQA approaches rely on pre-training on large-scale datasets
before fine-tuning for IQA tasks. To further advance progress in this area, we
propose a novel approach that constructs a custom dataset using a limited
number of reference content images and introduces a no-reference IQA model that
incorporates both content and quality features for perceptual quality
prediction. Specifically, we train a quality-aware model using contrastive
triplet-based learning, enabling efficient training with fewer samples while
achieving strong generalization performance across publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: Pixel Perfect MegaMed advances high-resolution medical image synthesis and proves useful for data augmentation.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis presents unique challenges due to the inherent
complexity and high-resolution details required in clinical contexts.
Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for
high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained
details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we
introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to
synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale
transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution
medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical
context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment
techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel
Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual
representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the
CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful
chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution
synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification,
showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation,
particularly in low-data regimes. Our code is accessible through the project

TL;DR: A novel segmentation framework using vision foundation models (VFMs) with parallel encoding (ViT and CNN) and uncertainty refinement for accurate coronary artery segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary artery segmentation is challenging due to small size, complex morphology, and low contrast, necessitating advanced solutions for CAD diagnosis.

Method: Combines ViT for global features (enhanced by AGE module) and CNN for local details, fused via CVF module. Adds EUR module for uncertainty refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on in-house and public datasets, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses segmentation challenges, offering high accuracy and robustness for CAD diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate coronary artery segmentation is critical for computeraided diagnosis
of coronary artery disease (CAD), yet it remains challenging due to the small
size, complex morphology, and low contrast with surrounding tissues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel segmentation framework that leverages the
power of vision foundation models (VFMs) through a parallel encoding
architecture. Specifically, a vision transformer (ViT) encoder within the VFM
captures global structural features, enhanced by the activation of the final
two ViT blocks and the integration of an attention-guided enhancement (AGE)
module, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder extracts local
details. These complementary features are adaptively fused using a cross-branch
variational fusion (CVF) module, which models latent distributions and applies
variational attention to assign modality-specific weights. Additionally, we
introduce an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module, which
quantifies uncertainty using evidence theory and refines uncertain regions by
incorporating multi-scale feature aggregation and attention mechanisms, further
enhancing segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on one in-house and two

outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
accurate coronary artery segmentation and showcasing strong generalization

*Jinseo An,Min Jin Lee,Kyu Won Shim,Helen Hong*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel framework improves orbital bone segmentation in CT images by using multiple diffusion model outputs and consensus-driven correction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of orbital bones is crucial for customized implants, but existing methods struggle with ambiguous boundaries and thin structures like the orbital medial wall and floor.

Method: The approach uses a conditional Bernoulli diffusion model trained on diverse annotations to generate multiple segmentations, then applies consensus-driven correction based on position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction similarity.

Result: The method outperforms existing techniques, enhancing recall in ambiguous regions and maintaining thin structure continuity, while automating manual correction processes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses segmentation challenges in orbital bones, offering potential for image-guided surgical planning and surgery.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of orbital bones in facial computed tomography (CT)
images is essential for the creation of customized implants for reconstruction
of defected orbital bones, particularly challenging due to the ambiguous
boundaries and thin structures such as the orbital medial wall and orbital
floor. In these ambiguous regions, existing segmentation approaches often
output disconnected or under-segmented results. We propose a novel framework
that corrects segmentation results by leveraging consensus from multiple
diffusion model outputs. Our approach employs a conditional Bernoulli diffusion
model trained on diverse annotation patterns per image to generate multiple
plausible segmentations, followed by a consensus-driven correction that
incorporates position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction
similarity to correct challenging regions. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing methods, significantly improving recall in
ambiguous regions while preserving the continuity of thin structures.
Furthermore, our method automates the manual process of segmentation result
correction and can be applied to image-guided surgical planning and surgery.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces fastWDM3D, a 3D wavelet diffusion model for healthy tissue inpainting, achieving high-quality results in just two time steps and significantly faster than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slow sampling speed of DDPMs in healthy tissue inpainting while maintaining high-quality results.

Method: Combines DDPMs with GANs and a variance-preserving noise schedule, then adapts it to a 3D wavelet diffusion model (fastWDM3D) without GANs.

Result: Achieved SSIM of 0.8571, MSE of 0.0079, and PSNR of 22.26, completing inpainting in 1.81s per image (800x faster than other DDPMs).

Conclusion: fastWDM3D is a fast and accurate solution for healthy tissue inpainting, outperforming existing methods in speed and performance.

Abstract: Healthy tissue inpainting has significant applications, including the
generation of pseudo-healthy baselines for tumor growth models and the
facilitation of image registration. In previous editions of the BraTS Local
Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but
suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D
image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks
(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D
inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule
and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for
high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial
training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet
diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting
model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a
PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these
scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81
s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue
inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior
performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising
approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting. Our code is available
at https://github.com/AliciaDurrer/fastWDM3D.

*Ritik Shah,Marco F. Duarte*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SpectraLift is a self-supervised framework for fusing low-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) with high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) using only the MSI's spectral response function, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) are crucial but challenging to obtain due to trade-offs between spatial and spectral detail. Existing methods require impractical calibration or ground truth data.

Method: SpectraLift trains a lightweight MLP network using synthetic LR-MSI from LR-HSI and SRF, with LR-HSI as output and spectral reconstruction loss. It maps HR-MSI to HR-HSI at inference.

Result: SpectraLift outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks (PSNR, SAM, SSIM, RMSE), converges quickly, and is agnostic to spatial blur/resolution.

Conclusion: SpectraLift offers a practical, efficient, and high-performing solution for HSI-MSI fusion without requiring impractical calibration or ground truth data.

Abstract: High-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) are essential for
applications such as remote sensing and medical imaging, yet HSI sensors
inherently trade spatial detail for spectral richness. Fusing
high-spatial-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) with
low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) is a promising route to
recover fine spatial structures without sacrificing spectral fidelity. Most
state-of-the-art methods for HSI-MSI fusion demand point spread function (PSF)
calibration or ground truth high resolution HSI (HR-HSI), both of which are
impractical to obtain in real world settings. We present SpectraLift, a fully
self-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the
MSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight
per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic
low-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the
SRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an
$\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as
the optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network
to map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate. SpectraLift converges in
minutes, is agnostic to spatial blur and resolution, and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PMKLC, a parallel multi-knowledge learning-based compressor, improves compression ratio, throughput, and robustness for genomic data, outperforming 14 baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based compressors for genomic data suffer from inadequate compression ratio, low throughput, and poor robustness, limiting their adoption.

Method: PMKLC introduces a multi-knowledge learning framework, GPU-accelerated encoding, parallel mechanisms, and two compression modes (single/multi-GPU).

Result: PMKLC-S/M achieves up to 73.6% better compression ratio and 10.7x higher throughput than baselines, with superior robustness and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: PMKLC is a scalable, efficient, and robust solution for genomic data compression, suitable for diverse applications.

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale
genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their
1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression
throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption
and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we
propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge
\underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial
designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression
framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness;
2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15
real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to
baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression
ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput
improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability
distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARES is a probabilistic framework for detecting propagated errors in LLM reasoning chains by judging claims based on sound premises, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Initial errors in LLM reasoning chains propagate and undermine reliability, but current detection methods fail to address this properly.

Method: Introduces ARES, an autoregressive framework that evaluates claims using only sound premises, providing nuanced scores and statistical guarantees.

Result: ARES achieves state-of-the-art performance (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2 points) and excels in detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6 points).

Conclusion: ARES effectively mitigates error propagation in LLM reasoning, offering robust and certified detection.

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

Motivation: Addressing the limitation of SAEs in capturing domain-specific features not prevalent in their training data.

Method: Training a secondary SAE to model reconstruction errors of a pretrained SAE on domain-specific texts, combining outputs during inference.

Result: Significant improvements in LLM cross-entropy and explained variance metrics across specialized domains.

Conclusion: Enables selective enhancement of SAE interpretability for specific domains, advancing targeted mechanistic interpretability of LLMs.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the
internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to
capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This
paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature
blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a
secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained
SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the
primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we
demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained
variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that
this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs
while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables
researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of
interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability
of LLMs.

Conclusion: Integrating cross-modality alignment for sample selection advances data-centric learning, making it more efficient and robust across domains.

Abstract: Modern deep models are trained on large real-world datasets, where data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate, automated infrastructure health monitoring without preprocessing, leveraging spectral and temporal information from vibration signals.

Method: Combines Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) for spectral feature extraction, 1D Inception networks for multi-scale features, and BiLSTM for temporal dependencies and health estimation.

Result: The model significantly outperforms existing methods in estimating railway ballast and railpad stiffness parameters.

Conclusion: The framework enables high-resolution, automated infrastructure health monitoring, validated by a railway track case study.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for infrastructure
health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

Conclusion: DASViT successfully bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs, offering innovative and efficient designs.

Abstract: Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in
discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational

Conclusion: MUPAX provides precise, consistent, and understandable explanations, advancing trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model

AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious

tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the

### [154] [From Roots to Rewards: Dynamic Tree Reasoning with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13142)
*Ahmed Bahloul,Simon Malberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dynamic reinforcement learning framework improves tree-structured reasoning by enabling adaptive construction and selective expansion, addressing limitations of static methods like ProbTree.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the static nature and computational inefficiency of existing tree-structured reasoning methods (e.g., ProbTree) in language models.

Method: Introduces a dynamic reinforcement learning framework that incrementally builds reasoning trees using real-time confidence estimates and learns optimal policies for action selection.

Result: Enhances solution quality and computational efficiency by dynamically adapting the reasoning process and focusing resources.

Conclusion: The framework balances probabilistic rigor with flexibility, advancing tree-structured reasoning for real-world question answering.

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

### [155] [The Generative Energy Arena (GEA): Incorporating Energy Awareness in Large Language Model (LLM) Human Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13302)
*Carlos Arriaga,Gonzalo Martínez,Eneko Sendin,Javier Conde,Pedro Reviriego*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEA, an evaluation arena for LLMs that includes energy consumption data, showing users prefer smaller, energy-efficient models when aware of energy costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation methods (automated benchmarks or human studies) have limitations like poor human correlation or scalability issues. Public arenas like LM arena offer a scalable alternative, but energy consumption's role in model selection is unexplored.

Method: GEA (Generative Energy Arena) incorporates energy consumption data into the evaluation process, allowing users to rank models while considering energy efficiency.

Result: Preliminary results show users favor smaller, energy-efficient models when energy consumption is disclosed, suggesting top-performing models' extra cost isn't justified by perceived quality.

Conclusion: Energy awareness influences model selection, favoring efficiency over performance, indicating a need to balance quality and sustainability in LLM evaluations.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Result: The survey highlights advancements, trends, and gaps in LLM-integrated AIOps, including novel tasks and LLM-based techniques for processing legacy and new data.

Conclusion: The study identifies gaps in current research and proposes future directions for leveraging LLMs in AIOps.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow increasingly sophisticated and
pervasive, their application to various Artificial Intelligence for IT
Operations (AIOps) tasks has garnered significant attention. However, a
comprehensive understanding of the impact, potential, and limitations of LLMs
in AIOps remains in its infancy. To address this gap, we conducted a detailed
survey of LLM4AIOps, focusing on how LLMs can optimize processes and improve
outcomes in this domain. We analyzed 183 research papers published between
January 2020 and December 2024 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In
RQ1, we examine the diverse failure data sources utilized, including advanced
LLM-based processing techniques for legacy data and the incorporation of new
data sources enabled by LLMs. RQ2 explores the evolution of AIOps tasks,
highlighting the emergence of novel tasks and the publication trends across
these tasks. RQ3 investigates the various LLM-based methods applied to address
AIOps challenges. Finally, RQ4 reviews evaluation methodologies tailored to
assess LLM-integrated AIOps approaches. Based on our findings, we discuss the
state-of-the-art advancements and trends, identify gaps in existing research,
and propose promising directions for future exploration.

### [157] [A Fuzzy Approach to Project Success: Measuring What Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12653)
*João Granja-Correia,Remedios Hernández-Linares,Luca Ferranti,Arménio Rego*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A novel fuzzy logic-based approach for project success evaluation, addressing limitations of traditional Likert-scale measures by focusing on sustained positive impact for end-users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Likert-scale measures fail to capture the context-dependent and multifaceted nature of project success, necessitating a more dynamic and accurate evaluation method.

Method: A hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system is proposed, prioritizing end-user impact over secondary outcomes like stakeholder satisfaction.

Result: The approach offers a more accurate and adaptable measure of project success, suitable for complex evaluations.

Conclusion: Future research will focus on empirical testing and expanding fuzzy logic applications in social science.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to project success evaluation by
integrating fuzzy logic into an existing construct. Traditional Likert-scale
measures often overlook the context-dependent and multifaceted nature of
project success. The proposed hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system
prioritizes sustained positive impact for end-users, reducing emphasis on
secondary outcomes like stakeholder satisfaction and internal project success.
This dynamic approach may provide a more accurate measure of project success
and could be adaptable to complex evaluations. Future research will focus on
empirical testing and broader applications of fuzzy logic in social science.
