Among these, long-context referencing -- a\ncrucial task that requires LCLMs to attribute items of interest to specific\nparts of long-context data -- remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this\npaper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models\n(Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing\ncapability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the\nindexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual\nrelationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval. Based on\nthe task design, we construct three subsets ranging from synthetic to realistic\nscenarios to form the Ref-Long benchmark. Experimental results of 13 LCLMs\nreveal significant shortcomings in long-context referencing, even among\nadvanced models like GPT-4o. To further investigate these challenges, we\nconduct comprehensive analyses, including human evaluations, task format\nadjustments, fine-tuning experiments, and error analyses, leading to several\nkey insights.

This is a challenging problem particularly when\nrendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures\nand expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads,\nincluding skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple\nlocally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable\ncreating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In\ncontrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we\ncondition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and\nsynthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a\npatch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how\nto translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling\nthe patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene\nrepresentation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians\non-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ\ncolor-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality\nresults and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images.
